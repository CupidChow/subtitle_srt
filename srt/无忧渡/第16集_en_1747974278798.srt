CLUTCH

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:54,800
【嚷Up the

3
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,560
Hey, try it.

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Is it expensive?

5
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Xu Qiu, are you okay?

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm fine.

7
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,720
I was looking for a Bodhisattva.

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,440
He told me to find a suitable house.

9
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,280
I hope I'll have good news in the next few days.

10
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,200
How long will you stay in the house?

11
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,960
By the end of this month,

12
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
when Sister Jili left,

13
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
the house was in bad shape.

14
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
The black-hearted He Banchu

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,280
had already returned the house

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
and let us live in it.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
Is that what people do?

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,080
If you haven't found a house

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,560
by the end of this month,

20
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
then move in with me.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,920
No, no.

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
I can find a house.

23
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,960
Besides, the four of us live together.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,720
It's not a big deal for me to leave alone.

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,280
What's wrong? Do you know each other?

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,320
I'll wait for you here.

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Okay.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,440
Xue Yi.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,600
It's really you.

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,120
I was shocked when I saw you.

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,520
Why are you here too?

32
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,920
I went to the temple with a friend.

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
I bit my tongue.

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:47,260
Is your

35
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,080
tongue Trump has

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,120
a family who

37
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I remember everything about your father.

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
I went to Shaozhou County these days.

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
That place was where Chiwang Chuan

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
fell five years ago.

41
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
Actually, Chiwang Chuan

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,160
was entrusted to another demon

43
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,480
to kidnap your father.

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
So if we follow Chiwang Chuan's investigation,

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,840
we should find some clues.

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
Did you find anything?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I found some clues.

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,840
This...

49
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,000
Why does it look like the fish we saw earlier?

50
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Let's go back together.

51
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,880
You're not going to fish?

52
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,760
No.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,680
Let me help you.

54
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,360
Let's go.

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
This young man

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,000
we met in the fish house before.

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,880
Do you remember him?

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,920
Yes.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Banxia, who is this young man?

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,840
He's the Dr. Jiu from the next room next to my neighbor.

61
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,520
You two have a good relationship.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Hello, Dr. Jiu.

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
My name is Xu Zhizhi.

64
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm the dancer of the fish house.

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm Banxia's friend.

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,480
The dancer of the fish house

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
is Banxia's friend.

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Hello, Miss Xu.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,680
Wait a minute.

70
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
All right.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
Don't say anything.

72
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go.

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,960
Xuanyi.

74
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
What's wrong?

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,520
Xuanyi,

76
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,480
are you going to the underground city?

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes.

78
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,240
But your father told you

79
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
not to go to the underground city.

80
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,480
Did you forget?

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,520
I caught a lot of fish today.

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll clean up.

83
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
After you go back,

87
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,360
give this to Dr. Geng.

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,200
Yes.

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,080
Ye He,

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,160
how are you doing in Guangping?

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Your Excellency,

92
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,200
Guangping is a place where people meet.

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,320
The weather is nice.

94
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm doing very well there.

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
You're still young.

96
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,960
You still have a bright future.

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
You can't just do well.

98
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
I heard that you have a lot of work

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,200
to do in Guangping.

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Chen Wenlian is very good at it.

101
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
He has solved a lot of cases.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,560
He values you very much.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,960
You're taking care of me.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,880
I don't dare to bow to you.

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,440
You're from my Dali Temple.

106
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm happy to see

107
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,760
your ability.

108
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
If you hadn't left the capital

109
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,400
that year,

110
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,800
how could you have benefited him?

111
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,960
It's rare for you to come back.

113
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,160
Stay a few more days.

114
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,960
Have a chat with your old friends.

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,160
Remember to go back.

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,800
Yes, Your Excellency.

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,040
I wonder if Brother Chu

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,120
is really back.

119
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,720
Yes.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,720
Father.

121
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,680
Brother Chu,

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,560
they said you were back.

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,360
I didn't believe it.

124
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,920
I didn't expect it to be you.

125
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
Brother Ming and Brother Yue.

126
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,200
Long time no see.

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,360
How long can you stay?

128
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,160
Right.

129
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
Not long.

130
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,920
Too many things to do.

131
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,880
Can't be too long.

132
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,960
Too many things to do?

133
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,440
I don't care.

134
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,240
You belong to me now.

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
How about the lamb soup?

136
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Look.

137
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
Brother Yue knows me well.

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
In Guangping,

139
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,120
I think about

140
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
this bowl of lamb soup day and night.

141
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,600
Why are you standing there?

142
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's go.

143
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,040
Go.

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,920
It's a sunny day.

145
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,400
I have a bunch of official work to do.

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
Are you going back to drink?

147
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,160
Yes, Your Excellency.

148
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
Yes, Your Excellency.

149
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,600
So, it's Brother Chu who is back.

150
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,840
Your Excellency.

151
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,640
When did Brother Chu come back?

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
He's a friend.

153
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
He didn't come to see me when he came back.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
I just came back.

155
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,400
I was busy.

156
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,520
I was busy.

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,360
I just came back.

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,680
I didn't have time to visit you.

159
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,480
I heard you moved to a new house.

160
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, Your Excellency.

161
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
Yes, I do want to move.

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,640
My wife is pregnant.

163
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,040
She's going to give birth soon.

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,320
The small house

165
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
is too small to live in.

166
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,160
I want to

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,200
find a big house near Yanmen

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,520
and move the whole family.

169
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,720
Good.

170
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
It's a good thing.

171
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
Everyone is busy with official work.

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
They haven't been together for a long time.

173
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,880
How about today?

174
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,880
I'll set up a table of wine at Deyuelou.

175
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,560
And call Xun Jiang and the others

176
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,480
to celebrate your move together.

177
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Well...

178
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,520
What?

179
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
What's the matter?

180
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,200
Nothing.

181
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm not busy.

182
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,720
It's settled.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
I'll go and make the reservation now.

184
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
I'll welcome you

185
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,760
at the wedding.

186
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,560
Okay.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,840
If there's nothing else,

188
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,720
come with me.

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,440
I...

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,320
You're welcome.

191
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
We're not going to the wedding today.

192
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,120
It's small and stuffy.

193
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,320
That's great.

194
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,240
I can't see it.

195
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
If you're coming today,

196
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
you can come from the corner.

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,960
That's rare.

198
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
What's so rare?

199
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,400
You're back with the emperor.

200
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Is Deyuelou over?

201
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
Why does it look different from before?

202
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,520
How many people have you been to?

203
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,600
How many years have you been here?

204
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
Everything has changed.

205
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,440
Brother Zhou,

206
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,840
some things

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
still look the same.

208
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
Come on, Brother Zhou.

209
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,680
Why hasn't Si Ma and Si Zhi come yet?

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,920
They should be here soon.

211
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,320
What are you pretending?

212
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,680
If you come back this time,

213
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,600
don't leave.

214
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,440
The tourists will be worse than us.

215
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't mention Si Ma and Si Zhi's elder brother.

216
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,360
He's the Crown Prince's young master now.

217
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
He's very influential.

218
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,880
His father is a great official

219
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
and a high-ranking official.

220
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,360
And his grandfather

221
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,680
is a great man.

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,600
His mother is the empress dowager's niece.

223
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,360
Brother,

224
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
I think

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,800
whoever says a word for you,

226
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
you'll be the top of the world.

227
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
You'll be the top of the world.

228
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,840
Wait.

229
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,160
Did you hear what I said to you?

230
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,960
It's a waste of time.

231
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,400
If he had listened to you,

232
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
he wouldn't have gone to Guangping.

233
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,440
He would have been the son-in-law of Si Ma.

234
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,960
He's just a blind man.

235
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
Si Ma and Si Zhi have been very generous

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,680
in their lives.

237
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,000
They have a bright future.

238
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,000
But he...

239
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,800
He and he have suffered a lot.

240
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,560
You see...

241
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,640
The people who wanted to marry him

242
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
have split up

243
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,720
and changed their minds, right?

244
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,240
If you want to be the top,

245
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
why don't you go?

246
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
You think I don't want to?

247
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,640
The problem is

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,320
they have to be able to look up to me.

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,520
You're so good at talking.

250
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,400
You...

251
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,200
You're why you look so good.

252
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Yang.

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,320
Enough.

254
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Tuan.

255
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,040
He looks at you and feels up to you.

256
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,840
He's dreaming.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,080
What are they so happy about?

258
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,160
Si Zhi.

259
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,640
Si Zhi.

260
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
Less talking about a word.

261
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,480
Stop being so hectic.

262
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Sit down.

263
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,400
So you want to get drunk?

264
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,760
Deng!

265
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,600
Deng.

266
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,200
Deng.

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,640
Meng.

268
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,520
Deng.

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,520
Let's eat.

270
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
If you say something, it's none of your business

271
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,360
That's right

272
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,760
It's rare for a man to say something

273
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,960
and leave without a word

274
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Yes, yes, yes

275
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Here

276
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
This first cup

277
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
is for Your Majesty

278
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
If it weren't for Your Majesty

279
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,360
this royal family wouldn't exist

280
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,360
and we wouldn't have a great relationship

281
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
To Your Majesty

282
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
This second cup

283
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,360
is for you

284
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,760
As a daughter

285
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
I should have taken care of you

286
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,560
Now that you have a new home

287
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm happy for you too

288
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,560
I haven't moved yet

289
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
But I'll do it as soon as possible

290
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
with your permission

291
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
By then, I'll have to bother you

292
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,360
Cheers

293
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Cheers

294
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Cheers

295
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Cheers

296
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,160
This third cup

297
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,960
is for Chu Butou

298
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,760
I heard that you are very popular in Guangping

299
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
and have a high reputation

300
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,960
That Lord Geng Zheng

301
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,560
is the brother of the Imperial Concubine

302
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
He is young and talented

303
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,960
He will be the future Chu

304
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,760
When Brother Chu left me

305
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
I felt really bad for a few days

306
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,360
I thought I didn't deserve you

307
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,360
I didn't expect you to go to Yingzhu

308
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,960
Good taste

309
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,560
Then I wish Chu Butou a bright future

310
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
and a bright future

311
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
Thank you

312
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
The third cup is ready

313
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
I'll go first

314
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Goodbye

315
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
By the way

316
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,160
You are both Chu Butou's good friends and brothers

317
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,160
You must be close to him

318
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
and have the same personality

319
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,960
I hope that on the day he gets married

320
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,360
he will remember to drink with you

321
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,720
in the form of an autograph

322
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:22,660
and

323
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I dare not.

324
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You dare not?

325
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Chu Bu Tao, you used to be a bastard,

326
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
but you are a person who dares to do what he wants.

327
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,760
How come in the past six years, you have become so hypocritical and old-fashioned?

328
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I don't know when I offended you.

329
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
You don't know?

330
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I don't know.

331
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Six years ago, you went to the capital to break off your engagement in public.

332
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
You left the capital and left me alone,

333
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
becoming a laughing stock of the whole city.

334
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
What kind of engagement is that?

335
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Back then, my brother was robbed by a Han bandit.

336
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,760
I made a vow that whoever saves him will marry whoever he wants.

337
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
If you save him, then you are my husband.

338
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
But I didn't know about it back then.

339
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
My Sima family publicly awarded you with a full-time job.

340
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
How come you don't know?

341
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I just don't know.

342
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,620
I am a

343
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Why would I need you to make a vow?

344
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Why did you reject me?

345
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
I didn't reject you.

346
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Then why did you break off your engagement?

347
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Back then, I didn't know you.

348
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I was kind enough to save your brother.

349
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
But your grandfather took your cousin to my house to force them to get married.

350
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I didn't want to.

351
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Your uncle went to the Dali Temple to find my superior and put pressure on me.

352
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I was forced to leave Shun Du overnight.

353
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
I haven't even told you about this.

354
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
You are still wronged.

355
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Isn't it just a wedding?

356
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Is it worth moving overnight?

357
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Besides, I am a beast.

358
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I don't deserve you.

359
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
It's me who doesn't deserve you.

360
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,760
A man and a woman getting married is a big thing in life.

361
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
First, it's a peace of mind.

362
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Second, the door is open to each other.

363
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Sima's job is a big deal.

364
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
And I was born in the Han family.

365
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Before that, we didn't even meet.

366
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
What kind of illusion do you think we are?

367
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
You are so stubborn.

368
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
My father was also born in the Han family.

369
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
He married my mother and had a harmonious marriage.

370
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Now, he is a great man and has a high position in the court.

371
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Why do you have so many reasons?

372
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
A man is a talented man.

373
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
How can he have my level?

374
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
I don't have any ambitions.

375
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
I can't be a man who is born in the Han family

376
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
and become a man who is born in the Han family.

377
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
I just want to be a good compensator.

378
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
I have a good reason to catch the thief.

379
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
It's good to be a compensator.

380
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I am also a compensator.

381
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
No one wants you to be a man who is rich.

382
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
If I want to be a man who is rich,

383
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
I can go to the royal family and catch the thief.

384
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Why do I need you?

385
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Sima Liming.

386
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Your family is a dangerous one.

387
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
I am just a common man.

388
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
I have different heights.

389
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
How can I live with you?

390
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Sima.

391
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Even if I leave because I am in a hurry

392
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
and I don't have your dignity,

393
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
it has been six years.

394
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Can you stop fighting?

395
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Let's make up.

396
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
You...

397
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Stop!

398
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Are you okay?

399
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Stop!

400
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
What's wrong with you?

401
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Are you okay?

402
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Do you want to hold him?

403
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
What's wrong?

404
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Let go!

405
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Let go!

406
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Let go!

407
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Let go!

408
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Let go!

409
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Xuan Yi.

410
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
I know why you want to go to the underground city.

411
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
There are demons in the underground city.

412
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
You got the relationship between Chiwangchuan and the underground city from Shaozhou Jun.

413
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,760
So you guess that the place where Lu Zuo lost his father lives there.

414
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
So you want to find him.

415
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
But your father doesn't allow you to go.

416
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
I don't have any evidence now.

417
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
It's just a guess.

418
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
The one who can control Chiwangchuan is a demon with a high power.

419
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Why don't you go to the underground city

420
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
if you want to catch a demon like him?

421
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I know there are some demons in the underground city

422
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
who have been practicing for more than a hundred years

423
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
and don't like to go out and walk.

424
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Now is the time of the flood.

425
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
All the roads in and out of the underground city have been flooded.

426
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
We can't go in.

427
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
We can only wait.

428
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
No.

429
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Even if the water is back, you can't go.

430
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Your father said that if you dare to go there,

431
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
he will break your legs.

432
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Miss.

433
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Miss.

434
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Miss, why don't you answer me?

435
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
What is this?

436
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Come here.

437
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Don't move.

438
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
What is this?

439
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
So precious.

440
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
This is Dr. Jiu's medicine.

441
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
He gave me this as a gift.

442
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
It's just a paper crane.

443
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Why did he give you this?

444
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
How would I know?

445
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,760
But I just guessed it wrong.

446
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Then what did you guess?

447
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
I don't know.

448
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Don't the ancients like birds and birds?

449
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Think about it.

450
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
The official residence in the capital,

451
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Yanyan and Yuanyang,

452
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
are all official residence.

453
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,760
The official residence is in the middle of the river.

454
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,760
The official residence is in the middle of the river.

455
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
And...

456
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
And...

457
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Yanyan and Yuanyang...

458
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Miss, I understand.

459
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
What do you understand?

460
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,760
I understand what you want me to understand.

461
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
What do I want you to understand?

462
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
You just want me to say that

463
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
the paper crane that Dr. Jiu gave you

464
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,760
is a gift of friendship, trust and love.

465
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
I didn't say that.

466
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,760
I don't think he meant that.

467
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,760
I think you wish he meant that.

468
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Miss, you're done.

469
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
This time,

470
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,760
I noticed when you came back from the group inn.

471
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Your heart was completely

472
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
on Dr. Jiu.

473
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
If it weren't for the lord's indecision,

474
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
you would have already broken the wall

475
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
and moved into my house.

476
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

477
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
I don't think so.

478
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
You've already made it so obvious.

479
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Even the blind can see it.

480
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Miss, there's a word on the paper.

481
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Dr. Jiu wrote you a letter.

482
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
A letter?

483
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Tang Ruyun?

484
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
My mother?

485
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Tang Ruyun is your mother?

486
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Are you sure that this letter was written by your mother?

487
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
That's right.

488
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
I recognize my mother's handwriting.

489
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,760
But my mother passed away 12 years ago.

490
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
I was abducted that year.

491
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
I could see the demon after I came back.

492
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
My parents thought I was infected with some disease.

493
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
So they took me to the capital to seek medical help.

494
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
There was a storm on the road.

495
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
My mother fell into the water.

496
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
I don't know why.

497
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
We all thought she was dead.

498
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
But look.

499
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
This is written as the year of the human being.

500
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Isn't that three years ago?

501
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Is my mother still alive?

502
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Could it be written as the year of the human being?

503
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,760
The year of the human being is 63 years ago.

504
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Her mother was not born yet.

505
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
It must be.

506
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
My mother is still alive.

507
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
No wonder.

508
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Three years ago,

509
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
my father sold a few shops.

510
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
He was not home for most of the year.

511
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I thought he was out on the mountain.

512
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,760
I didn't think he went to see my mother.

513
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
But I don't understand.

514
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Why is this letter in the front box of the cat demon?

515
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
The cat demon died for your father.

516
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
He took your father's money.

517
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,760
He gave me all the money he had taken.

518
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Maybe this letter came from your father.

519
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,760
I put it in the front box.

520
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
My mother is still alive.

521
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Is it related to my father's disappearance?

522
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
It says the cat demon's house.

523
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
My mother wrote this letter.

524
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Can we find the cat demon's house?

525
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
I don't know about the cat demon's house.

526
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,760
But I know the sign of the cat demon.

527
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Cat demon.

528
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Do you know it?

529
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
This is the sign of Guangping underground city.

530
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
You've been to Guangping for a long time.

531
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Don't you know?

532
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
I've only heard of it.

533
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
But I've never been there.

534
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
I've never been there.

535
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
This is the pass of the underground city.

536
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,760
The cat demon's house is in Guangping underground city.

537
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Rumor has it that there's a cat demon's house in the underground city.

538
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,760
The merchants there use the cat demon as a lamp.

539
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,760
And the roof is used to summon the cat demon to make a deal.

540
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,760
As far as I know, the cat demon has become the symbol of the underground city.

541
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Have you been to the underground city?

542
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Yes.

543
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Two years ago, the king of Xianan disappeared.

544
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
I went there to look for him.

545
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,760
So it seems that the cat demon came out of the underground city.

546
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,760
You seem not surprised that there's a cat demon in this world.

547
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
The underground city is full of evil.

548
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Do you really think that only Guangping has the cat demon?

549
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,760
There's a cat demon in the world.

550
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
It's not surprising.

551
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Where are you going?

552
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Pack my luggage and get ready to go.

553
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
No hurry. Come with me to my house.

554
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Your house?

555
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Yes. My mother wants to see you.

556
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Why does your mother want to see me?

557
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
How would I know?

558
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
You can ask her when you get there.

559
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
No.

560
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
How dare you!

561
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,760
You can't disobey your elders' orders.

562
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm telling you, Chu You Huang.

563
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
You're embarrassing me.

564
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
If you do that to my mother,

565
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
guess what?

566
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Can you still see the sun tomorrow?

567
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,760
My mother dares to throw tea in the hall.

568
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,760
You're using your mother to pressure me again.

569
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Go back and change your clothes and wash up.

570
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,760
I'll call someone to pick you up at the inn.

571
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Miss, I need to talk to you.

572
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Anxia, I'll go with you to the underground city.

573
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
You can't go at night.

574
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
What happened?

575
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Her father said she can't go to the underground city.

576
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Why?

577
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,760
The underground city...

578
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I don't know.

579
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Her father said she can't go to the underground city.

580
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Miss, what should we do now?

581
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,760
What kind of bad rules did Dr. Jiu's father set?

582
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Why didn't he let her go to the underground city?

583
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
There must be another reason.

584
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,760
What reason?

585
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Anyway, we have to make two plans.

586
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,760
We'll go to the underground city.

587
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Anyway, we have to make two plans.

588
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,760
The rules were set by her father.

589
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
It's not good for her to go against it.

590
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,760
We can't let her go against her parents because of our own business.

591
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
But now we have new clues.

592
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
I have to go to the underground city no matter what.

593
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,760
But I heard that there are not only demons in there.

594
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,760
There are also some business that can't be done.

595
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,760
It's hard to tell the difference between good and bad.

596
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,760
We might not be able to stop it.

597
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
We have to think of another way.

598
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,760
What other way?

599
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
The way of the master.

600
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Or the way of the master like Xuan Yan.

601
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,760
But the empty-headed priest was dead last time.

602
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Where did he go to find the new one?

603
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
We'll go there ourselves if we can't find it.

604
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Anyway, we'll set off as soon as the water comes back.

605
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Fruits!

606
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Fruits with big and fragrant fruits!

607
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Fruits!

608
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Fruits with big and fragrant fruits!

609
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Fruits!

610
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Take care.

611
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Sir, can I try this?

612
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Of course.

613
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Sir, please wait.

614
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I'll get you some milk.

615
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Sir, please try it before you buy it.

616
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Sir, I'll take both of these.

617
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Okay.

618
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Thank you, sir.

619
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Fruits!

620
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Fruits!

621
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Master.

622
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Sir, your nuts are ready.

623
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Thank you.

624
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Take care.

625
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Fruits!

626
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Fruits with big and fragrant fruits!

627
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
What are you doing?

628
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Come on!

629
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Xiao Xue.

630
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
What happened?

631
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Did you fight with someone?

632
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
No, they hit me first.

633
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Who are they?

634
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
I don't know.

635
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Who?

636
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Is it the Demon Seeker or the people of Jianghu?

637
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
I don't know.

638
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
It's okay.

639
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
They won't catch me anyway.

640
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
I'll go wash my hands.

641
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
You're the shopkeeper?

642
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Are you here to see a doctor or to get medicine?

643
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm not sick.

644
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Oh.

645
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
So you're here to get medicine?

646
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
No.

647
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
I'm here to get medicine.

648
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Xiao Xue!

649
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Xiao Xue!

650
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Xiao Xue!

651
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Xiao Xue!

652
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Xiao Xue!

653
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Xiao Xue!

654
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Xiao Xue!

655
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Xiao Xue!

656
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Xiao Xue!

657
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Xiao Xue!

658
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Xiao Xue!

659
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Please wait!

660
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Please wait!

661
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Please wait!

662
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
It seems we've been too reckless.

663
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
We thought the shop was occupied by demons.

664
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
But we met a master of the Eight Shards.

665
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
I'm Jiang Shang Yu.

666
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
This is my disciple Xue Qiao.

667
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
He's also an important person.

668
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Please have a seat.

669
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
I've heard that the Eight Shards have a spell of pre-demon.

670
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,760
The disciples in the sect will use the demon to their advantage.

671
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
It seems that it's really extraordinary.

672
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Xuan Ye, they hit me.

673
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Apologize.

674
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Of course.

675
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
It's just a misunderstanding.

676
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Please don't blame me.

677
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
We'll leave you to it.

678
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
We'll take our leave.

679
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Xuan Ye.

680
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Master, is this all?

681
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
We'll talk when we get back.

682
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
It's hot.

683
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Be careful.

684
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
I'll go get some rope.

685
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Who were those two people?

686
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
They were all demon hunters.

687
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Demon hunters?

688
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,760
They're not like the empty-handed immortals, right?

689
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
I don't think so.

690
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Wait for me.

691
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Wait for me.

692
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
This is for you.

693
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
What is this?

694
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
It's a pass-through pass for the underground city.

695
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Are you going with me?

696
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
Do you have anyone else to choose from?

697
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,760
We'll leave after the water is clear in a few days.

698
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Do you need anything else?

699
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Bring some money.

700
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Xuan Ye, have some soup.

701
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
I'll go back to my room.

702
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
I'll go get some water.

703
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Don't worry.

704
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
I understand.

705
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Chi Xue.

706
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,760
You told me that he would pay a price for using the Dragon Pillar.

707
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
He was so greedy that he lost his money.

708
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,760
He used the Li Fire Mirror in the Tuenen Inn.

709
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
What is the purpose of the Li Fire Mirror?

710
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
It's used to make a birthday wish.

711
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
What do you mean?

712
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
It's a life-saving device.

713
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
It's short if you use it once.

714
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,760
If you use it often, your hair will get whiter.

715
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Come in.

716
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Why are you here?

717
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
To dye your hair.

718
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
It's okay. Just pull it out.

719
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
There's too much hair. It won't come out clean.

720
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Then keep it.

721
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Didn't I tell you last time?

722
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
People with gray hair don't look energetic.

723
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Are you busy?

724
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm not.

725
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
I'm just here to help.

726
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
No.

727
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Then dye your hair.

728
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
What's wrong?

729
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Did Chi Xue tell you something?

730
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
No.

731
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Don't worry about the underground city.

732
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
My father didn't let me go.

733
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
It's because of my parents' love for my son.

734
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
He's afraid that I'll be in danger.

735
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
But I'm not afraid of him.

736
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
I'm just worried about Chi Xue.

737
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
I'm worried about Chi Xue.

738
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
I'm afraid of my father's love for my son.

739
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
He's afraid that I'll be in danger.

740
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
But I'm always the one to choose.

741
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
If I'm afraid of danger,

742
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
I'd rather be a doctor and let go of this sword.

743
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Maybe your father has another reason.

744
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
What other reason?

745
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
Anyway, this is my business.

746
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Don't mind it.

747
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
You're bald

748
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
because you used the sword.

749
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
I think

750
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
he's not a good sword.

751
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,760
It's not only your body

752
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
but also your life.

753
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
It's better than dying.

754
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
If we didn't have the Dragon Boar that day,

755
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
we might not be able to leave the group.

756
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Don't go.

757
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
You know that I can't pay the price.

758
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
Why do you risk your life?

759
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
What if I don't go?

760
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
How can you save your brother?

761
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,760
How can you get your father's whereabouts from Mao Yao?

762
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
It's my business.

763
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
It has nothing to do with you.

764
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
I'm sorry.

765
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Why are you crying?

766
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Who's crying?

767
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Sit down.

768
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760
I'll comb your hair.

769
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
What's wrong with you?

770
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
You think I'm not good.

771
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,760
I've been involved since I appeared.

772
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
If it weren't for me,

773
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,760
you wouldn't have been so hurt

774
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
and so tired.

775
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
You wouldn't have...

776
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
It's all because of me.

777
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
It has nothing to do with you.

778
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
I'm the mastermind.

779
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
It's not you, but someone else.

780
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
I'm the mastermind.

781
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Don't move.

782
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Your face is dirty.

783
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
I know.

784
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Don't think too much.

785
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
It has nothing to do with you.

786
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
You choose your own path.

787
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Don't blame everything on yourself.

788
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,760
You're young.

789
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
It's not easy to come to Guangping to find your father.

790
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm doing whatever I can to help you.

791
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
I can't wipe it off.

792
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
What can't you wipe off?

793
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
I can't wipe it off.

794
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
I can't wipe it off.

795
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760

The moon is shining bright

891

No need to say much, I'm smiling

892

I'm willing to be with you

My heart is beating fast

894

Ten minutes of love, three minutes of love

895
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
I'm willing to meet you

896
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,760

I just hope to be with you

898
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,760

899

Suddenly I see you by my side

900
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,760
Thank you for watching!
