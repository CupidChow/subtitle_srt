1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Is this true?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The picture in the back is Ahhlsuke.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, I also drew him called Ahhlsuke.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,600
He seems to be a

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,180
I'm going to make a

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,320
little bit of a

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,240
little bit of a

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,920
little bit of a

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,720
little bit of a

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,620
little bit of a

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,620
little bit of a

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,620
little bit of a

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,620
little bit of a

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,620
little bit of a

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,620
little bit of a

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,620
little bit of a

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,640
little bit of a

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
little bit of a

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
little bit of a

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
little bit of a

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,640
little bit of a

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
little bit of a

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
little bit of a

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
little bit of a

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,640
little bit of a

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
little bit of a

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
little bit of a

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
little bit of a

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
little bit of a

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,640
little bit of a

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
little bit of a

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
little bit of a

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
little bit of a

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
little bit of a

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
little bit of a

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
little bit of a

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
little bit of a

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:51,640
little bit of a

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,640
The night in the mountains is really quiet.

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
I can't even hear the dog barking.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,640
The scene in the mountains is like this.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
I don't like the scene.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
I like the fun.

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
The more people, the better.

45
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Since I can see the demon,

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
I don't like to be alone.

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
I always feel very nervous.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
You said the mirror can turn into a demon.

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Then the table and the board can all be demons.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Demons are not so common.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
You don't have to worry about me.

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I won't move.

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
I'm not afraid.

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
The demon is a person.

55
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
There is also a fear.

56
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Even my father will be afraid.

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Otherwise, how can you learn to be a demon?

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm not afraid.

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Then are you afraid?

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
When I was 13 or 14 years old,

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
I was not afraid of anything.

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,640
I always felt a trace on my body.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,640
One day, a tiger came outside the city.

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,640
That tiger killed a lot of people.

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,640
I was bothering my father.

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Let my father take me to get rid of that tiger.

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Did you get rid of it?

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
No.

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,640
That tiger was injured by my father and me.

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
It ran into the cave.

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
We followed it all the way.

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
We found two tigers waiting for it to go back.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,640
My father couldn't bear to let it go.

74
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,640
I was very sad and unhappy at that time.

75
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I was thinking of a tiger skin.

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,640
You smiled?

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
I didn't?

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Continue.

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I went older and became a father,

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,640
and my dad will remember

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
that I will be able to catch the demon

82
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
after a few more days.

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
One time, he went for a split year.

84
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,640
He didn't say anything se Principal Immortal.

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,880
He left half a year after that.

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,640
There was no news at all.

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
When he came back,

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,240
he was seriously injured.

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,640
I only knew then

90
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
what fear was.

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,960
I only knew then

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
why my father

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
let go of that tiger.

94
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,640
Forget it.

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
It's all in the past.

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Now I have four children.

97
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,600
They are all in one body.

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
No one is close to me.

99
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,920
So I don't have any fear.

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,520
You're talking nonsense.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,440
You're not the only one in the family.

102
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,000
You have Tang Chi Xue, Wen Jian,

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,160
and me.

104
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Xue Yi, touch my hand.

105
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Come on.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,280
Hurry up.

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,920
Is my palm very hot?

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
It's the mark you drew for me.

109
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,000
Every time I'm afraid,

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,760
it will heat up.

111
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,200
You didn't hear?

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,680
такое trochę.

113
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,760
How about this?

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,960
Draw an images of yourself.

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,680
I don't need it.

116
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
It's OK.

117
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Right,

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,080
it was you who drew it.

119
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
We nine DO emotions.

120
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,400
We ordinary people

121
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,120
have praised your art of masks.

122
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,720
You can just sleep.

123
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,200
I think you just don't want to talk to me.

124
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,840
You can tell.

125
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
It's true.

126
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,160
I don't want to talk to you either.

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
Why don't you talk?

128
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
I fell asleep.

129
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,280
You fell asleep and you still talk?

130
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,880
I fell asleep right away.

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,000
Hyakuretsu

132
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,320
Legend of the Thunder

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,360
That's why we created this.

134
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,040
You guys really grow up slowly.

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,480
and Palace Manual.

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
They are getting ready bind.

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
What are you doing?

138
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,320
You can't do this.

139
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,400
Okay now

140
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,440
I'll get something,

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,840
Is there anything you want?

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Well!

143
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,680
You can't do this.

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,760
Come here!

145
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
You said,

146
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,860
Hey,

147
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,500
there is a customer.

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,220
Looks quite suitable.

149
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,980
You can borrow the sword and the armor,

150
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,980
but you can't fool people with the sword.

151
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,380
The master's skill is very good.

152
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,820
He hasn't practiced your skills

153
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,980
for more than a decade or two decades.

154
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,300
Good eyes.

155
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,980
Please.

156
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,980
Is it not good?

157
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,180
I knew it wasn't good.

158
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,900
I can't taste it.

159
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,460
So I can't make good food.

160
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,980
You can't taste it?

161
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,060
I...

162
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,460
I can't drink it.

163
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,340
I don't know.

164
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,100
I just want to stop.

165
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
Sister.

166
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
Don't drink it.

167
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,860
I'll let my father

168
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,580
cook a bowl for you later.

169
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,060
It's okay.

170
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,180
It's just a little too strong.

171
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,740
It's not that you can't drink it.

172
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,020
Next time you cook it again,

173
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,340
add less wine and more water.

174
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,780
That's it.

175
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,780
Someone told me that.

176
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,900
But when I cook,

177
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,620
I can't help but add a lot of ingredients.

178
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,060
Maybe it's because I can't taste it.

179
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,220
So I have to satisfy my eyes first.

180
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,660
For the past ten years,

181
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,980
there have been fewer wars in the four seas.

182
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,980
Where did you get the army?

183
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,860
I...

184
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,460
I was a soldier when I was 16.

185
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,180
I've been here for over 30 years.

186
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,340
At that time,

187
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,500
I was so brave.

188
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
There were more people who died than were alive.

189
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,060
My parents...

190
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,380
wanted me to live.

191
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,580
So they let me join the army.

192
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,500
I see.

193
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,060
At first,

194
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,660
I was in the North China Sea for three years.

195
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,340
Then,

196
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,940
I joined the army in the South China Sea.

197
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,780
Then I joined...

198
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,380
I joined the army of General Zhang Guang.

199
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,300
I heard that General Zhang was a good soldier.

200
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,500
All the soldiers in the army

201
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,220
were good at fighting.

202
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
If you could follow General Zhang,

203
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,020
you would be a good soldier.

204
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,060
I'm not good at anything.

205
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm just a soldier.

206
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm just a soldier.

207
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,740
It's not easy for you.

208
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,900
Actually, I was there...

209
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,620
for a short time.

210
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,540
Then General Zhang sent me to the horse shop.

211
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,140
There were many wars there.

212
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,340
I was the only one.

213
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,740
The soldiers were in charge of the army.

214
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,940
Each five years, they were in charge of the army.

215
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,740
Then they could take the soldiers home.

216
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
And then?

217
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,940
Then...

218
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,940
they could live.

219
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,140
There were not many people there.

220
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,940
What were we doing there?

221
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,940
We were just planting trees and planting crops.

222
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,140
The time to change the camp was finally here.

223
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,940
But none of us waited.

224
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,940
After half a year,

225
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,140
the governor brought two of his men

226
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,140
to ask the court.

227
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
But they said...

228
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,540
there was no news.

229
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,740
After a while,

230
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,540
a merchant passed by.

231
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,940
The merchant told us

232
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,140
that the emperor had passed away.

233
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,940
But the prince tried to take the throne.

234
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,540
We were in a very bad situation.

235
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,940
We were in a very bad situation.

236
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
We were in a very bad situation.

237
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,540
What did you do?

238
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,740
What did we do?

239
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,140
The days went by.

240
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,740
It was hard.

241
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,140
Soon, the soldiers started to flee.

242
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,540
Some ran away.

243
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,940
They were caught by the police and were taken away.

244
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,940
But it was useless.

245
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Someone still wanted to escape.

246
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,540
The soldiers were on the edge.

247
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,940
They were sentenced to death for not having a war.

248
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,340
Either they survived,

249
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,740
or they died.

250
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
But he was alone.

251
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,340
How many times could he stop them?

252
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,540
He was so heartbroken that he couldn't stay.

253
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
What about you?

254
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,740
You left too?

255
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,940
Don't mention it.

256
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,540
I was going to leave too.

257
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
I packed my luggage.

258
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,140
But I couldn't leave.

259
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Why?

260
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,140
That little beggar was sick.

261
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,940
He died when I left.

262
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,340
Why did you get up?

263
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,940
Why did you get up?

264
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,940
Drink the medicine first.

265
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,540
Don't touch me.

266
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,740
I can't.

267
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,140
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Let's drink the medicine first.

269
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,940
I know my own health better than myself.

270
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,940
Buddy, where's your flag?

271
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,740
My flag?

272
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,940
It's hanging.

273
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm hanging it for you.

274
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
Don't worry.

275
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,140
You and I are the country's best soldiers.

276
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,740
We're the last survivors of the military.

277
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Yes.

278
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,140
We can't fall!

279
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,140
We can't fall!

280
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,140
It's a pity.

281
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,140
I've been protecting him for half a year.

282
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
He still died.

283
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,340
I've been waiting for this promise for over 20 years.

284
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,540
Later, the emissaries of the court passed by

285
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,940
and reported this to the court.

286
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,940
The court sent someone to take over.

287
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,940
And I...

288
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
I came back.

289
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,540
You've been a soldier for 20 years.

290
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,540
You're a hero, Mr. Zhang.

291
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,340
Smart and brave.

292
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,740
Uncanny heroes.

293
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,540
Brave and brave.

294
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,940
Uncanny heroes.

295
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,540
What does this have to do with me?

296
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,140
The father of the nine states is a hero.

297
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,740
He's simple and brave.

298
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,940
How can a hero be compared to a hero?

299
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
What hero?

300
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,140
I just want to do my job well.

301
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
It's because people like you

302
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,340
can do what you should do well.

303
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
That's why you're famous.

304
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,340
You little brat.

305
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
You're so talkative.

306
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Why don't you do your job well?

307
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,940
You're always wandering in the mountains.

308
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,740
How do you know I'm just enjoying my time

309
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,140
and not doing my job?

310
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,940
You've been abroad for years.

311
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm curious.

312
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,740
Have you ever seen a demon?

313
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
Five Five

314
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,340
There's a pillow missing.

315
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,540
Brother, am I wrong?

316
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,260
I mean, why so many young people are going.

317
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,400
So you are willing to die alone for me.

318
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,480
Youngster, I wiII be giving you a body.

319
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,800
Sister, be Designer gapsing away.

320
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,660
I will wipe it off.

321
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,400
Sister.

322
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Why do we have to split up?

323
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I was cold last night.

324
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm afraid I'll pass it to her.

325
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Why are you hiding it from me?

326
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,400
The most important thing in the past is the same bed and a dream.

327
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
A couple with their own thoughts.

328
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,400
I just didn't think that if you're this young and pretty,

329
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
you wouldn't be pleased by me.

330
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Being a human being is really complicated.

331
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Tong Wu Niang, what kind of person do you want to be in the future?

332
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
I never thought about it.

333
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,400
But now I think that a person like you is really good.

334
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Everyone has different experiences.

335
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,400
How can someone be worse than others?

336
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I also think that it's good that you and your father run a hotel like this.

337
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You can come and see me off.

338
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,400
You can come and see me off.

339
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Tong Wu Niang, how long have you been running this hotel?

340
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
It's been a long time.

341
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
It's been over ten years.

342
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Over ten years?

343
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,400
But you said that this hotel is located in the wilderness.

344
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
It's far from the government office.

345
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Did anything dangerous happen?

346
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,400
My father said that as long as I don't leave the hotel,

347
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
there won't be any danger.

348
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,400
My father also said that the outside world is the most dangerous.

349
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,400
It will cause me to lose my life.

350
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Outside world?

351
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I think that you are also a person who knows how to manage things.

352
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,400
How can you be so ambitious?

353
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,400
To be honest, I really believe that

354
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
there is no such thing as a world without its own.

355
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Maybe there is a demon in the hotel where you live.

356
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I have been running this hotel for many years.

357
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I have never heard anyone say that there is a demon here.

358
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Then would you like to try it?

359
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
How can I try it?

360
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
What is this?

361
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
It doesn't matter what it is.

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
What matters is that it can kill demons.

363
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
What is the danger outside?

364
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
It's a cat.

365
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Every year, there are many people who die in the hands of cats.

366
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Are you talking about cats?

367
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,400
The cats here are big and fierce.

368
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
They are all together.

369
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
They are as strong as a wolf.

370
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
If you meet them,

371
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm afraid that you can't stand it.

372
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
If you say that, the cats are so dangerous.

373
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Aren't you afraid of opening a shop here?

374
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm afraid that you can't stand it.

375
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Aren't you afraid of opening a shop here?

376
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
I'm not afraid.

377
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Why?

378
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Because there is no cat that dares to enter my hotel.

379
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Just this?

380
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Please.

381
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Why are you so sure?

382
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
No matter how fierce the animals are, they are afraid of people.

383
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
There are so many people in our hotel.

384
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
They don't dare to come in.

385
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
It's not hot.

386
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Eat radish.

387
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
It smells so good.

388
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Eat.

389
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Don't be so polite.

390
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Eat this.

391
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Why are you here?

392
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Do you remember the high voice of the horse that hit people?

393
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Chi Xue mentioned it to me.

394
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Although it was beheaded, it didn't die.

395
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Yes.

396
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
I was the one who caught people and chased them all the way here.

397
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Did you catch them?

398
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I caught them. They are dead.

399
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
What happened?

400
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
I found their body in the woods.

401
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
A pair of eyes were dug out.

402
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Their hair was cut off.

403
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Locals say that it was done by a cat.

404
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,400
It's hard to say that a cat can dig out eyes.

405
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
But it's impossible to cut off their hair.

406
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Maybe a cat can't do it.

407
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
But a cat demon can.

408
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Cat demon?

409
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
What cat demon?

410
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Chi Wang Chuan said that my father got help from the cat demon.

411
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,400
We suspect that the cat demon is the cat demon.

412
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Since you are sleeping, why did you come to the hotel?

413
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
We stayed there when we got back.

414
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
We were going to go back the next morning.

415
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
But I found something.

416
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
This is Gao Sheng's hair band.

417
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Are you sure?

418
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
He wore this on the street that day.

419
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
I just thought it looked familiar.

420
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,400
I thought he might have lived here when he escaped.

421
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
So I asked the manager.

422
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
He said he had never seen this person.

423
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,400
I suspected that I would let a man go back to report to you.

424
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I will stay here with another colleague to continue investigating.

425
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
How is it going?

426
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
The manager of this hotel is Feng Tian.

427
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
He has a daughter named Feng Wu Niang.

428
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
The servants here are all weird.

429
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
They like to copy and imitate.

430
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
They seem to be not very smart.

431
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
They always talk in secret.

432
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
As for that manager Feng Tian,

433
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
he is quite strong and has the power to help others.

434
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Since we are talking about the demon,

435
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
do you think he might be the demon?

436
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
He was born in the air force. I have tried.

437
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
He is a human, not a demon.

438
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Born in the air force?

439
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Yes.

440
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
And he is not weak.

441
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Once he moves his hands, he will not be inferior to us.

442
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
He might be a little bit taller.

443
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Don't run!

444
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
What is going on?

445
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
You don't know?

446
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Blood is...

447
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
A demon?

448
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
A demon is raising a demon?

449
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Is it strange?

450
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Wu Niang,

451
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
I have a question.

452
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Wu Niang?

453
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Wu Niang?

454
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Wu Niang?

455
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
You are here.

456
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Wu Niang,

457
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
the guest of Xinzi hospital has been here for half a month.

458
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
If you are done, let him go.

459
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
And the person from Jia Si hospital,

460
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
he has also found me.

461
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
He is a main demon.

462
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
He is very hard to deal with.

463
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
You should stay away from him.

464
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I am talking to you.

465
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Do you hear me?

466
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I am telling you,

467
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
the person from Jia Si hospital is very dangerous.

468
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Don't keep wandering in front of him.

469
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Didn't you say,

470
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
you are a good man,

471
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
you are a good man,

472
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
you have your own life?

473
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
I am not a bad person.

474
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Why do they want to deal with me?

475
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Or you think,

476
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I will ruin your business?

477
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
We are not on the same side.

478
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Stay away from them.

479
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Or you will be in trouble.

480
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
No,

481
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I like the sister from Jia Si hospital.

482
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
I want to get closer to her.

483
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Is it beautiful?

484
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Girl,

485
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,400
can you stop listening to me?

486
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
I am not a girl.

487
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
I am a girl.

488
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I am a girl.

489
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I am a girl.

490
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
I am a girl.

491
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
I am a girl.

492
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
I am a girl.

493
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I am a girl.

494
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I am a girl.

495
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I am a girl.

496
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I am a girl.

497
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I am a girl.

498
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I am a girl.

499
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I am a girl.

500
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
I am a girl.

501
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I am a girl.

502
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I am a girl.

503
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I am a girl.

504
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Here, drink some water.

505
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm fine now.

506
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
What You Huang said is true.

507
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Can a cat demon kill people?

508
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
You think it can't?

509
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I just think it can't.

510
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Don't think too much.

511
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,900
Go to bed early.

512
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
I'm right next door.

513
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
Call me if you need me.

514
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Dad, didn't you say

515
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
that if you do right, you'll be right?

516
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
If you do good, you'll have a life.

517
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
I'm not a bad person.

518
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Why do they want to deal with me?

519
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Who is it?

520
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Who is it?

521
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Shen Ye!

522
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Shen Ye!

523
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
What's wrong?

524
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
What's wrong?

525
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I think I saw a cat demon.

526
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
It's gone.

527
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
It disappeared as soon as it entered this yard.

528
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,020
Could this be its

529
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
hidden agenda?

530
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Since it entered the Taoyuan Inn,

531
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
it seems to have been

532
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
leading us to this place.

533
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Let's look for it again.

534
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
No.

535
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
I don't think so.

536
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,020
I don't think so.

537
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Meow.

538
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,020
Who?

539
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Banxia.

540
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,020
Brother?

541
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
Why are you here?

542
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
We came here to do some things.

543
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Brother, why are you here?

544
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Didn't you go back to Nanyang?

545
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
I found the scenery here

546
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
very nice.

547
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
I happened to have some dandruff

548
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
and was resting here.

549
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Did your family know?

550
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
I went to the library.

551
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
But brother,

552
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
do you know that there is a problem with this inn?

553
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
You're not safe here.

554
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
What's the problem?

555
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
I know that you're good at drinking.

556
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
But the boss here is kind.

557
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,260
There's nothing wrong with going back as soon as possible.

558
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
I'm not that unlucky.

559
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
I can meet the medicine wherever I go.

560
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
What Mr. Duan said is not unreasonable.

561
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
We're just suspecting.

562
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
You haven't slept well these days.

563
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
I see that you look pale.

564
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Your lips are pale.

565
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,260
It seems to be a symptom of weak blood.

566
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,260
It must be the mountain's air.

567
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
It must have hurt your body.

568
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
It's nothing.

569
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
It's just that I've been sleeping outside.

570
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
I can't sleep well.

571
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Anxia.

572
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
How about I give you a pulse

573
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
and prescribe some sedatives?

574
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Although I'm a drug dealer,

575
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
I'm a doctor.

576
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
What? You don't believe me?

577
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
How could I?

578
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
It's just that

579
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I know my own body.

580
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
There's nothing wrong with it.

581
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
I won't bother you.

582
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
It's okay.

583
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
It's getting late.

584
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
If you have anything to say,

585
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
you can say it tomorrow.

586
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
You two should rest early.

587
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Okay.

588
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I'll take Banxia to her room.

589
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Do you think my brother is strange?

590
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
I think so, too.

591
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
And he doesn't want to listen to us.

592
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
He's very resistant.

593
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
He doesn't want to talk to us.

594
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
The most important thing is

595
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
he doesn't care about us

596
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
being alone here.

597
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
He doesn't ask me to take you away.

598
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
It's not like your brother.

599
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
What do you think he is?

600
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
I think he's hiding something.

601
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Hiding?

602
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Did you smell the alcohol on him?

603
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I smelled a little bit.

604
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
It's just that the smell of the incense

605
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
in the room is too strong.

606
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
It covered the smell.

607
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
But my brother

608
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
has a habit of drinking alcohol.

609
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Don't worry.

610
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
He lives in the inn now.

611
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
We'll take care of him.

612
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
There won't be any danger.

613
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Let's go back first.

614
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Okay.

615
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
You still can't rest assured about your brother?

616
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
I understand what you said.

617
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
But I still don't understand.

618
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
My brother has always been

619
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
a man of character but also of courage.

620
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
I don't understand why he became like this.

621
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
My father's whereabouts are unknown.

622
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Although there is a clue

623
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
about the cat demon,

624
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
I still don't know where he was caught.

625
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Now even my brother is trapped.

626
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
Why does this always

627
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,740
happen to my family?

628
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
First, I can see the demon.

629
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Then my brother fell in love with the demon.

630
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,740
Even my father was kidnapped by the demon.

631
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
I often think

632
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
if all this bad luck

633
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,740
is because of me.

634
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Because I can see the demon with my eyes,

635
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
so they will be chased

636
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
and killed by the demon.

637
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
And every time it's in front of me

638
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
but I can't do anything.

639
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
You've done a good job.

640
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
I remember when you

641
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
first met Man Niang and Chi Wang Chuan,

642
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
you were so panic.

643
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Now you can face it calmly.

644
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Just like today,

645
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
the cat demon suddenly appeared.

646
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
You chased it without hesitation.

647
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
There was no hesitation.

648
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
I'm afraid that

649
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
no one will do better than you.

650
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Man Xia, you are very brave.

651
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
But if I was more brave

652
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
and more careful,

653
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
would I have found out

654
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
my father's intention that day?

655
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Knowing that Chi Wang Chuan was in his room,

656
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
all this wouldn't have happened.

657
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
We are all ordinary people.

658
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
You don't have the ability to know.

659
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
You don't have to feel guilty

660
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
or blame yourself for your actions.

661
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
It's not your fault.

662
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
The more you do this,

663
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
the more firm you must be.

664
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Don't be sad.

665
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm not sad.

666
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I saw something in my eyes.

667
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
You saw something?

668
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Let me see.

669
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Where?

670
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
Right eye.

671
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
This eye?

672
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Do you feel better?

673
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
If you see something in your eyes,

674
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
or ask someone else for help,

675
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
you can't rub it with your hand.

676
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Your eyes will be hurt.

677
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I know, Dr. Jiu.

678
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
You're still laughing?

679
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Do you remember?

680
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
I remember.

681
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
I can laugh even if I remember.

682
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Man Xia, are you asleep?

683
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
I'm asleep.

684
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,460
Where did you go?

685
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,460
I went to catch the cat demon.

686
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
I wanted to block it from the small road.

687
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
But the inn is too big. I'm lost.

688
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,460
You...

689
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,460
What are you doing?

690
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,460
I want to know

691
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,460
if you kissed Man Xia.

692
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
Who kissed Man Xia?

693
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,460
If you don't tell me,

694
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,460
I'll sleep tonight.

695
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Stop talking nonsense.

696
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
I saw it.

697
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
You and Tan were sitting there.

698
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
And then...

699
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
We were sitting there

700
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
because there was sand in his eyes.

701
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
I blew it for him.

702
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
Don't lie to me.

703
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
My eyes have already seen you clearly.

704
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Really?

705
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Tell me.

706
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
I'll listen.

707
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
I can't tell.

708
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Anyway, you saw Man Xia.

709
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
Your father saw your mother.

710
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
Your brother saw Miss Wang.

711
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
They're the same.

712
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Manager, there's a mouse in our room.

713
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Mouse?

714
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Yes.

715
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
How could there be a mouse?

716
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
It's true.

717
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
I'll go to the inn.

718
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
I'll go to the inn.

719
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
I'll go to the inn.

720
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
I'll go to the inn.

721
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
I'll go to the inn.

722
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
I'll go to the inn.

723
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
I'll go to the inn.

724
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
I'll go to the inn.

725
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
I'll go to the inn.

726
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
I'll go to the inn.

727
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,700
I'll go to the inn.

728
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
I'll go to the inn.

729
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
I'll go to the inn.

730
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
I'll go to the inn.

731
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,700
I'll go to the inn.

732
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Everybody, stop.

733
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Please leave.

734
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Sister Duan

735
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
What are you guys doing?

736
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Dancing?

737
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It's all in vain.

738
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
We're playing around.

739
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,440
You look laying nice today.

740
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,440
The mountain is quiet, I'm resting well.

741
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,240
I heard that last night, there was a big noise at the Jiazi Garden.

742
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,440
I didn't disturb you, right?

743
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,240
You heard it?

744
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,240
It was just a mountain cat.

745
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I brought some snacks from Guangming, there's not much left, try some.

746
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,240
You forgot that I can't taste anything.

747
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,240
Even if you can't taste anything, you should eat well.

748
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,240
I want to take these good snacks home and eat them with my father.

749
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Wuniang, let me ask you something.

750
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,240
You said that this inn is being repaired, only we can stay here.

751
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,240
But I saw that there's also a guest who lives here.

752
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Really?

753
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Yes, there is a guest.

754
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,240
A young young man.

755
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Since he came, he never left the inn.

756
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,240
I haven't seen him, so I...

757
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
I forgot about him.

758
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
You forgot?

759
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,240
There are always some strange guests.

760
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,240
They don't want to stay at home because of this or that reason.

761
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,240
They want to come to this mountain where the smell of incense is so strong.

762
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,240
I don't know what they are hiding from.

763
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Sister, why did you suddenly ask about him?

764
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Do you know him?

765
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,240
He is my older brother.

766
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Really?

767
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,240
But you don't look like him at all.

768
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,240
You are more handsome.

769
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,240
You are so lucky.

770
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,240
You have a husband and an older brother.

771
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Unlike me, I only have my father.

772
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,240
My brother has been gone for a long time.

773
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,240
You have a brother?

774
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,240
My brother ran away.

775
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,240
One day, I will also run away.

776
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Sister, can I go to your house and find you?

777
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,240
