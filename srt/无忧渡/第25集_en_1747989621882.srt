00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A look of excitement at a super-high-endail Não-ão-이들

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,420
How much is this?

16
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,420
It seems like a mouth

17
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,420
I know, it's a liver

18
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
It seems like a little mountain

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,420
I know it's a mountain

20
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Gan Shan Tang

21
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,420
Gan Shan Tang?

22
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,420
Where is Gan Shan Tang?

23
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,420
Shendu

24
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,420
Shendu City?

Xun Yan

26
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm hungry

Shun Yi

28
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,420
Why are you drinking alone?

29
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,420
You're in a bad mood

30
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,420
Come

31
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,420
I won't drink anymore

32
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,420
I'll go back to the Ya Men later

33
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,420
I'll talk to you

34
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,420
I'm in a bad mood recently

35
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,420
What?

36
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,420
Si Ma Ling left?

37
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,420
You don't want to?

38
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Him?

39
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,420
I want him to leave earlier

40
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,420
You two are in a good mood

41
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,420
There's no one

42
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
There's nothing to block you

43
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,420
You should cherish such fate

44
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,420
If you really like him

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Don't always say those hurtful words

46
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,420
Don't wait for him to be heartbroken

47
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,420
You can't even regret it

48
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,420
Where did you see that I like him?

49
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,420
I'm not in the same team with the four masters

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,420
How could I like him?

51
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
You're in the game

52
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Unintentional

53
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,420
You mean

54
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
I don't know who I like

55
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,420
You're more familiar with the people in the game

56
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
I know who I like

57
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
You don't like him?

58
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,420
I don't want to talk about this

59
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Here

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,420
Do you remember

61
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Chu Tou

64
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Chen Mei is a police officer

65
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
She's been in the police station for a long time

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,720
Push harder

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,420
We're in a fit of competition

71
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
You know

72
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Sir

73
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
What's happening?

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,300
Stop playing

75
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,220

I have to go now.

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm leaving.

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Bye-bye.

86
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Bye-bye.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Bye-bye.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Bye.

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Bye-bye.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Bye-bye.

91
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
You're still looking for her?

92
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
I still can't find her.

93
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,120
It's so hard.

94
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
My parents are here too.

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
I don't have space in my house at home.

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,120
The house now is not too cheap, it's too poor, or too expensive.

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,120
You say that this big Guangping city has so many houses, are they all living here?

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
There's no one who can afford to rent it to me?

99
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm young and I work hard to earn money.

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
How can I even afford a house?

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,120
It's just that I don't have much to do these days. I'll go with you to look for it.

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I'll go with you.

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
You go too.

105
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
No, no.

106
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,120
I said that I don't want to work, so the chef told me to eat less.

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I'll go with you to eat.

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Okay.

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Miss, where are you going?

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Miss!

111
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
The deceased Zhang Pu was 40 years old.

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
In the early years, he spent some money on buying a firm.

113
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
He's a good man, he's kind and generous, but he's a miner.

114
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
He's a good man, but he's a miner.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,120
He's been a miner for half a year, but he's never seen anyone like him.

116
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
No one's looking for him?

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,120
A firm is a job, it's to help the officials.

118
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
He only has money to buy a firm.

119
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
His superior knows what he's doing.

120
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,120
He's looking for someone, but he's not.

121
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Where's his family?

122
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,120
He's a family member, he's a father and a father.

123
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
He has a wife named Xingsian, she lives here.

124
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
You're here.

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
You don't have to come here.

126
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
There's nothing to do today.

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
You go with me.

128
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Who's this?

129
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
She's Mrs. Zhang Pu.

130
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Yes.

131
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Good day.

132
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
My lord.

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Do you know where your husband is?

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
What do you mean?

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
My husband hasn't been back for half a year.

136
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Why didn't he come home?

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Why didn't he come home?

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Well, my husband has been out for a long time.

139
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
He's been out for a long time.

140
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,120
He's been out for three or five months.

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
He's been out for a long time.

142
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,120
My lord, did something happen?

143
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
He's dead.

144
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
He's dead?

145
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
He's dead?

146
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
He's dead?

147
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Zhang Bei is not a man.

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
He's drunk all day.

149
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
He's drunk too much.

150
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
He's only afraid of his wife.

151
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I've told you before.

152
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
If he's dead,

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
he'll have to drink to death.

154
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Did I ask you?

155
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Xingsian, you must hold on.

156
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
My lady,

157
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
take the body away from the gate

158
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
and bring the body.

159
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Yes, my lady.

160
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Come with me.

161
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Xingsian.

162
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
There are many wounds on the body.

163
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
And it's a new wound.

164
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
The condition of the clothes is

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
the one that's being treated.

166
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
The neck is broken.

167
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
It seems that there's no sign of it.

168
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Really?

169
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
My lady,

170
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
the only wound on the body

171
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
is the neck.

172
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
It's the neck that's broken

173
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
on the road on the day of the celebration.

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
What's wrong?

175
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Is he dead?

176
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Fan Xia,

177
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
do you know anyone?

178
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I don't know.

179
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I don't know why I followed him.

180
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I think...

181
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
I think I know who's going to die.

182
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
My lady,

183
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
did you see the white fog again?

184
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
What white fog?

185
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm so excited.

186
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I want to tell you a story.

187
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
No.

188
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
No.

189
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Fan Xia,

190
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
I saw the white fog

191
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
on Lu Sanlang's body.

192
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Did he really die?

193
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I just need to remind him.

194
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
But I...

195
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
I just don't know

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
I...

197
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Ban Xia, don't be sad.

198
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
It's not your fault.

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,120
If you are sad because of this,

200
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,120
it's not the cure for the demon.

201
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Yes.

202
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
We all know you are kind.

203
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
But the world is so vast.

204
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
People die because of accidents.

205
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
You can't blame all the criminals on your own.

206
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Yes, Ban Xia.

207
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
You saved my life because of Bai Wuyiang.

208
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
It's getting late.

209
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
You should go home and rest.

210
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm going to the private room to do something.

211
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
I'll go with them.

212
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Who are you going to be alone today?

213
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
You don't know how to fill the cup.

214
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
I know how to.

215
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,120
But I'm afraid I'll fill the cup again.

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
You will be in trouble tomorrow.

217
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble.

218
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm not good at it.

219
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm not good at it.

220
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
I'll leave it to you.

221
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I got it.

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Xuan Yi, what's the name of that person?

223
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Is there any new name at home?

224
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
I'm still thinking about that.

225
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
What's wrong?

226
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Are they...

227
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
What?

228
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
That person?

229
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
You're right.

230
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm not sure about Dr. Jiu.

231
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,120
But my sister-in-law likes him.

232
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Just say it.

233
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I don't think it's right.

234
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Dr. Jiu.

235
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm not trying to interrupt you.

236
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
It's just that it's late.

237
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm a little hungry.

238
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
How about we eat together?

239
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
You're eating again?

240
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Are you hungry?

241
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
You're not hungry?

242
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
How can you lose weight?

243
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
That's a good one.

244
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Let's go then.

245
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm a little tired.

246
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
You go ahead. I won't go.

247
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
No!

248
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Three pretty girls will eat with you.

249
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
You have to go if you're tired.

250
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,120
You go ahead. I'll go back first.

251
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
It's hard to be a doctor.

252
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
You're right.

253
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
I'll say it.

254
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
You're hungry?

255
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Why are you still eating?

256
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
What's wrong?

257
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
You're always so alert.

258
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
It's obvious.

259
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm not.

260
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I'm not.

261
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm not.

262
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
What's wrong?

263
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
Sit.

264
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,120
There's something that makes me very sleepy.

265
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
I don't know who to tell you.

266
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Me?

267
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,120
Ever since the world came out,

268
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,120
I've always dreamed of being a doctor.

269
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,120
In the painting, I'm the line of Guangbin Manor.

270
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
My parents are here.

271
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm even married.

272
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Do you know who my wife is?

273
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Who?

274
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
A scumbag.

275
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Don't laugh.

276
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
It's not a painting.

277
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
It's a painting.

278
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,120
I found that I can't get out of the painting.

279
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,120
And I'm not sure if I can tell you the same feeling as me.

280
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Every time I see you,

281
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
I feel weird.

282
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
That's what I think.

283
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,120
I think the painting is the demon.

284
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
It's fake.

285
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
And I think it's normal to see you in the middle.

286
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Really?

287
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
You Hua,

288
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
you can't tell that you like Xuan Ye, right?

289
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
You like Xuan Ye in the middle?

290
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
How is that possible?

291
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,120
You Hua, it's you.

292
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
We all can tell.

293
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,120
And I think Xuan Ye likes Ban Xia in the middle.

294
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Which woman do you think Xuan Ye is so considerate?

295
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
You Hua,

296
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,120
as a person who comes to see you,

297
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
I cherish the past.

298
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
No.

299
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
A person who comes to see you.

300
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Duan Bu Fu, you can't do that.

301
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I have something to ask you.

302
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
You can get up first.

303
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I'm sorry for your life.

304
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
I'm the only one who can save my family.

305
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm willing to repay you in any way.

306
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,120
I'll do my best to save you.

307
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,120
I'll do my best to save you.

308
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
I'll do my best to save you.

309
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
But,

310
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
if you can repay me in the middle,

311
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
I can't do it.

312
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Dr. Jiu, you are so considerate.

313
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,120
You have the initiative to write.

314
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
You can write.

315
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
You are rich and rich,

316
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
but you have the ability to do it.

317
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,120
You are so considerate.

318
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,120
I'm the only one who can save your family.

319
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,120
I can't do anything

320
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
even if I choose to do it.

321
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
But,

322
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
there is one thing.

323
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
You are a important person.

324
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm not willing to do anything

325
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
but write to you.

326
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm willing to do it.

327
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
What is written on it?

328
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Shangjing City.

329
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Shangjing City?

330
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Isn't it Shendu City?

331
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Shangjing City is Shendu City.

332
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Are you a foreigner?

333
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Yes.

334
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
My legs.

335
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
You want to leave after hitting someone?

336
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,120
I can't leave without money.

337
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
What?

338
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Shake.

339
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Do you know Man Ying?

340
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
I don't know.

341
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Do you know Man Ying?

342
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,120
I don't know her.

343
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
You are looking for her?

344
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Yes.

345
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Do you know Man Ying?

346
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I don't know her.

347
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Are you looking for her?

348
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Do you know where Man Ying is?

349
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Of course I know.

350
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Come with me.

351
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Where is she?

352
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Inside.

353
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Where is she?

354
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,120
How dare you break Shangjing City?

355
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Where did you get this?

356
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Nonsense.

357
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
What are you doing?

358
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Chase.

359
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Yes.

360
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Help.

361
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Is there anyone?

362
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Don't come over.

363
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Help.

364
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Don't come over.

365
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Where did the man from the wilderness come from?

366
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
It's a pity.

367
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
It's a pity.

368
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,120
I heard that Gao Sen has become a good man.

369
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Maybe he is almost the same.

370
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
It's a pity that I don't have a good fortune.

371
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
I wasted my good life.

372
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Gu Zao, what are you talking about?

373
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Look at these skin.

374
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
They look fierce.

375
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
But they are also skin-packed.

376
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
They are not good.

377
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,120
They are suffering from heavy life.

378
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Brothers,

379
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
can you discuss

380
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
if we can keep one of our lives?

381
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
How about this?

382
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
We two

383
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
leave all the dry food to you.

384
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
When we return to the city,

385
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,120
we will exchange the good meat.

386
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,120
If we still have enough sincerity,

387
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,120
we can leave the car and ride a horse.

388
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
How about this?

389
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
They think it's okay.

390
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Let's leave it to the poor.

391
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
I can't bear it anymore.

392
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Let's leave it to the poor.

393
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Be careful, brothers.

394
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Don't enter them.

395
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Come on.

396
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
It's okay.

397
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
You are leaving?

398
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,120
You really are leaving?

399
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I...

400
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I am Li Xian.

401
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I am from the Li Dynasty.

402
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
I am from the Yanzhou people's clan.

403
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
My father is from the Yanzhou family.

404
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
My brother is from the three of us.

405
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
My brothers are helping my father to deal with the affairs.

406
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
I am from the Yanzhou family.

407
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
I am the head of the Li Qiku family.

408
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
My brothers are married.

409
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
I have a marriage that I have already settled.

410
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,120
I am going to Yanzhou to play in the wedding.

411
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I have introduced myself.

412
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
I want to know how to address you.

413
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
Do you have a marriage in your family?

414
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
My name is Jiuxuan Ye.

415
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
I am from the second family.

416
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I am from the second family.

417
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
I don't know where my brother lives.

418
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Why is he living in the wilderness alone?

419
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
I live in Guangping City.

420
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Guangping?

421
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Isn't that a great fate?

422
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
My fiancee lives in Guangping City.

423
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
We are going to pick him up.

424
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
If you are willing to go home together,

425
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
why don't you come with us?

426
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,120
How far is Guangping City from here?

427
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
It's far.

428
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Mr. Huai, this is Tanzhou Bridge.

429
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
The most important thing is that it is in the city of Tanzhou.

430
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,120
There are about three days of road trip to Guangping City.

431
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Banxiang.

432
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Where is he?

433
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
I don't know.

434
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
I didn't see him since I woke up this morning.

435
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Banxiang.

436
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Dad.

437
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
You are going to the next door.

438
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
But Mr. Xuan Ye is not at home.

439
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
If there is nothing, I will go back to my room.

440
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
It's over.

441
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Banxiang.

442
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Don't be busy.

443
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Just eat something.

444
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
The tofu koukou you made is so good.

445
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
It's not as good as the noodles.

446
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Aren't you going to eat it, Banxiang?

447
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Banxiang.

448
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
What's wrong?

449
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Are you not in the dark?

450
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
No.

451
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Is it for your good neighbor?

452
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
He left the door this morning.

453
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
He didn't say where to go.

454
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
He didn't say anything?

455
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
He rarely leaves the door.

456
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Then Mr. Xuan will tell you.

457
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Well,

458
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,120
we are different now.

459
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
We are different.

460
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
You two still have a long relationship?

461
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Why do I think you are a little bit hot-headed?

462
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,120
It's not good to see him again.

463
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
But recently, he is a little strange.

464
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
What do you like?

465
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
He is very ordinary.

466
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,120
But he is a good looking man.

467
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
He has a lot of clothes and martial arts.

468
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
He has his own house and shop.

469
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
He has no husband and wife.

470
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
He has no relatives.

471
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
So,

472
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
he is really good looking.

473
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
No wonder you like him.

474
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I am a little bit heartbroken.

475
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I like him not because of this.

476
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,120
I am very relieved when I am with him.

477
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Relieved?

478
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
No matter what he does,

479
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,120
I won't be afraid as long as he is here.

480
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
You are really in the mood.

481
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Don't talk about me.

482
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Your house is big and spacious.

483
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
You must have spent a lot of money.

484
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
Didn't the neighbor just die?

485
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,120
He took some of the furniture and paid a little.

486
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
And he is in a hurry.

487
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
So I moved here.

488
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,120
You are so bold.

489
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,120
I am afraid of those who don't hide the house.

490
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
The evil father of Yanghua is here.

491
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Come out.

492
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
The evil father of Yanghua is here.

493
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
He is the one who killed my uncle.

494
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
I will tell my uncle Tang today.

495
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Yes.

496
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
I didn't steal.

497
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
If you didn't steal,

498
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
why did my uncle lose so long?

499
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
He is so heartbroken.

500
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,120
You are so kind.

501
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,120
You are so kind.

502
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
You are so kind.

503
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
You are so kind.

504
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,120
You have no right to stay in our house.

505
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Yes.

506
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
Yes.

507
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Yes.

508
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
So many people are watching you.

509
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Why?

510
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Do you want to be in the middle of the street?

511
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Yes.

512
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Yes.

513
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Yes.

514
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Yes.

515
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Yes.

516
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Yes.

517
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Yes.

518
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Yes.

519
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Yes.

520
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Yes.

521
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Yes.

522
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Yes.

523
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Yes.

524
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
I admit that it's all my fault.

525
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,120
I shouldn't have been a woman.

526
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken care of you.

527
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,120
I would have been punished if you were so kind.

528
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
What are you talking about?

529
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
What are you talking about?

530
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,120
You think I don't understand?

531
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,120
You are so kind.

532
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
You just want to deduct my crime.

533
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,120
You want me to go out and break my property.

534
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
You are so kind.

535
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You are so kind.

536
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I will kill you.

537
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Let go of me.

538
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Let go of me.

539
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Let go of me.

540
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Let go of me.

541
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Let go of me.

542
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Have you seen a thug before?

543
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
You are so kind.

544
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
I should...

545
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,120
So many of you are bullying a weak woman.

546
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

547
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Don't scare people.

548
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
What are you doing?

549
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
What are we doing?

550
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
You can control me.

551
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
You are hurting people on purpose.

552
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
They are injured.

553
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
If you don't leave, I will report to the police.

554
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Fine.

555
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
You are so good.

556
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I don't believe you can protect her forever.

557
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
I will wait for you.

558
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Wait!

559
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Are you okay?

560
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
As a street fighter,

561
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,120
I heard about your wife's case.

562
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
I shouldn't have said that.

563
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Your husband is a wine lover.

564
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,120
He is a man who loves to be beaten up.

565
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
He is dead.

566
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,120
He is a kind of relief to you.

567
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Why don't you report to the police?

568
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
You are a man.

569
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
If they find you again,

570
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
what will you do?

571
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,120
They will beat you to death.

572
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
What?

573
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Do you have any idea?

574
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Don't be afraid of them.

575
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,120
The more you are afraid of them, the more they will bully you.

576
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,120
It seems that the three-way street is really a narrow street.

577
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Wen Xia, do you remember the day

578
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,120
when the man who died was also in the street?

579
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Do you know him?

580
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
No.

581
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
I live here.

582
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
We are neighbors.

583
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,120
If you need any help, call me.

584
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Thank you.

585
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Let's go.

586
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
You again?

587
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
I haven't gone to see you.

588
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
You are still here.

589
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:43,320
With all your heart I will keep my promise to myboth

600
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Then where are these applause?

601
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,620
I don't know.

602
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,120
I have never been so电力.

603
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Yes.

604
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,000
Unscrew the rope.

605
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Then kneel down and give the three of you a head.

606
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,200
Then I'll take you to look for her.

607
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
You don't know her?

608
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Shunyi.

609
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Shunyi.

610
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
Do you know Xuanye?

611
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,560
Take me to see her.

612
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Don't think so.

613
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,520
Then I'll kill you.

614
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,600
I don't think so.

615
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,040
I'm not patient.

616
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Three.

617
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Two.

618
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
I'll take you there.

619
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,800
I can take you to see her.

620
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
After you see her, you must let me go.

621
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Okay.

622
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I'll let you go after I see her.

623
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Dr. Jiu is not here.

624
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,400
Come again next time.

625
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,600
He's been here for three days.

626
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
He's been gone for three days.

627
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Think about it.

628
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Is he going somewhere?

629
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,400
Where have you been for so many days?

630
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Xia.

631
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
It's really you.

632
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,800
Don't you know me?

633
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,000
It's me, Li Xian.

634
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Jiu.

635
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This is the wife of my fiancé.

636
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Uncle.

637
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Aunt.

638
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,600
After hearing about the second brother-in-law,

639
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,400
I came here without rest.

640
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,000
It's a great thing.

641
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
Uncle Duan came back and found her.

642
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,000
My dad had a lot of fun after he knew about this.

643
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
If he hadn't been a good worker,

644
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
he would have followed me.

645
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,800
You've worked hard, Lu Tong Yao Yuan.

646
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Uncle, you're welcome.

647
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
We're family now.

648
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Oh, right.

649
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,800
This is Dr. Jiu.

650
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Jiu's brother.

651
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,800
He's my savior.

652
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm a very dangerous person.

653
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,200
I'm not a coward.

654
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,400
I'm a vicious man.

655
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm a man of the past.

656
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm a man of the past.

657
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,200
If it weren't for Jiu's good intentions,

658
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,600
and he had a lot of trouble in the region,

659
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm afraid that I can't keep my body here.

660
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,600
Jiu is not only a good worker,

661
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,000
but also a good worker.

662
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,400
He's also a good student.

663
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
He's a good man.

664
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,600
We're here to talk about the world

665
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,200
and the world.

666
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
It feels like we're talking about a story.

667
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,200
The thing is,

668
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
we meet and hate each other.

669
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,200
I don't know what you mean.

670
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,400
We met Dr. Jiu for a while.

671
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
He's also

672
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,200
our savior.

673
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
What a coincidence!

674
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Jiu,

675
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,600
I thought we were friends.

676
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,800
I should have said that

677
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,200
we learned from each other,

678
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
and we're friends.

679
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
He's not willing to do that.

680
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Thank you for saving Li Xianzhi's life.

681
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,000
This is my great gratitude

682
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
for my family and my family.

683
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I've been living in the old town.

684
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,200
I'm tired.

685
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Why don't you go home and rest?

686
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I'll stay at the banquet hall in Yanlai House

687
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,800
and sing together at the Yuen Palace.

688
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
You're right.

689
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,400
Jiu,

690
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
don't push yourself too hard.

691
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Okay.

692
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
I'll go back first.

693
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,600
Yes,

694
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,200
please help me send Jiu off.

695
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Jiu,

696
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
I'll be there in time.

697
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Xueyan.

698
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Xueyan.

699
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
You know that

700
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
I've told my dad about the proposal.

701
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
He's going to write a letter to Li Jia.

702
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,400
I don't know why

703
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,600
Li Xian came.

704
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,000
Are you angry?

705
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm not.

706
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Really?

707
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Yes.

708
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Go back.

709
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,200
He came for you.

710
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,400
Don't lose Li Shu.

711
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,600
But...

712
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm really fine.

713
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,600
Okay.

714
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,400
I'll go find you later.

715
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay.

716
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Pu Sa,

717
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
I'm here again.

718
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Li Sanlong is dead.

719
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think

720
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,400
you'll be in danger

721
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,400
if you hear my prayers.

722
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
My daughter is in a sad state.

723
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,400
She married Zhang Po at the age of 15.

724
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,800
Her husband is still young and innocent.

725
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,800
She's not good at scolding me.

726
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,800
After her husband died,

727
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,000
Li Sanlong,

728
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,600
who bullied me and took care of me,

729
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
came to take advantage of me.

730
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
I had no choice but to beg you.

731
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
But I didn't expect you to hear it.

732
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,600
Pu Sa,

733
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
you helped me twice.

734
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,000
I thought I could start a new life.

735
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,400
But why still can't?

736
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,200
Is it because I'm not

737
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
happy enough in my life?

738
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
If I'm a man,

739
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
everything will be different.

740
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,400
Pu Sa, I beg you.

741
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This is the last time I beg you.

742
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,200
I beg you to be happy.

743
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,000
It's too hard for women.

744
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
Next life,

745
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
I'll be a man.

746
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Take care.

747
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
Fan Xia.

748
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,200
Are you looking for Xuanye?

749
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,600
Yes.

750
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,400
She's not here.

751
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Where did she go?

752
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
She went fishing.

753
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'll go find her.

754
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,200
Shixue,

755
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,600
take the umbrella.

756
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,800
I don't want to be involved in the evil evil.

757
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,600
I have a lot of potential.

758
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,800
I don't want to see my daughter

759
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,400
marry a important woman.

760
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,400
Go!

761
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,200
Xuanye.

762
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I'm here.

763
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm here to see you.

764
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
I've been looking for you for a long time.

765
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,200
It's going to rain.

766
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
So I'm here to pick you up.

767
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,400
Let's go home.

768
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,200
It's going to rain soon.

769
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Fan Xia,

770
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,600
I have something to tell you.

771
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
We can't go home.

772
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Let's go.

773
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,800
We'll stop here.
