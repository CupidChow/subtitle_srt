[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

2
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,710
What is this?

4
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,110
Now take a look

5
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,740
and see if you can see it.

6
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,670
It's okay.

7
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,250
Don't be afraid.

8
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,830
You're a demon hunter.

9
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,020
You won't leave me alone, right?

10
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
Mountain demons won't hurt the living.

11
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,700
It's fate that we meet.

12
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,930
The mountain demons values fate

13
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,100
more than we do.

14
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,600
This is their way of welcoming you.

15
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,430
Are you refusing their toast?

16
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,290
You're making things difficult.

17
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,560
Don't waste it.

18
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,060
It can help prolong your life.

19
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
Were those mountain demons?

20
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,320
A mountain can also become a demon?

21
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,080
From the mountains, rivers, sun and moon,

22
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,880
to the flowers, birds and insects.

23
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,390
As long as one receives a primordial spirit,

24
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,450
they can then train to become a demon.

25
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,510
To put it bluntly,

26
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,230
isn't it the same for humans?

27
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,680
If you remain unenlightened,

28
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
we are just a mess of flesh and blood.

29
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,240
When you have gained enlightenment,

30
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
you'll then know the rules of etiquette,

31
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,750
talk about what is shameful,

32
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,950
tell the right from the wrong,

33
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,270
and ascend to a throne above all beings.

34
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,680
What is primordial spirit?

35
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,150
It's a sacred object of the demon clan.

36
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,680
You can think of it as a seed.

37
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,060
If you get it, you can become smarter,

38
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,300
practice sorcery,

39
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,700
and prolong your life.

40
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,870
Furthermore,

41
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,900
one can control the wind and rain

42
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,960
and metamorphose into a human being.

43
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,950
Can you sell me

44
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,480
that bottle of the medicine

45
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,100
which you just gave me?

46
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,530
You want to let your cousin try it?

47
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,070
You can't use it even if I give it to you.

48
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,150
The reason why I could help you unblock your vision just now

49
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,280
is because you have a unique physique.

50
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,560
But for others,

51
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,950
knowing that there are demons on earth

52
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,950
may not necessarily be a good thing.

53
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,830
Do you have any other ways

54
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,830
that will allow Yanqiu to stay safe?

55
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,880
Get rid of that menace

56
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,740
in your family.

57
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,760
That demon is called the Human-faced Owl.

58
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,150
It's a rather old demon.

59
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,050
It has a human face with a beast's body,

60
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,360
like a dog's tail on a horse's body,

61
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,070
but with a physical form of an owl.

62
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,590
The legendary Human-faced Owl

63
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,120
is a sign of major disaster.

64
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,909
If you see it,

65
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,920
there will be severe drought in the region.

66
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,390
However,

67
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,650
those are just rumors.

68
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,220
The Human-faced Owl I saw

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,980
was just like any other demon.

70
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,800
They are just good at changing.

71
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
It likes to eat the human throat.

72
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,150
Every time it eats up a throat,

73
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,060
the Human-faced Owl can possess the person's voice

74
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,190
and mimic its sound.

75
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,880
That's why Human-faced Owl

76
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,640
can vocalize a hundred tones in one voice.

77
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
It smells strange

78
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,180
and it is very horrible.

79
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,510
This medicine is called Bitter Throat.

80
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,560
It can keep your cousin's life safe

81
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,620
for the time being.

82
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,150
That demon

83
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,870
must have set her eyes on

84
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,070
your cousin's voice.

85
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,420
She has previously hurt people

86
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,220
at Guangping.

87
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,290
She bit the throat of the people

88
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,880
whose voices she wanted to possess.

89
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,560
[Duan Residence]

90
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,580
I followed it all the way here

91
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,550
just so that I could get rid of this menace.

92
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,080
I didn't expect your cousin

93
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,790
to mistake me as the murderer.

94
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,690
If he hadn't been busy

95
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,990
looking for me these few days

96
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,000
and thus did not return home...

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,650
Young Master.

98
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,250
I'm afraid that demon would have gotten to him.

99
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,210
My Lady, My Lady!

100
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,410
Young Master is back.

101
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,230
Yes.

102
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,760
Let's hurry.

103
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,290
Are you okay, My Lady?

104
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,360
I'm fine.

105
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,470
Hurry.

106
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,270
Let's serve it now.

107
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,780
Okay.

108
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,840
Yanqiu.

109
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,730
Banxia.

110
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,440
You're back.

111
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,790
Did you manage to catch the bad guy?

112
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,130
The authorities have casted a wide net.

113
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,330
We'll catch them alive sooner or later.

114
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,570
You don't have to worry.

115
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,990
Anything else?

116
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,150
I noticed that you haven't been looking good lately.

117
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,080
I made some

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
tonic for you.

119
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,740
Drink it while it's hot.

120
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,980
Thank you,

121
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,970
but no need.

122
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,370
Young Master,

123
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,020
please just take a sip.

124
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,870
She went to Jishi Clinic

125
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,070
early in the morning,

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,160
then cleaned and boiled the tonic

127
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,620
for more than half the day.

128
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,640
She even scalded her hand.

129
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,830
She has put a lot of effort into it.

130
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,090
You scalded yourself?

131
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,100
Have you applied any medicine?

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,360
Should we get a doctor?

133
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,210
Yes, I have.

134
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,330
It's okay.

135
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,720
You should take the tonic while it's hot.

136
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,550
What tonic is this?

137
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,610
Why is it so bitter?

138
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,410
Good medicine always tastes bitter.

139
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,480
They said it will only work

140
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,390
if you drink up to the last drop.

141
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,210
Thank you.

142
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,670
I'm leaving.

143
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,900
Bitter Throat?

144
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,060
My Lady,

145
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,860
come and wash your face.

146
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,780
My Lady,

147
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,640
are you cold?

148
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,610
I'm fine.

149
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,820
It's getting late.

150
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,560
You should go wash up and sleep.

151
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,350
I'm not sleepy yet.

152
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,850
You can go and sleep first.

153
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,980
Elder Madam,

154
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,780
Young Madam is here to greet you.

155
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Let her in.

156
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,320
Yes.

157
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,580
Man'er sends her greetings

158
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,160
to Grandmother

159
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,880
and Mother-in-Law.

160
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,320
Rise.

161
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,350
Thank you, Grandmother.

162
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm useless.

163
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,110
I've been sick for the past two days

164
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,660
and hence couldn't pay respects to Grandmother and Mother-in-Law.

165
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,720
Please forgive me.

166
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,230
There was a thief in the house that day.

167
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,060
Qiu said you were frightened.

168
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,090
Are you okay now?

169
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
Thanks for your concern.

170
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,950
I am okay now.

171
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,830
Although we are not

172
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,040
a very rich family

173
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,560
and we may not have as many formalities,

174
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,660
we should at least observe

175
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
basic etiquette.

176
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,750
Since you have married into our family,

177
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,950
forget about what happened in the past.

178
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,280
You have to be hardworking and thrift,

179
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,920
follow the rules and observe the rituals,

180
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,990
and take good care of your husband.

181
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,520
Don't let down

182
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,830
his love for you.

183
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,470
You're right, Grandmother.

184
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,160
I have remembered that.

185
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,560
Sit over there.

186
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,590
Yes, Grandmother.

187
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,450
I heard from my husband that

188
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,320
you gave him a bowl of tonic

189
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,710
yesterday.

190
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,100
He was very appreciative of it.

191
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,040
I was wondering

192
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,870
where did you get this panacea?

193
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,610
Can you lend me the prescription to copy?

194
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,520
If you need it,

195
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,590
I can write a copy for you.

196
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,470
You are so kind.

197
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,870
How about

198
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,400
you drop by my room later?

199
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,660
No need.

200
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,930
I have something to do today.

201
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,970
What is it?

202
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,070
A few days ago,

203
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,770
I saw that Father's hair had turned white.

204
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I want to buy some black beans

205
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,370
and make into bean dye,

206
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,200
so that Father can dye his hair.

207
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,790
You are so thoughtful.

208
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,670
Your father is blessed,

209
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,990
unlike me and your uncle.

210
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,110
Grandmother,

211
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,610
I'll take my leave.

212
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,710
Xuanye,

213
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,160
without you,

214
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,920
can Manniang

215
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,320
handle it all by herself?

216
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,930
She's fine during the day.

217
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,790
There are many people around her.

218
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,230
Do you remember

219
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,150
what I told you?

220
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,690
Yes.

221
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,370
Xuanye,

222
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,280
your rival.

223
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,520
He's pretty fast with his actions.

224
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,120
Let me help you deal with him.

225
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,160
Go back first.

226
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,750
I don't need you here.

227
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,640
Don't forget what's going to happen tonight.

228
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Long time no see, Physician Jiu.

229
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,620
Every time I see you,

230
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,550
you are either eating or drinking.

231
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,920
How relaxed.

232
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,240
Well, I can't compare against you, Chief Constable Chu,

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,480
who is always running around energetically.

234
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,740
I am just working hard.

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,340
I got lost on my way here

236
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,710
and was delayed for two days.

237
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,040
Is this one of your tricks, Physician Jiu?

238
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,810
In your heart,

239
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,240
am I not a swindler?

240
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,410
How could that be considered at trick?

241
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,520
[Chief Constable of Guangping City, Chu Youhuang]

242
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,680
Show me your

243
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,740
travel documents.

244
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,330
I don't have it.

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750
You don't have it?

246
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,250
All travelers and horses that come in and out

247
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,590
must be checked accordingly for their documents.

248
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,670
If you don't have it, that means you have crossed illegally.

249
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,570
If so, I have to

250
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,390
take you back to Guangping City.

251
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,930
Well, isn't my lack of travel documents

252
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,990
all thanks do your doing?

253
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,990
I am just working according to the law.

254
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,920
According to the law,

255
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,520
those who are in currently enlisted or have committed crimes,

256
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,720
will not be issued with the travel pass.

257
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,320
Physician Jiu,

258
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,550
do you still remember

259
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,700
the six murder cases

260
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,810
at Changping Alley, along Sifang Street?

261
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,710
Don't be nervous.

262
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,580
I didn't track you here this time around.

263
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,560
The bandit who cut throats

264
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,690
has fled to Nanyang.

265
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,890
I'm here to investigate the case.

266
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,750
But isn't it such a coincidence?

267
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,440
Whenever there is a murder,

268
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,920
you are always around.

269
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,290
Physician Jiu,

270
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,150
you seem to like to join in the fun.

271
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,710
The throat-cutting cases were the actions of a demon.

272
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,840
You can't handle it.

273
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,500
Again, a demon?

274
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,920
Just like how six years ago,

275
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,400
your entire family

276
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,890
was killed by demons?

277
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,470
I'm just a mere mortal.

278
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,200
I can't see through deception.

279
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,870
Even if I know you had committed murder,

280
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,400
I was unable to convict you.

281
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,310
I don't buy the same lies

282
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,319
that others believe in.

283
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,430
Chief Constable Chu,

284
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,160
I have said

285
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,490
all that I wanted to say.

286
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,470
If you get hurt or even die

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,560
because you insist on trying,

288
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,240
don't come blaming me instead.

289
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,119
Waiter!

290
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,619
I will have the bill.

291
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,150
Okay, please wait a moment.

292
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,230
You can order

293
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,960
something for yourself to eat.

294
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,710
Thank you.

295
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,130
[Nanyang City Government]

296
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,270
Help!

297
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,310
Anyone? Help!

298
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,850
Why are you going out so late?

299
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,710
Father.

300
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,080
The scoundrel has appeared in the government office.

301
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Be careful.

302
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,120
Do you have enough people with you?

303
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,650
How about

304
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,570
bringing all of our guards there?

305
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,310
No need.

306
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,760
Let's go.

307
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,050
Hurry. Follow them.

308
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,600
Yes.

My Lady,

324
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,950
Young Master went out.

325
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,980
Other than the Elder Master,

326
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,110
every other male has followed him out.

327
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,740
What's happening?

328
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,970
Tingzhou?

329
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,750
Tingzhou!

330
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,540
Tingzhou, what's wrong with you?

331
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,070
Is my singing so awful?

332
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,870
Why is is that you are still awake

333
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,000
when everyone else has fallen asleep?

334
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,950
Since you can see through me,

335
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,920
you should know that

336
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,080
if I want to hurt your brother,

337
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,010
I can do it at the snap of my fingers.

338
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,030
I've told you before that

339
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,640
I really like him.

340
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,310
I want to be with him forever.

341
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,310
Why don't you believe me?

342
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,360
Since you provoked me first

343
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,650
and kept making things difficult for me,

344
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,920
then you can't blame me

345
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,560
for showing my hand either.

346
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,210
You have quite a few tricks up your sleeve.

347
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,990
My Lady!

348
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,810
My Lady!

349
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,760
My Lady, are you alright?

350
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,750
Young Master is back.

351
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,110
Grandmother.

352
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,950
Mother.

353
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,990
Yanqiu,

354
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
why are you back?

355
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,970
Where is the scoundrel?

356
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,220
Have you found him?

357
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,990
I chased him till we were out of the town,

358
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,310
but we then lost track of the scoundrel.

359
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,510
So, I came back first.

360
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,990
You were frightened.

361
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,000
Are you feeling better now?

362
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,440
I am much better now.

363
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,410
Thank you for your concern.

364
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,980
Let me ask you something.

365
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,780
It's about your sister-in-law.

366
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,950
I heard from the servants that

367
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,680
after I left,

368
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,030
Manniang came to your place.

369
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,760
Is that true?

370
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,400
Yes.

371
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,920
Then was she abducted by the scoundrel

372
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,750
at your place?

373
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,310
Yes.

374
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,550
You two don't know each other well.

375
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,790
Why did she come here?

376
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,160
I don't know.

377
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,470
The scoundrel came as soon as she entered.

378
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,900
I heard from Tingzhou that

379
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,600
when she woke up,

380
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,640
she found you on the ground

381
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,950
looking terrified and flustered.

382
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,120
Since you were sober,

383
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,470
did you see the scoundrel's face?

384
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,300
Was it the same person

385
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,360
from the last time?

386
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,310
I didn't see him clearly.

387
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,470
Why wouldn't you?

388
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,030
The last time the scoundrel was came in,

389
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,790
you were there too.

390
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,880
This time, all of them

391
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,410
even gathered in your room.

392
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,920
Do you personally know that scoundrel?

393
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,400
You...

394
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,550
Enough.

395
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,640
What are you talking about?

396
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,710
Your sister is tired.

397
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,360
Let her rest first.

398
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,680
Grandmother,

399
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,750
Manniang has been abducted.

400
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,530
Her life is at risk.

401
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,860
I need more information

402
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,400
before I can find her.

403
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
That scoundrel

404
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,940
kept showing up

405
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,060
over and over again

406
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,310
because he is clearly

407
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,710
coming for the two of you.

408
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,010
What's the use of

409
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,550
to interrogating your sister?

410
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,260
She is a good lady who very rarely

411
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,040
steps out of the house

412
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,160
and has been living in Yuanzhou for a long time.

413
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,760
How will she ever come to know of any scoundrel?

414
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,150
But your bride instead

415
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,320
was originally

416
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,430
working in

417
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,850
the brothel and taverns.

418
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,220
It's little wonder what kind of people

419
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,120
she would have gotten to know from outside.

420
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,550
Even if you are now married,

421
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,810
others still want to take her away alive.

422
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,680
Grandmother!

423
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,310
Enough.

424
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,360
Say no more.

425
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,710
Mother,

426
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,310
Yanqiu was too anxious

427
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,310
and lost his mind.

428
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,790
I'll lead him away now.

429
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,470
Banxia,

430
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,790
rest well first.

431
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,360
If there's anything, let's talk about it

432
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,890
tomorrow morning instead.

433
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,290
I'll take my leave.

434
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,710
I've asked someone

435
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
to warm up the calming tonic

436
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,200
in the kitchen.

437
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,440
If your lady wakes up in the middle of the night,

438
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,880
give her another bowl.

439
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
Yes, Madam.

440
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,330
Your father is not home either.

441
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,160
If you have any difficulties,

442
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,350
you can just share it with me.

443
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,590
I will help you.

444
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,110
Grandmother,

445
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,710
don't worry.

446
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,170
I believe that in this world

447
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,450
everything is based on karma.

448
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,880
You've been kind to people all your life

449
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,530
and you are blessed with abundant fortune.

450
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,270
I am sure it will help to protect

451
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,270
all of us in the younger generation.

452
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,990
Everything will be fine.

453
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,080
Where else do you want to go?

454
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
This gentleman,

455
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,500
we don't have any grudges in the past,

456
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,480
neither did we have any grudges recently.

457
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,810
Why must you make things difficult for me?

458
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,640
Can't you let me go?

459
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,990
How old are you?

460
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,280
You're still so naive.

461
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,310
I will be back.

462
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,360
My Lady,

463
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,950
it's already late.

464
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,120
Why are you still up?

465
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,510
I am preparing to make some bean dye

466
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,440
so that I can help Father to dye his hair when he is back.

467
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,900
The Elder Master needs to dye his hair again?

468
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,150
It hasn't been long since the last time.

469
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,820
Are you not angry with Elder Master anymore?

470
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,680
In my opinion,

471
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,920
Mr. Li is actually quite nice.

472
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,020
At the very least, we know each other well, right?

473
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,600
You're still young.

474
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,970
You don't understand.

475
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,900
By the way, My Lady,

476
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,790
you have a letter

477
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,320
and I placed it on your desk.

478
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,880
What letter?

479
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,310
It was said that someone sent it

480
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,570
and specified it should be handed to you.

481
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,720
Did they mention who sent it?

482
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,970
The servant at the door didn't tell me.

483
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Could it be written by Elder Master?

484
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,190
Help me look after the pot.

485
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,250
I'll go take a look.

486
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,080
Where is this?

487
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,930
Is anyone there?

488
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,580
Don't you come over!

489
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,010
My good little sister,

490
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,900
where do you think you are going?

491
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,370
Don't scare her. She's already terrified.

492
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
What are you terrified of?

493
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
I never wanted to hurt her.

494
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,440
She provoked me first.

495
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,320
You seduced her brother.

496
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,090
Of course she won't be happy about it.

497
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,550
What do you mean by seduce?

498
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,260
We love each other.

499
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,060
We should be together forever.

500
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,730
She was the one who ruined

501
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,930
this marriage first.

502
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,270
My good little sister,

503
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,290
how should I punish you

504
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,210
for breaking up my marriage?

505
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,090
Your throat is so beautiful.

506
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,710
How about

507
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,840
I eat it?

508
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,530
My good little sister,

509
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,860
stop running.

510
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,360
You can't run away from me.

511
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,230
Why did she find me again?

512
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,670
Something happened.

513
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,570
It's you again!

514
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,690
I'm the one who hurt you.

515
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,640
How could you

516
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,100
vent your anger on others?

517
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,840
I've never provoked you.

518
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,990
Why are you haunting me

519
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,250
and keep making things difficult for me?

520
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,640
I have no choice.

521
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,980
You are a demon.

522
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm a demon hunter.

523
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,270
You did something bad.

524
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,120
Isn't it natural for me

525
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,980
to make things difficult for you?

526
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,230
I told you

527
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,310
I don't want to hurt anyone this time.

528
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,750
You've gone too far.

529
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,080
Tell him that

530
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,840
although I have hurt countless of people,

531
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,800
I never wanted to hurt him.

532
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,920
I...

533
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,300
really liked him.

534
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,640
Is she dead?

535
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,930
She's dead.

536
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
Will she come back alive?

537
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,600
No.

538
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,990
[Duan Residence]

539
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,750
Young Master,

540
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,880
she's awake now.

541
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,460
You can do away with the formalities.

542
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,380
Last night,

543
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,300
you fainted in front of Shengping Theater

544
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,199
and was found by officials

545
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,199
who sent you back.

546
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,560
That day,

547
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,920
I was too reckless.

548
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,929
Please don't take it to heart.

549
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,409
I heard from the maid that

550
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,350
a few days ago,

551
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,000
when Manniang was bedridden,

552
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,260
you had went to see her?

553
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,120
She don't come from a good background

554
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,850
and everyone looks down on her.

555
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,230
I thank you

556
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,790
on her behalf.

557
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,510
I believe that night,

558
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,909
Manniang went to find you

559
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,639
because she was also feeling moody

560
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,170
and wanted to chat with you.

561
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,570
We didn't expect that she would meet the scoundrel.

562
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,750
But after all, you are a woman without much strength yourself.

563
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,350
The scoundrel

564
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,480
is still at large.

565
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,870
It was too dangerous for you

566
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,480
to go to a place like

567
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,679
Shengping Theater

568
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,610
to find her all by yourself.

569
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,870
I'm her husband

570
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,560
and an official.

571
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,600
I will find her back

572
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,080
through both official and unofficial means.

573
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,770
So,

574
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,190
don't you worry anymore.

575
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,850
I understand.

576
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,800
I have work to do.

577
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,960
I'm leaving.

578
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,940
Brother.

579
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,270
If...

580
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,890
we can never find sister-in-law

581
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,630
ever again,

582
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,640
what would you do?

583
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,490
Don't think too much.

584
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,580
Have a good rest.

585
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,090
The one who rears rabbits!

586
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,540
The one who rears rabbits!

587
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,690
The one who rears rabbits!

588
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
The one who rears rabbits!

589
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,520
Who are you?

590
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,030
Where did this little thief come from?

591
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,560
You! Stop right there!

592
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,430
Stop!

593
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,050
Stop!

594
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,980
The one who rears rabbits!

595
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,040
The one who rears rabbits?

596
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,750
I don't rear rabbits.

597
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,870
My surname is Jiu,

598
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,070
and my name is Xuanye.

599
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,610
My surname is Duan, name is Banxia.

600
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,350
I know.

601
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,000
What is this?

602
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,440
It's for you.

603
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,910
Food?

604
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,440
Anything else?

605
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,930
I am talking about food.

606
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,800
You have ate all the food I brought,

607
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,940
but I have some more at home.

608
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,080
Forget it.

609
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,080
You can really eat.

610
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
What brings you here?

611
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,630
I wanted to ask

612
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,620
if my sister-in-law is really dead?

613
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,230
Her soul is gone

614
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,960
and she died a thorough death.

615
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,870
Even the presence of the Great Immortal

616
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,830
can't save her.

617
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,900
You don't have to worry about this anymore.

618
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,430
What's up?

619
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,560
You seem to miss her.

620
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,230
Not really.

621
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,640
So did Manniang marry my brother

622
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,310
just to

623
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,480
to take his voice?

624
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,000
That I don't know.

625
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,100
What she thinks has nothing to do with me.

626
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,940
I only know demons

627
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,290
could be good or bad.

628
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,480
If it has the thoughts to kill,

629
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,600
or to disturb people's safety,

630
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,870
we must kill them all

631
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,800
to prevent future troubles.

632
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,310
I advise you

633
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,680
not to think too much.

634
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,200
When you have such eyes,

635
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,390
you are bound to come across demons

636
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,200
in this life.

637
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,880
Demons are good at bewitching people.

638
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,970
If you don't raise your guard,

639
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,540
you'll fall into their trap sooner or later.

640
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,710
Alright.

641
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
I'm going back to Guangping.

642
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,840
Do you have any plans?

643
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,600
Plans?

644
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,690
Are you going to

645
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,390
keep smelling this calming fragrance

646
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,720
and lie to yourself that

647
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,840
there are no demons in this world?

648
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,200
My family

649
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,560
doesn't like me to be seeing those things.

650
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,750
What about you?

651
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,430
I don't like it either.

652
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,820
This time, it was my brother

653
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
was stalked by a demon,

654
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
so I had no choice.

655
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,060
But I won't always

656
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,830
be so unlucky, right?

657
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,870
Maybe.

658
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,600
But doing so,

659
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,630
you're just deceiving yourself.

660
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,430
You can fool yourself for a while,

661
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,520
but not forever.

662
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,600
But what can I do?

663
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,600
Am I supposed to be a demon hunter like you?

664
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,710
I'm not that capable.

665
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,840
I just want to be an ordinary person

666
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,690
and live a good life.

667
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,430
Give me your hand.

668
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,070
Give me your hand.

669
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,870
Done.

670
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,200
This is the self-protection seal.

671
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,000
I created it.

672
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,570
Even if you meet

673
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,970
a demon who has been cultivated for a 100 years,

674
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,170
you will still stand a fighting chance.

675
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,880
In the future,

676
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,740
if you encounter any trouble,

677
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,420
you can come to Guangping City to find me.

678
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,560
Guangping City?

679
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,760
Where do you live?

680
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,910
Do you live alone?

681
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,330
Or with your family?

682
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,570
I have no family.

683
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
If you come to Guangping,

684
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,560
you can come to Sifang Street,

685
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,400
Changping Alley.

686
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,860
Find me at Ganshan Clinic.

687
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,640
Ganshan Clinic?

688
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,350
Although I am a demon hunter,

689
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,560
I am also a physician.

690
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,730
Ganshan Clinic is my pharmacy.

691
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,350
Do you

692
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,910
anything else to ask?

693
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,430
No.

694
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,520
Go back then.

695
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,120
Thank you for today.

696
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,040
I'll get going then.

697
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,480
She's so bold.

698
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,430
She's a girl,

699
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,960
yet she's not afraid of such a dark mountain road.

700
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,340
♫Captured in the mirror♫

701
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,030
♫The phantom of the moon♫

702
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,150
♫ What's in the destiny to be quelled♫

703
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,660
♫Don't wake up the person dreaming♫

704
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,530
♫Within the clouds and mist♫

705
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,030
♫I carefully imprint your face♫

706
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:13,290
♫To resist the piercing edge of the long night♫

707
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,290
♫I can stand in that forest♫

708
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,880
♫Waiting for a hundred years♫

709
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,290
♫Hoping to meet you again♫

710
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:30,640
♫Through the long night, the light shines bright♫

711
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,900
♫I want to fly across earth and sink into the sea♫

712
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,580
♫And across the mountains and rivers♫

713
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,760
♫Just to see you♫
