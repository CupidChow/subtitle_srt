1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Here we go we are back.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,380
And the final impression

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,260
We got overloaded

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,080
When aceğimo realized, he was Corey

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,980
For a seat from through the air

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,740
I didn't expect him to say that

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:59,740
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

8
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:29,740
sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure

9
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:49,460
Ko yapıyorsun

10
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,120
This time I'll Nag as a Took you museum

11
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
and have a good life

12
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,540
Okay.

13
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,940
Banxia, why don't you listen to me

14
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,620
and go with us?

15
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,220
I don't recommend going to the mountains.

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,260
It's boring.

17
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,460
Fine.

18
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,300
You stay at home.

19
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,060
Don't run around.

20
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,980
I know.

21
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,180
Let's go.

22
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,780
Okay.

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,780
Banxia, don't be so rash.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes.

25
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,700
Let's go.

26
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,100
Hurry.

27
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,700
Miss, look at that one.

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,460
That one looks so pretty.

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,780
Miss!

30
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,140
Take a look at this.

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,740
Look at this.

32
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,580
Lotus Flash.

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,180
Man, it looks good.

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,060
Miss, look.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
So beautiful!

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Miss!

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
Miss!

38
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,740
Are you okay, Miss?

39
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Miss!

40
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Miss, come and have a look.

41
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,740
See if there's any item you like.

42
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Miss, come and have a look.

43
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
How much is this?

44
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,740
I've already received your money.

45
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,740
I can't receive it again.

46
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Miss, the source of the treasure is here.

47
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,740
Miss, come and have a look.

48
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Bai Xia, you seem to like Xuan Ye.

49
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
Do you know?

50
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Bai Xia.

51
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Have you forgotten me?

52
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
You must give me an answer today.

53
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Do you accept my feelings?

54
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Do you like me? Do you want to be with me?

55
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
I don't have this answer today.

56
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Bai Xia, in this world,

57
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,740
there's no one who can be with me.

58
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,740
I'm not a person who can be with me.

59
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,740
I'm not a person who can be with me.

60
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,740
I'm not a person who can be with me.

61
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Bai Xia, in this world,

62
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,740
there's nothing that will exist forever.

63
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
With time's passing,

64
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,740
feelings will grow bigger and even disappear.

65
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
You only need a short time.

66
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,740
After this short time, everything will get better.

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
I'm sorry, Miss.

68
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,740
You really won't come to Guang Ping again?

70
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,740
It's a long journey, but the past won't change.

71
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,740
I won't meet you again.

72
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,740
My surname is Jiu, and my name is Xuan Ye.

73
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,740
I'll be the first to break off Ming's family.

74
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Miss, Miss.

75
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Miss.

76
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Xuan Ye, he's...

77
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,740
He's Xuan Ye.

78
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
Xuan Ye.

79
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Listen to me.

80
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,740
I remember him. He's Xuan Ye.

81
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,740
It's Xuan Ye!

82
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
What's wrong with you, Miss?

83
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Why did you forget all of my words?

84
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Who's Xuan Ye?

85
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
It's Xuan Ye!

86
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Why did you forget all of my words?

87
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Miss.

88
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
Go now.

89
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,740
The corner of the悲欢.

90
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,740
No one knows

91
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,740
the life is full of obstacles.

92
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,740
It's a long journey.

93
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Man Ying.

94
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Let's go.

95
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Cheng Fu.

96
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Take me to the underground city.

97
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
Do you need any help?

98
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,740
No. But I have this.

99
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,740
No. You need help in the underground city.

100
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
I beg you.

101
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
I'll give you all these.

102
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Here.

103
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
I beg you.

104
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Well...

105
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
I remember you.

106
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Xuan Ye.

107
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
I remember you.

108
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Xuan Ye.

109
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
Xuan Ye.

110
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Xuan Ye.

111
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
Xuan Ye.

112
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Xuan Ye.

113
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
Xuan Ye.

114
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
Xuan Ye.

115
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,740
Xuan Ye.

116
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Xuan Ye.

117
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Xuan Ye.

118
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Xuan Ye.

119
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Xuan Ye.

120
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,740
No one has lived here for a long time.

121
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
I'll clean it up.

122
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm not leaving.

123
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm in this room.

124
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,740
It looks clean.

125
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I think someone cleaned it.

126
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Is it you?

127
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,740
I used to come here to live.

128
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
I'm here to live.

129
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,740
So how long have you been thinking about it?

130
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Actually, I've been thinking about it all.

131
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
How come?

132
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Didn't you say that Chang Le recommended me to do it?

133
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,740
I don't remember anything.

134
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
I don't know why.

135
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,740
Maybe something happened in the middle.

136
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,740
What about you? How did you think about it?

137
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Do you remember the old man who sold us the underground city

138
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,740
and sold it to us?

139
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
I met him again.

140
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,740
He gave me the original sound of the sound.

141
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,740
I heard the sound and thought about it.

142
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
The sound of the sound?

143
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,740
So you've been here before?

144
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
Yes.

145
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
But the door was closed.

146
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
It was only the 12th year that the door was opened.

147
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,740
We had a treasure in the PR team.

148
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,740
We could protect the people from being locked up in the wrong place.

149
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Now there's no grass and no grass.

150
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,740
We need the people to collect the forest.

151
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
So I came out.

152
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Why didn't you come to me all the time?

153
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Actually, I've been by your side.

154
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Chang Le recommended me.

155
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Everything has changed.

156
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
You don't remember me anymore.

157
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,740
You don't remember anything.

158
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
So the name of the original book

159
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
has been there for many years.

160
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
You made it.

161
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Since I knew it earlier that some evil demons would harm people,

162
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
how could I do anything?

163
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,740
I went to find the Seven-legged Demons.

164
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
I took them out.

165
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,740
I also found the full mother.

166
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,740
But there was a little gap in the middle.

167
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
She escaped.

168
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,740
I thought she wouldn't meet you in my field.

169
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,740
After she died, she was old.

170
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
She left the Yuminus.

171
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,740
I don't know where she went.

172
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Yamin is not fast.

173
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
She didn't die.

174
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,740
So you went to the Peking-Yan Inn and met the Mother Feng?

175
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Yes.

176
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I stopped her from being evil.

177
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,740
But I didn't expect that the Green Hills are still so difficult to change.

178
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,740
After I left, Jiu Ming was in the city to save Feng Tian.

179
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
He was in the city to pay for his life.

180
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,740
He also went to find my father to beg for help.

181
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,740
When I went there, I found that Mother Feng had already killed her.

182
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,740
Feng Tian was killed by her.

183
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,740
What about Jiu Ming?

184
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,740
Jiu Ming sacrificed himself for saving Feng Tian.

185
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Jiu Ming saved Feng Tian.

186
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
You saved her?

187
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,740
I just helped her twice.

188
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Little by little, the result will be different.

189
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,740
When you scolded her, she came to the Yamin.

190
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,740
She told Zhang Pu that she asked for help.

191
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Zhang Pu saw?

192
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
She must not agree.

193
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,740
But Chilian has been in Guangping for so many years.

194
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
She is a little bit ashamed.

195
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Plus, the Yamin's Geng Daren is also a fairies.

196
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,740
She is afraid that they will be separated.

197
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
Chilian also found a job for Xing Xian.

198
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,740
This time, she won't take the burden like before.

199
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,740
Didn't you like Xing Xian before?

200
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Why did you help her?

201
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
She is not good at nature.

202
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,740
She is just a little bit lost in the hardship.

203
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,740
But the past can't be taken away from Chilian.

204
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,740
So you saved everyone?

205
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Go do what you can.

206
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
Where is Shen Tunan?

207
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
He is in the Yamin.

208
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Where is Shen Tunan? Have you seen him?

209
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
I have.

210
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
He didn't go to the Wuling City.

211
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,740
He is just a normal demon.

212
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
But he is just like before.

213
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,740
It's hard to escape the demon he has.

214
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
I taught him twice.

215
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Plus, he is my father's father's father.

216
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,740
He has been very popular these years.

217
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
That's good.

218
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
What about you?

219
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,740
Are you happy to be He Chilian?

220
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,740
I can't see my waist anymore.

221
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,740
I eat and drink every day.

222
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,740
I went to the school to study.

223
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,740
I also learned horse riding.

224
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,740
My father also taught me martial arts.

225
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,740
Although I don't treat you well, I am not bad.

226
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,740
I don't know why.

227
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,740
I just feel unhappy.

228
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,740
I feel like I am missing something.

229
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I can't remember anything.

230
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
But I don't know what it is.

231
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
What is it?

232
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I don't know what it is.

233
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,740
I don't know what it is.

234
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,740
I don't know what it is.

235
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,740
I don't know what it is.

236
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,740
I am sorry.

237
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Miss.

238
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Where are you?

239
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
I have been to the Ya Men all night.

240
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Chu is looking for you in the whole Ya Men.

241
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,740
If you can't find me today, I will tell the Master.

242
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
Okay, I'm back.

243
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
If you lose it,

244
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Master will kill me.

245
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,740
Go to the front door and report to the police.

246
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
Don't let them worry.

247
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I'll go now.

248
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Go with me.

249
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,740
I'll go back.

250
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,740
I'm not here to help you.

251
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
I just want to go back.

252
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,740
I know the rules of the factory.

253
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Can you be with him?

254
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,740
I forgot about the cause.

255
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
I told him

256
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
I'll only make him suffer.

257
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
But if you tell him,

258
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
he won't believe you.

259
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Even if he believes you,

260
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
he won't come back.

261
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
But

262
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
you've thought about it.

263
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,740
This is the biggest death for me.

264
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,740
I don't want to ask for more.

265
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Nenxi.

266
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
That's right.

267
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,740
I've learned so much

268
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,740
when I was 12 years old.

269
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
I've learned so much.

270
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Now I can play and dance.

271
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
Awesome.

272
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
Awesome.

273
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Of course.

274
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
You're so talented.

275
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
You're so good at dancing.

276
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
You're so good at cooking.

277
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
You're so good at cooking.

278
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
You're so good at dancing.

279
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
You're so good at dancing.

280
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
You've never seen me cook.

281
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
I'm going to make a dish.

282
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I'm going to make a dish.

283
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
I'm going to make a dish.

284
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
I'm going to make a dish.

285
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm going to make a dish.

286
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm going to make a dish.

287
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
I'm going to make a dish.

288
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,740
I'm going to make a dish.

289
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,740
I'm going to make a dish.

290
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm going to make a dish.

291
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
I'm going to make a dish.

292
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
I'm going to make a dish.

293
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
I'm going to make a dish.

294
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,740
I'm going to make a dish.

295
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
What's wrong?

296
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Junyan.

297
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
Let's go out and have a look.

298
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
Okay.

299
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Where do you want to go?

300
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
To the place we used to go.

301
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
We went to the building to eat and drink.

302
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
We went to the temple of the temple.

303
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
We went to the lake to fish.

304
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
We went to the lake to fish.

305
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
We went to the lake to fish.

306
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
We went to the temple to buy some snacks.

307
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
Anyway,

308
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,740
it's just that we're both happy.

309
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Let's go to the square.

310
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Okay.

311
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
We're both happy.

312
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Let's see what we can do.

313
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,740
Let's go.

314
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Let's go.

315
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
Let's go.

316
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Let's go.

317
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Let's go.

318
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Let's go.

319
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,740
What's your wish?

320
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,740
I hope that Guangping City can go to the next university.

321
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Why?

322
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Haven't you heard of it?

323
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
The old people say that

324
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
as long as the heart and mind are connected,

325
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
it's the same university.

326
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,740
Then we can go to the next university.

327
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
That's why I want to go to the next university.

328
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
I want to go to the next university.

329
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,740
I want to go to the next university.

330
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
I don't want to go to the next university.

331
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
But Guangping City is very little.

332
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Even if it's raining,

333
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
it will fall on the ground.

334
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
Don't say it's white head.

335
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
What about you?

336
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
What do you wish for?

337
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,740
I hope you can have a good life.

338
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
I have no fear.

339
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
I can enjoy myself.

340
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
You have only three wishes.

341
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
Why are you so greedy?

342
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Yes.

343
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
I'm greedy.

344
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
Wenye.

345
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
I like you so much.

346
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Can you not go?

347
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
I told you.

348
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
I just saw the three-pointed note.

349
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
I'll go and buy some coins.

350
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
I'm going to buy some coins.

351
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,740
I hope Guangping City can go to the next university.

352
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
As long as the people who are connected to each other

353
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
can go to the same university,

354
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,740
they can have a good life together.

355
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Shen Ye.

356
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Let's have a meal together.

357
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Let's have a meal?

358
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
I want to see everyone.

359
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Before you leave,

360
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,740
eat with me happily.

361
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,740
I'll be with you forever.

362
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
Okay.

363
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
I can't forget.

364
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Everything is like a dream.

365
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,740
The wind is blowing.

366
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,740
Wait a minute.

367
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,740
What's the famous exam today?

368
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Such a big battle.

369
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740
It's not for showing off your love for us.

370
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
Little Xie Lishuang.

371
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
You are the daughter of the Duanzhu tribe.

372
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
We are helping you.

373
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
This is what we should do.

374
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
Look.

375
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
I'm different from her.

376
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
You are our relationship.

377
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Even if you are not the daughter of the Duanzhu tribe,

378
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
I'll come to you like you.

379
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
You're the one who can talk.

380
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
This is...

381
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
My good friend.

382
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,740
Your good friend?

383
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Why haven't I seen him before?

384
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
I'm the name of the wine,

385
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
the name of the night,

386
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
the owner of the capital,

387
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
I come to Guangping to do business.

388
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
The owner of the capital?

389
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Then you speak in a very local way.

390
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
To do business

391
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,740
and to live in the same place as here,

392
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
the business is far away.

393
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
The merchants are not going to go ahead

394
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
when they arrive in the capital.

395
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,740
It's rare to come to Guangping City.

396
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,740
Youhuang.

397
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
We are here to eat.

398
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
We are not here to investigate.

399
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Don't bother him.

400
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
I'm Wenjian,

401
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
from the capital of Guangping.

402
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,740
This is my colleague, Chu Youhuang.

403
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
I'm from the capital.

404
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
I'm from the capital.

405
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Oh, right.

406
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,740
I have a guest to introduce to you.

407
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,740
This is our personal official,

408
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,740
the name of the Sima.

409
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
He is from the capital of the Sima.

410
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
He came to my house to work.

411
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,740
He is the boss of me and Youhuang.

412
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Look.

413
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,740
You haven't seen Sima before, right?

414
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,740
Yes.

415
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
I haven't seen her.

416
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Don't listen to him.

417
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,740
He is a smart and generous official.

418
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
He is a good person.

419
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,740
I'm Chu Youhuang's friend.

420
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
You can call me Lingying.

421
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,740
Hello, Lingying.

422
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
Well, we...

423
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
Sit down.

424
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Sit down.

425
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
Here.

426
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Please come in.

427
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
You go first.

428
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
Wait a minute.

429
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,740
I think there is a hot pot of meat.

430
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Can we prepare a barbecue?

431
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,740
Is the barbecue in Huangcun enough?

432
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
Brother Jiu,

433
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
you are a man of knowledge.

434
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
Our barbecue in Huangcun

435
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
is my favorite.

436
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
New clothes.

437
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
How is it?

438
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,740
Is it good?

439
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,740
It's good.

440
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,740
It's good.

441
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
How is it?

442
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Is it good?

443
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Who did you call me?

444
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Xueyi.

445
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,740
You know each other?

446
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
What is he?

447
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
He...

448
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,740
I don't think he is a good man.

449
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Why do you ask him?

450
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
He asks for my lady.

451
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
I don't ask him

452
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
to exchange for anything.

453
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
I just met him.

454
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I just met him.

455
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
After my father and wife come back,

456
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
I will be mad.

457
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I will bring it to you.

458
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,740
Here you are.

459
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
This is for you.

460
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
Come and sit down.

461
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
It smells good.

462
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
Brother Jiu.

463
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
I want to buy some.

464
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Have a look.

465
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,740
Brother Jiu,

466
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,740
how long have you been in Guangping?

467
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,740
Do you still want to stay here?

468
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
It's been a while.

469
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
But I'm almost done.

470
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,740
I'm leaving now.

471
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
Brother Jiu.

472
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I heard that the city has been in a big trouble

473
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
for the past two years.

474
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,220
The government is only

475
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,740
paying the bills.

476
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
Is Jiu's hometown in trouble?

477
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
It's been difficult these years.

478
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
It's not easy for us.

479
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,740
But we can figure it out.

480
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
As long as we stick to it,

481
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
we can do it.

482
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,740
When the day comes

483
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,740
to the end of the world,

484
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,740
we will be in peace.

485
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
You're right.

486
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
The disaster is not just three.

487
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
The first and foremost innovation

488
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,740
in the history of the dynasty

489
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
is the hard work.

490
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,740
It's not a long journey.

491
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
But now,

492
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,740
the days of the Feng Yi family

493
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
are passing by.

494
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,740
It's hard to live with them.

495
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
As long as we stick to it,

496
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
we will have a good result.

497
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Remember,

498
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
we will be in peace.

499
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
You're right.

500
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,740
Come on.

501
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,740
We will be in peace.

502
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
Listen.

503
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
Come and eat.

504
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,740
I'll get the soup.

505
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,740
Come on, Jiu.

506
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
I'll get it for you.

507
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,740
He Xia.

508
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,740
What's your relationship with Jiu?

509
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Don't worry.

510
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
I won't tell your father.

511
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Didn't I say that just now?

512
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
That's not true.

513
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,740
I think you and Jiu

514
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
are not just friends.

515
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,740
What about you?

516
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,740
You and Chu Tan,

517
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
we are friends.

518
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
You and Chu Tan

519
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,740
are just friends.

520
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Ban Jia.

521
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I and the Fourth Master

522
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
are just friends.

523
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Look.

524
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
It's the first time

525
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,740
I've met him.

526
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,740
You're the only one who knows.

527
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Fourth Master.

528
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,740
As I said,

529
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,740
we have many young talents.

530
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,740
Don't waste time on a book.

531
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Come on.

532
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Everyone,

533
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
let me have a toast.

534
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Today, we met Xuan Ye.

535
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
We have a new friend.

536
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,740
Ban Xia is going home safely.

537
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,740
The Fourth Master

538
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
has also transferred to our Guangping mansion.

539
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
He is so strict.

540
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
He is going to have a family and a family.

541
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
You're so mean.

542
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
You're right.

543
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
The Fourth Master is coming.

544
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Come on.

545
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Cheers.

546
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
Come on.

547
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Come on.

548
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Come on.

549
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Come on.

550
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
Come on.

551
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
Come on.

552
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Thank you, Lord Sima.

553
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I brought it for Ban Xia.

554
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
Cheers.

555
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,740
Eight bottles of beer.

556
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,740
You and Chu Tan,

557
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
come to have a meal.

558
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Good wine.

559
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Drink.

560
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,740
Drink wine.

561
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,740
Yes.

562
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,740
Lord Sima,

563
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
why do you drink wine?

564
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
Xuan Ye.

565
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,740
Come on.

566
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
Let's have a drink.

567
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,740
Cheers.

568
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,740
Good, brother.

569
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,740
The Fourth Master.

570
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Cheers.

571
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,740
Cheers.

572
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
Why is Dr. Jiu here?

573
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,740
I heard the yard was so lively.

574
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,740
I didn't expect you to be here.

575
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
Little brother,

576
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
I have something to ask you.

577
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Who are you?

578
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,740
Father.

579
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
You suffered.

580
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,740
After I saw you,

581
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
I was so heartbroken.

582
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
I knew

583
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,740
that the long sword was used.

584
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,740
It was also related to you.

585
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Either

586
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,740
it was me who used the long sword for you,

587
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
or

588
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
you used the long sword for me.

589
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
But no matter what,

590
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
you must be related to me.

591
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,740
Will you stay in Guangping?

592
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
No.

593
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
My father passed away.

594
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,740
I was so worried

595
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,740
that I was afraid of the grass and the grass.

596
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,740
I was afraid of the wild animals.

597
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
I had to control myself.

598
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,740
I couldn't do it.

599
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
When did you close the door?

600
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I was in the clouds.

601
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,740
I didn't have time for a day.

602
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
See you next time.

603
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,740
It's been twelve years.

604
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,740
How did you come to the two realms?

605
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
This is called a peach.

606
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,740
It can be used as a two-year-old sword.

607
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,740
But I used too much.

608
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,740
It's gone.

609
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Is there only one?

610
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Yes.

611
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
What should we do

612
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
about the little girl in the Duan family?

613
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,740
Everyone has his or her own responsibility.

614
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,740
We have to force it.

615
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,740
The long sword is a base.

616
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,740
You shouldn't have taken it.

617
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
But the little girl

618
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
still remembers everything.

619
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
Now it seems

620
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
that it's not just a master.

621
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,740
It's a master.

622
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,740
The British are in trouble.

623
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,740
You and your brother

624
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
don't let them know.

625
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
You and your brother

626
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
don't let them know.

627
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
You and your brother are getting married next month.

628
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,740
You can't do it.

629
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,740
Yes.

630
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,740
That's it.

631
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,740
Do what you should do.

632
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,740
Maybe one day

633
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,740
we can meet again.

634
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Dad.

635
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,740
Xuan Yi

636
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,740
Thanks for your kindness.

637
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Zhang Zhen

638
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,740
I evaluate you for yourself.

639
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,740
What are you hiding?

640
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,740
We have our own things.

641
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,740
We have our own differences.

642
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,740
We have our own differences.

643
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,740
Enough.

644
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,740
I'm afraid I can't drink with you this time.

645
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,740
I'll drink this as a gift for you.

646
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,740
Thank you.

647
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,740
This gift can't be taken away.

648
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,740
This marriage is...

649
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
I'm sorry.

650
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,740
I'm sorry.

651
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,740
I'm sorry.

652
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,740
I'm sorry.

653
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,740
I'm sorry.

654
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,740
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
I'm sorry.

657
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,740
I have to think about it.

658
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,740
Sister Sima, don't worry.

659
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
This gift is for you.

660
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,740
If you and someone else get married,

661
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,740
send me a request.

662
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,740
Okay.

663
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,740
Xun Yi, Bai Xia.

664
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,740
We'll meet again soon.

665
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,740
Next time, come to my mansion.

666
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
I'll go.

667
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,740
Take care.

668
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Take care.

669
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,740
Take care.

670
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Thank you, Bai Xia.

671
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,740
Take care.

672
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Thank you, Bai Xia.

673
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Goodbye, Mr. Zhao.

674
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,740
Goodbye, take care.

675
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,740
Is your gift heavy?

676
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,740
How about I help you?

677
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,740
No.

678
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Why don't you show me inside?

679
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Bai Xia gave me a gift

680
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,740
for you and someone else.

681
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
I'm leaving.

682
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Xun Yi,

683
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,740
take care of your master.

684
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Take care of your mother.

685
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,740
Don't make them angry.

686
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,740
And practice martial arts.

687
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,740
Don't run away if you can't fight.

688
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,740
Don't be so strong.

689
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,740
Take care.

690
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,740
Okay, I'll go.

691
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,740
Search for me.

692
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,740
I'll go out.

693
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,740
Xun Yi,

694
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
is Wu You Jing big?

695
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,740
It's big.

696
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,740
It's like a human.

697
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,740
It's a wide-spread land,

698
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,740
with a beautiful mountain and a sea of sweat.

699
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,740
The place of the sky and the earth

700
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
is just a entrance to Wu You Jing.

701
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
If you go further,

702
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,740
it's the place of countless demons.

703
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,740
Where do you live?

704
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,740
The place of those strong demons

705
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,740
is the ice.

706
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,740
It's windy and snowy.

707
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,740
It's a lake with a lot of salt.

708
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,740
The lake is a capital city.

709
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,740
That city is the place of the Xuan Bao Clan.

710
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,740
Mr. Chao.

711
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,740
It's a long way.

712
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,740
The moon is so beautiful today.

713
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,740
Is there a moon in Wu You Jing?

714
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,740
Yes.

715
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,740
That's good.

716
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,740
Even if we stay away from it,

717
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,740
the first time I see it is the same moon.

718
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,740
Yes.

719
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,740
Yes.

720
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,740
I'll give you this.

721
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,740
Okay.

722
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,740
Take care.

723
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,740
I will.

724
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,740
You too.

725
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,740
I'll go first.

726
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,740
I'll go first.

727
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,740
I'll go first.

728
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,740
The night is so long.

729
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,740
The night is so long.

730
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,740
There is a long way to go.

731
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,740
The long way to love.

732
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,740
The long way to love.

733
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,740
Who knows

734
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,740
who will give you the heart?

735
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,740
The long way to love.

736
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,740
The long way to love.

737
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,740
Chen Ye.

738
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,740
In Wu You Jing,

739
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,740
what is the name of the river we live in?

740
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,740
It's called Wu You Du.

741
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,740
Wu You Du?

742
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,740
Yes.

743
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,740
It's a beautiful river.

744
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,740
It's a beautiful river.

745
