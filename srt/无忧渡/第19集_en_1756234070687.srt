Big Brother.

4
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,920
Are you hurt?

5
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:57,740
Big Brother?

6
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,340
Here's some advice:

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
when you speak to someone,

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,350
think twice

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,520
before acting like you're top dog.

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,680
What are you waiting for?

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,110
Help Big Brother up.

12
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,169
Alright, alright.

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,540
What happened?

14
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,360
Why are you here?

15
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,470
Hey.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,430
Big Brother.

17
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,430
Are you a-alright?

Big Brother.

19
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,000
What's wrong with you?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,150
This is the home of the four of us brothers.

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,750
Where else could we be

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
if not here?

23
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,550
Four brothers?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,060
What are you doing?

25
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,800
Third Brother.

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Do you think Big Brother

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
hit his head when he fell?

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,640
Even if it is brain damage,

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,640
it doesn't have much to do with the falling, actually.

30
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,630
Naughty.

Fine!

Everything here is originated from ink.

After getting this done,

86
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,830
you'll have enough money saved

87
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,950
to get married.

88

Besides,

a wedding is a big deal.

106

If we ruin it for them,

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,070
they'll become our enemies.

108
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,310
The four of us won't be able

109

I won't.

Why can't I apply force?

Do it.

122
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,130
Alright.

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,720
Stop it, Big Brother.

124

Behave yourself.

136
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,070
Don't act out of impulse.

137
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,890

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,480
Bride! Bride!

197
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,910
Bride! Bride!

198
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,440
It's said that the bride is grounding the rouge under the candle.

199
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,960
She's getting ready in front of the mirror.

200
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,040
She doesn't have to put on the entire makeup.

201
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,150
Keep her eyebrows undone for me to get them drawn.

202
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,180
Bravo!

203
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,880
Get on the sedan chair at the auspicious hour to celebrate your wedding.

204
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,080
May the couple live happily ever after.

205
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,000
The perfect marriage is a match made in heaven.

206
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,850
The couple will live happily in harmony.

207
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,750
Let go.

208
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,720
Let go.

209
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,860
Big Brother! Big Brother!

210
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,990
How inappropriate!

211
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,430
So out of line.

212
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,270
My Lady, slowly.

213
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,360
Be careful.

214
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
Sit tight.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,790
Quelian is in good hands with me.

216
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,990
Please rest assured.

217
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,030
I'll take my leave.

218
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,480
Dear son-in-law.

219
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,250
Take care.

220
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,910
So now, Youhuang, I,

221
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,390
and those three brothers

222
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,720
are all in the painting.

223
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,360
Then

224
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,080
Banxia should be here too.

225
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,730
Congratulations.

226
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,210
Congratulations.

227
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,730
Congratulations.

228
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,470
It's supposed to be a happy wedding day.

229
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,120
How unlucky.

230
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,670
Exactly.

231
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,290
What's going on?

232
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,790
My Lord.

233
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,860
A few days ago,

234
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,000
I heard that the Old Master of the Sun family

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,600
was dying.

236
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,600
Looks like

237
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,990
we've run into them.

238
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,630
What bad luck.

239
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,510
Crossing paths with a funeral procession

240
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,870
on his wedding day.

241
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,870
It's quite a weird incident.

242
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,000
Perhaps it can become something

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,440
as famous as the Six Wonders of Guangping in the future.

244
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,390
You went to Blind Liu for fortune-telling,

245
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,720
and you got me this date?

246
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,600
Well...

247
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,840
Bride.

248
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,400
We ran into a funeral procession.

249
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,210
We won't be able to advance

250
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,440
for the time being anyway.

251
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,700
Do you want to come out for some fresh air?

252
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,130
Are you insane?

253
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,910
Which sedan bearers' place are you from?

254
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,910
What’s your name?

255
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
My name is Xuanye.

256
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,920
Big Brother. Big Brother.

257
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,380
Your name is Damao. Damao.

258
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,390
You brat.

259
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,660
I'll remember you.

260
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't even think about

261
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,560
working in this business again.

262
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,690
Please don't say that.

263
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,380
Calm down.

264
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,540
Calm down, please.

265
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,840
Thank you.

266
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,240
Congratulations.

267
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,600
Please drink to your heart's content tonight.

268
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,440
Sure.

269
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,790
Congratulations.

270
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,380
Congratulations, My Lord.

271
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,020
Thank you.

272
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,300
Stop the sedan!

273
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,810
[Huang Residence]

274
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,630
Lower the sedan!

275
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,190
Look at the bride.

276
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,970
Welcome the bride!

277
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,040
What are you doing? Get out of the way.

278
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,690
My Lady.

279
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,930
It's time to get off the sedan.

280
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,750
My Lady, please be careful.

281
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,570
The bride crosses the saddle,

282
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,450
and the household will be in peace forever.

283
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,450
What happened just now?

284
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,060
It was nothing.

285
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
We ran into a scoundrel.

286
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,930
Big Brother.

287
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,290
We have to take the back door to get the reward money.

288
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,670
The front door is not for us.

289
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,510
Stop it.

290
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,390
Everyone.

291
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,850
Today is a day of great joy for the Huang Residence.

292
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,670
Master said there will be rewards for everyone.

293
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,510
Come with me to the backyard to collect the rewards

294
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,790
and have some wedding candies.

295
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,150
We are lucky to be here today.

296
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,510
Not only can we get the rewards,

297
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,750
but we can also join the wedding banquet.

298
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,440
Let's go.

299
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,800
Can you stop carrying me like this?

300
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,300
Okay, Brother.

301
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
What's the point of this?

302
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,550
May you and your wife live happily ever after, My Lord.

303
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,080
Good.

304
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,020
Reward him.

305
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,310
May you have a baby soon, My Lord.

306
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,480
Not bad. Give him a reward too.

307
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay, thank you.

308
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,150
Next.

309
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,330
May you grow old together.

310
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,030
Good. Bravo.

311
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,200
Next.

312
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,640
Eternal love.

313
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,870
Reward.

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,030
Get a wedding candy, too.

315
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,600
Take it.

316
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,790
Thank you.

317
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,360
Next.

318
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,750
Wish you and your wife...

319
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,070
A happy birthday, My Lord!

320
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,780
I'll let you off this time.

321
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,580
Come on.

322
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,870
Next.

323
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,550
May you and your wife live happily ever after

324
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,000
and have a baby soon, My Lord.

325
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,510
Good.

326
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,600
Well said.

327
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,670
The bride is here.

328
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,670
The bride is here.

329
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
The bride is here.

330
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,840
Look into the mirror and bow.

331
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,170
The couple becomes one.

332
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,410
Evil spirits shall be exorcised forever.

333
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
The first kowtow is for

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,270
growing old together,

335
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,800
and living in harmony like lovebirds.

336
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,000
The second kowtow is for

337
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,720
expressing gratitude to your parents for raising you,

338
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,380
and wishing them good health.

339
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,030
The third kowtow is for

340
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,490
a harmonious marital life

341
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,080
and being united as one.

342
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,840
Banxia.

343
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,290
It's really you.

344
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,390
It's you again!

345
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,510
You're really out of your mind, you brat.

346
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,370
How dare you harass Her Ladyship?

347
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,150
You'll be in for it

348
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,510
after His Lordship finishes his business today.

349
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:01,960
Let's go.

350
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,490
Let's go.

351
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,120
This bearer is really bold.

352
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,480
He even dared to harass Her Ladyship.

353
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,030
Exactly.

354
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,410
He deserves to be detained here for days.

355
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,730
Brother.

356
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,600
They were saying

357
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,840
a bearer was arrested.

358
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,000
A-Aren't we

359
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,510
the b-bearers?

360
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,200
Right.

361
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,240
Third Brother.

362
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,170
Fourth Brother.

363
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,120
Second Brother.

364
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Where is Big Brother?

365
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh no.

366
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
So Big Brother was arrested.

367
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Big...

368
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,750
Something happened to Big Brother.

369
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,910
Go look for him!

370
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,960
Are you stupid?

371
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,240
Second Brother.

372
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,369
Big Brother is here.

373
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,510
Damao!

374
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,210
Big Brother!

375
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,240
Big Brother!

376
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,569
We're here to save you.

377
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,000
Find a way to open the door.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,829
Okay.

379
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,590
Why don't we kick it open with our feet, Second Brother?

380
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,030
Big Brother! Stay clear.

381
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,320
Big Brother.

382
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,830
Did they hit you?

383
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,060
Big Brother, does it hurt?

384
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,680
Are you alright?

385
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,590
I'm alright. I'm alright.

386
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,920
Let's go!

387
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,830
Let's go.

388
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,480
But...

389
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,440
Let's go.

390
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,350
Brother.

391
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,400
You guys go first.

392
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
I still have something to do.

393
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,240
Where are you going?

394
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,050
This has nothing to do with you.

395
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,200
Go home first.

396
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,720
Big Brother is going to make a scene in the bridal chamber.

397
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,850
Big Brother asked us

398
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,350
to wait here

399
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,200
or go home.

400
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,750
But

401
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,950
what if Big Brother gets arrested again

402
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,160
later?

403
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,610
What should we do then?

404
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,690
We might as well

405
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,030
save him again.

406
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,030
My Lady.

407
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,390
Don't overthink it.

408
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,520
His Lordship has arrested

409
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,250
that madman.

410
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,910
He won't let him off easily.

411
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,320
My Lady, have some water.

412
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,840
Are you hungry, My Lady?

413
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
Do you want something to eat?

414
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,230
I haven't eaten all day. Of course I'm hungry.

415
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,020
I'll go get some nuts

416
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,980
for you, My Lady.

417
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,870
Wait for a moment, My Lady.

418
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,930
I'll be right back.

419
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,350
You again?

420
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,990
You don't remember me?

421
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,350
Right.

422
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,270
You must have forgotten too.

423
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,040
Otherwise,

424
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,200
you wouldn't have married Youhuang.

425
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,160
I don't have the time

426
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,240
to explain everything to you now.

427
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,920
Come with me.

428
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,180
Don't come any closer!

429
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,030
Stay away from me.

430
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,650
Are you leaving or not?

431
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,240
If you don't leave now,

432
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,510
this won't just be thrown on the ground, got it?

433
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,610
Calm down.

434
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,830
I have no ill intentions towards you.

435
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,510
I won't hurt you.

436
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,770
Are you leaving or not?

437
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,750
I haven't finished yet.

438
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,890
I'm not leaving.

439
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,510
Let me explain.

440
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,350
What you see

441
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,070
with your eyes right now

442
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,680
is all fake,

443
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,790
except me.

444
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,640
We are now

445
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,880
trapped in a painting.

446
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,810
I'm here to help you get out of here.

447
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,880
You'd better think about

448
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,310
how you can get out yourself first.

449
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,970
Hey, you...

450
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,580
It's you again.

451
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,910
Youhuang.

452
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,990
Listen to me.

453
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,090
Don't be afraid, Honey. I'm here.

454
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,070
How dare you.

455
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
You failed to ruin my wedding,

456
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,780
so you broke into my bridal chamber

457
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,210
and even tried to molest my wife.

458
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,880
I should have killed you just now!

459
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,010
You misunderstood.

460
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,240
The relationship between you two is not

461
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
what you think it is.

462
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
You're blinded.

463
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,700
I misunderstood?

464
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,520
Our relationship is not what it seems to be?

465
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,070
What do you scoundrel

466
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,920
intend to do!

467
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
It's not like that.

468
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,240
Wake up!

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,110
I wake up?

470
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,930
I'll help you wake up first!

471
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,930
Big Brother.

472
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,030
Are you hurt?

473
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,830
What are you waiting for?

474
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,550
Help Big Brother up.

475
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,480
Why were you so careless?

476
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,500
What happened?

477
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,830
Why are you here?

478
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,610
We... We were just talking about

479
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
getting to work.

480
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,080
Big Brother.

481
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,360
What's wrong with you?

482
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,720
This is the home of the four of us brothers.

483
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,240
Where else could we be

484
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,110
if not here?

485
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,170
Four brothers?

486
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,440
Sanmao.

487
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,590
Do you think

488
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
Big Brother hit his head?

489
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,030
Even if it is brain damage,

490
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,630
I don't think it has much to do with the falling.

491
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,890
He's just naughty like that.

492
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,650
Brother, we need to get to work.

493
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
It's almost time.

494
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,050
We still have a full day's work ahead of us.

495
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,310
Let's go, Big Brother.

496
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,750
W-Where are you going, Big Brother?

497
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,130
Where are you going?

498
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,000
Damao.

499
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,150
Are you going to the street to buy steamed buns?

500
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,930
Enjoy your meal.

501
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,830
Damao!

502
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,510
Damao!

503
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,280
Freshly steamed meat buns.

504
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,270
I haven't even got a chance

505
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,400
to take them out yet.

506
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,720
20 buns as usual...

507
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,550
Damao.

508
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,240
20 buns as usual?

509
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,550
Damao.

510
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,640
Come here and have some pancakes.

511
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
Come here and have some pancakes.

512
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,830
They have both vegetables and meat inside.

513
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,480
Eat it with a bowl of

514
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,410
warm meat broth.

515
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,100
I guarantee

516
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,420
you won't have to eat another meal today.

517
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,410
Look up.

518
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,410
Open your eyes.

519
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,590
The Six Wonders of Guangping are magnificent.

520
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,550
The grand mountains,

521
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,510
the gorgeous blossoms.

522
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,000
The century-old pride and grace peak at the present.

523
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,840
Recite it again.

524
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,690
Look up.

525
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,680
Open your eyes.

526
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
The Six Wonders of Guangping are magnificent.

527
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,750
The grand mountains,

528
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,810
the gorgeous blossoms.

529
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,520
Big Brother!

530
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,350
What's the urgent matter?

531
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,670
Why did you run so fast?

532
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,590
That's right.

533
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,790
We have to finish this job

534
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,960
no matter what the urgent matter is.

535
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,750
After we get this work done,

536
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,890
you'll have enough money to get married.

537
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,760
Third Brother, you're right.

538
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,440
After we have enough money saved

539
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,660
and help Big Brother get married,

540
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,340
I will be next.

541
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,790
Then Third Brother.

542
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,720
I'll be the last.

543
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,720
I have something important to do.

544
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,850
You guys get to work.

545
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,660
I have to go.

546
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,000
Big Brother.

547
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Let's finish our work first.

548
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,070
When we come back,

549
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,870
we'll help you with your matter.

550
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,690
Big Brother.

551
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,550
We've already taken the deposit for this job.

552
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,330
Where do you expect them to find people to replace us

553
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,770
if we quit now?

554
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,960
It'll be a big deal

555
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,780
if we delay their wedding.

556
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,590
People will talk behind our backs

557
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,520
in the future.

558
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,090
Third... Third Brother is right.

559
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,370
Third Brother.

560
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,830
Wait! Wait!

561
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,960
Hold on. Hold on.

562
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:09,890
Look!

563
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,500
What are we supposed to see?

564
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,230
I don't know.

565
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,140
I don't know.

566
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,790
-Big Brother.
-Where's Big Brother?

567
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,390
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

568
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,450
Everyone.

569
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,200
Here.

570
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,050
Pass the wedding candies

571
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,860
around.

572
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,360
Please share in the joy.

573
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,480
Congratulations.

574
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,350
Thank you.

575
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,140
Where are the bearers?

576
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,790
I didn't see them

577
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,880
when I came this morning.

578
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
What are you waiting for?

579
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,680
Go look for them immediately.

580
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,240
Go!

581
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,880
Hurry up.

582
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,590
Help us look for them. Hurry.

583
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,160
My Lord, here.

584
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,960
The hat

585
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,290
must be worn straight.

586
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,350
When you mount and dismount the horse,

587
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,110
keep your back

588
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,240
upright.

589
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,030
Let others see

590
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,440
how handsome you are.

591
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,810
The wedding etiquette

592
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
is very complicated,

593
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,730
so I've repeated it a few times.

594
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,550
Please don't mind my nagging, My Lord.

595
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,380
I know.

596
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,080
Who are you?

597
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,910
Who let you in?

598
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,960
I just want to have a word with you,

599
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,090
and then I'll leave.

600
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,310
Trust me.

601
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,750
You may leave.

602
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,120
Yes.

603
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,730
Today is my wedding day.

604
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
I'm in a good mood.

605
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,160
Just tell me what you want.

606
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
Why make such a fuss?

607
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,160
I don't need this.

608
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,830
I just hope

609
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,020
you can listen carefully

610
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,350
to what I'm about to say.

611
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,400
Okay.

612
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,790
Go ahead.

613
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,440
My real name is Jiu Xuanye.

614
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,830
Jiu Xuanye.

615
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm a demon hunter from Ganshan Clinic.

616
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
Your real surname is not Huang.

617
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,120
You're just a constable.

618
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,310
Your surname is Chu,

619
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,880
and your first name is Youhuang.

620
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Chu Youhuang.

621
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,190
This is not Guangping City.

622
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,640
This is just a bookstore

623
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,700
in the Underground City.

624
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,830
The owner of this bookstore

625
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,510
is a demon who is good at drawing.

626
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,400
This Guangping City is only

627
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,960
a city in his painting.

628
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,830
Demon?

629
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,240
Right.

630
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,310
You didn't believe any of these before, either.

631
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,440
Only after you saw

632
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,360
the Mirror Demon

633
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,110
escaped from your sword with your own eyes

634
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,720
did you start to believe that

635
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,850
there really are demons in this world.

636
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
Is that so?

637
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,240
Now,

638
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,440
we are not the only two

639
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,750
trapped in this painting,

640
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,610
Banxia is, too.

641
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,340
She's that

642
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,000
young lady from the martial arts school

643
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,460
who you're about to marry.

644
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,000
The three brothers who are going to carry the sedan chair

645
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,330
together with me are trapped here as well.

646
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,440
How is it?

647
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,000
Do you recall anything?

648
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,510
No.

649
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,270
So, you're doubting

650
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,720
what I said just now?

651
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,240
Isn't it obvious enough?

652
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,350
Although...

653
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,680
Although I haven't figured out

654
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,200
the rules

655
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
in this painting yet,

656
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,040
I can

657
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,330
prove one thing to you.

658
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,980
This was left to me by my grandfather!

659
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,310
It's all fake.

660
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,200
Do you even know

661
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,260
what you are doing?

662
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,260
I'm trying to prove to you

663
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,970
that in this painting,

664
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,240
everything that's destroyed

665
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,710
will return to its original form,

666
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,970
which is this ink mark!

667
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,840
Do you understand now?

668
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,480
Yes.

669
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,510
I understand now.

670
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,040
You understand?

671
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,690
So,

672
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,570
what do you plan to do next?

673
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,660
Guards!

674
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,440
Arrest him!

675
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,600
What are you doing?

676
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,400
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

677
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,730
Madam, come in, please.

678
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay.

679
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,200
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang.

680
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,030
Please.

681
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Have some tea.

682
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,750
It's him!

683
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,900
Let's see where you can escape this time.

684
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,480
Why is it so noisy outside?

685
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,440
What happened?

686
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,400
A sedan bearer from the Huang Residence

687
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,590
climbed over the wall and sneaked in just now.

688
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,200
My Lady.

689
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,040
He seemed to be here for you.

690
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,400
A bearer?

691
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,370
You know him, My Lady?

692
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,890
How could I?

693
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,350
My Lady.

694
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,200
It's almost auspicious hour.

695
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,240
Are you ready?

696
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes.

697
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,920
Here.

698
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,920
Stay here and behave yourself!

699
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,440
Let's go.

700
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,970
Let's go.

701
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,910
Look into the mirror and bow.

702
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,250
The couple becomes one.

703
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,590
Evil spirits shall be exorcised forever.

704
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,640
The first kowtow is for

705
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,900
growing old together,

706
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,500
and living in harmony like lovebirds.

707
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,920
The second kowtow is for

708
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,000
expressing your gratitude to your parents for raising you,

709
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,660
and wishing them good health.

710
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,290
The third kowtow is for

711
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,830
a harmonious marital life

712
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,530
and being united as one.

713
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,140
Tie a knot and finish the make-up.

714
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,160
Join hands and enter the bridal chamber.

715
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,590
One.

716
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,830
Two.

717
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,830
Three.

718
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,560
Big Brother.

719
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,440
Are you hurt?

720
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,310
What are you waiting for?

721
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,720
Help Big Brother up.

722
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Move your feet.

723
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,510
Hurry.

724
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,350
What's wrong with you, Big Brother?

725
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,240
You look unwell, Big Brother.

726
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,970
Did you h-hurt yourself somewhere, Big Brother?

727
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,170
Big Brother.

728
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,750
How about I get you a doctor?

729
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,030
Big Brother, say something.

730
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,030
Don't scare us.

731
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,440
Am I your Big Brother?

732
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,480
Yes.

733
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,170
Will you listen to me or not?

734
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,240
Yes.

735
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,690
When mother died,

736
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,160
she told us all to listen to Big Brother.

737
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
We listen to Big Brother since Mother has passed away.

738
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
We'll listen to Second Brother if Big Brother dies.

739
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,270
Big Brother is not dead yet.

740
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,550
So we still listen to Big Brother now.

741
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,610
Alright. Alright.

742
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,040
I have a favor

743
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,960
to ask you now.

744
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,890
Will you help me?

745
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,590
Sure.

746
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,740
Big Brother.

747
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,880
What kind of talk is this?

748
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,040
We are brothers.

749
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,350
What do you mean do you a favor?

750
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,070
If you need anything,

751
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,680
just let us know.

752
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,690
Exactly.

753
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,830
If we brothers are of the same mind,

754
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,920
our strength will be sharp enough to cut through...

755
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,980
Cut through metal.

756
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,200
Good!

757
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,790
Here's the thing.

758
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,640
There's something

759
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,690
I've been keeping to myself

760
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
and haven't told you.

761
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,120
And I've been hesitating

762
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,240
whether I should tell you or not.

763
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,970
Big Brother.

764
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,270
Just say it.

765
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,440
Okay.

766
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Here's the thing.

767
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,420
I went out

768
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,920
a few days ago.

769
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,900
When I was out...

770
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,040
Big Brother.

771
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,270
When did you go out?

772
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,270
I don't remember.

773
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,070
Right.

774
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,530
We were sleeping at home that day.

775
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,270
Listen to me.

776
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,070
I went out

777
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
a few days ago.

778
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,770
I first went south,

779
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,070
and then I went north.

780
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,720
Anyway,

781
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,920
I met a girl.

782
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,590
After I met that girl...

783
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,210
So it turns out

784
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,200
Big Brother met a girl he likes.

785
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,400
Big Brother has fallen in love.

786
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,730
He's got a story to tell.

787
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,880
-Naughty.
-Story.

788
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,570
Looks like you are not that stupid after all.

789
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,400
Big Brother, after all,

790
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,280
where is that girl from?

791
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,830
Which city?

792
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
She's a local, from Guangping City.

793
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,470
What a coincidence.

794
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,160
Exactly.

795
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,350
What a coincidence.

796
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,410
We are familiar with Guangping City.

797
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,510
Which family is she from?

798
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,750
What's her surname?

799
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Let's go find her.

800
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,350
She's the girl from the martial arts school.

801
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,010
Martial...

802
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,790
Martial...

803
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,550
Martial...

804
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,720
Stop imitating me.

805
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,660
Shut up.

806
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,560
Which martial arts school?

807
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Which martial arts school can it be?

808
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,680
He...

809
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,810
He's Martial Arts School?

810
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,680
Yes.

811
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,400
Isn't that

812
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,890
the bride

813
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,830
we're going to pick up later?

814
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:25,750
Yes.

815
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,370
Are you out of your mind, Big Brother?

816
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,000
Do you know

817
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,090
who her husband is?

818
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,920
He's famous for his fierceness.

819
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
Back when he went to suppress bandits on the mountain,

820
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,300
he killed a dozen bandits

821
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,750
all by himself.

822
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,440
He's murderous.

823
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,440
Big Brother.

824
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,570
He's really brutal.

825
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,020
Are you scared?

826
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,030
So you aren't going to

827
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,690
help your Big Brother, right?

828
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,830
You've forgotten

829
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,960
what your mother told you, right?

830
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,000
I... I...

831
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,310
I-I'm not scared.

832
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,720
Brother, you are scared.

833
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,330
You are more or less...

834
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,090
Shut up!

835
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,290
We are not bandits.

836
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,350
Even if we are caught,

837
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,160
we won't die.

838
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
In short,

839
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,520
will you

840
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,610
kidnap the bride

841
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,350
with your Big Brother or not?

842
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,440
I...

843
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,150
Good brothers.

844
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,150
Are In the heart.

845
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,330
We are brothers. We are the closest people in this world.

846
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,389
What about you two?

847
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,030
Brother.

848
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,730
The atmosphere has reached this point.

849
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:29,889
Well,

850
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,929
we'll go too.

851
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,800
Good!

852
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,320
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

853
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,190
If we brothers are of the same mind,

854
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,710
our strength will be sharp enough to cut through...

855
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,310
Metal!

856
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,090
Congratulations.

857
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,409
Congratulations.

858
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,000
Congratulations.

859
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,199
Thank you, thank you.

860
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,070
Congratulations, Lord Huang.

861
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,130
Congratulations.

862
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,960
Congratulations, Lord Huang.

863
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,710
Thank you.

864
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,550
Congratulations, Lord Huang.

865
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,449
Thank you.

866
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,000
Congratulations.

867
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,180
Wait a bit longer.

868
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,570
Congratulations.

869
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,820
Stop!

870
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,800
Get ready.

871
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,980
Hold tight.

872
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,000
Run!

873
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,140
What happened?

874
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,000
What are they doing?

875
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,260
They're running away.

876
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,400
Where are they taking the sedan chair?

877
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,670
What's going on?

878
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,000
Have those four guys

879
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,860
never seen a funeral procession?

880
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,280
Quelian?

881
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,590
Quelian!

882
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,630
Make way!

883
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Make way!

884
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,400
What kind of people are they?

885
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,190
Watch out!

886
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,310
Stop, stop!

887
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,330
Stop!

888
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Who are you guys?

889
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,110
You kidnapped me during my wedding in broad daylight.

890
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,110
Do you wish to die?

891
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,010
Sit tight.

892
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,230
I'll explain to you later.

893
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,710
Okay?

894
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,600
Let's go!

895
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,850
Brother.

896
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,930
She smells so good.

897
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,080
She's asleep.

898
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,570
Big Brother is asleep too.

899
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,930
Do you think Big Brother is tired?

900
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,670
Who's asleep?

901
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,880
Big Brother, you're awake.

902
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,390
Shut up.

903
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,750
You woke Big Brother up.

904
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,590
Let's go out.

905
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,380
Let's go.

906
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,840
Go.

907
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,680
You're awake.

908
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Where am I?

909
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,590
This is just a shack.

910
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,550
Why did you bring me here?

911
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,230
Those from the Huang Residence

912
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,960
won't be able to find us for now.

913
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,320
You are alone?

914
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,850
Where are your accomplices?

915
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
They are outside.

916
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,060
So,

917
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,000
are you trying to rob me

918
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,150
or kill me?

919
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Neither.

920
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,960
So you want to molest me?

921
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,840
Do you have any other questions

922
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,700
you want to ask?

923
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,960
If not,

924
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,580
just listen to me.

925
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,230
What I'm about to say

926
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,120
might sound unbelievable

927
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,340
and nonsensical to you.

928
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,180
But I swear,

929
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,760
everything I say is true.

930
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,190
I hope you can listen patiently to

931
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,790
what I say,

932
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,150
and then decide

933
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,310
whether to believe me or not.

934
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,890
Okay?

935
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,810
Did you two h-hear...

936
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,000
That's about it.

937
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,510
So you mean,

938
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,250
my real surname is not He.

939
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,590
My surname is Duan, and my full name is Duan Banxia?

940
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,070
Yes.

941
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,600
My current parents

942
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,160
are not my real parents.

943
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,230
My husband

944
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,920
is not my real husband either.

945
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,030
That's right.

946
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,760
I...

947
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,800
We are trapped in a painting.

948
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,180
This painting

949
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,960
was drawn by a demon.

950
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,960
Yes. Right.

951
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,740
Do you think I believe you?

952
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,810
Are you willing to believe me?

953
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,880
Although what you said

954
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,010
sounds ridiculous,

955
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,880
for some reason,

956
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,600
I just feel like

957
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,880
I should believe you.

958
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,800
According to what you said,

959
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,730
when I think about it carefully...

960
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,670
Indeed.

961
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,480
When I woke up this morning,

962
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,280
I had a headache.

963
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,750
I felt dizzy and groggy,

964
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,720
like I was dreaming.

965
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,800
Yes. That's right.

966
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,930
I was like that on the first day as well.

967
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,760
And

968
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,410
many things I did

969
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,950
felt familiar.

970
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,200
They just felt somewhat familiar to me.

971
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,850
I think

972
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,630
you should be able to restore your memory

973
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,710
very soon.

974
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,640
But even if

975
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,030
I recall everything,

976
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,510
we still don't know

977
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,550
how to get out.

978
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,230
Actually,

979
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,570
I've thought about it carefully.

980
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,960
This painting

981
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,550
should be the longest painting

982
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,880
in Enlightenment Bookstore.

983
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,070
It's one of that demon's

984
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,880
best works.

985
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,280
You,

986
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,190
I,

987
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,290
Youhuang,

988
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,190
and the three brothers outside

989
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,050
are all trapped in this painting.

990
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,110
Besides,

991
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,400
your parents

992
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,000
may be trapped here too.

993
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,550
This demon

994
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,890
is so obsessed with your parents that

995
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,430
even after over 10 years,

996
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,960
it still sent Chi Wangchuan

997
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,510
to kidnap your father.

998
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,430
I guess

999
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,740
your parents

1000
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,070
are probably

1001
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,060
the finishing touch of this painting.

1002
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,340
They are the important characters.

1003
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,630
If we can find your parents,

1004
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,360
we may be able to find a way

1005
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,280
to get out.

1006
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,030
I think you have a point.

1007
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,560
You know what?

1008
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,070
I tried to

1009
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,480
awaken Youhuang before,

1010
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,240
but he didn't believe me at all.

1011
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,480
Fortunately.

1012
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,400
Fortunately, you believe me.

1013
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,550
Of course I believe you.

1014
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,510
It's just that

1015
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,280
I haven't eaten anything

1016
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,300
since this morning.

1017
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,710
Wait for me.

1018
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,280
I'll get you something to eat.

1019
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,630
Okay.

1020
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,630
Full of nonsense.

1021
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,070
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1022
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,920
Big Brother.

1023
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
Are you hurt?

1024
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,590
What are you waiting for?

1025
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,960
Help Big Brother up.

1026
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:42,920
Big Brother.

1027
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,510
What's wrong with you, Big Brother?

1028
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,880
You look unwell, Big Brother.

1029
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,030
Did you h-hurt yourself somewhere?

1030
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,830
Stop talking.

1031
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,780
Leave me alone.

1032
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,690
Big Brother.

1033
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,290
How about I get you a doctor?

1034
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,390
I'm your Big Brother.

1035
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,790
Will you listen to me?

1036
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,440
Sure.

1037
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,460
Congratulations.

1038
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,730
Congratulations.

1039
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,140
Hold tight.

1040
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,960
Run!

1041
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,400
What's going on?

1042
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,710
Have these four guys

1043
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,570
never seen a funeral procession?

1044
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,110
Quelian?

1045
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,150
Quelian!

1046
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,070
Quelian!

1047
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,600
Make way!

1048
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,950
Why are you all kneeling here?

1049
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,490
Waiting to pay your last respects to me?

1050
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,250
Stand up now!

1051
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,200
Get out there and

1052
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,410
find her!

1053
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,670
Hurry!

1054
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,110
Yes.

1055
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,670
My Lord.

1056
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,070
Please calm down.

1057
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,870
I'm not angry!

1058
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,550
I'm just worried.

1059
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,800
As an official,

1060
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,070
I must have

1061
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,870
offended many people in my life.

1062
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,110
I'm worried that

1063
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,910
they'll take the chance to take revenge on my wife.

1064
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,840
Don't worry, My Lord.

1065
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,030
All the officials in the city

1066
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,530
are trying their best to apprehend the kidnappers.

1067
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,310
I believe

1068
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,480
we'll find Her Ladyship very soon.

1069
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,630
No.

1070
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,340
This is not enough.
