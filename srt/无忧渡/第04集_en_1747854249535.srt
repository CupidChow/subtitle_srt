00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you doing on

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
the've got music

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,100
Today, when Specifically, would I be able to go together with...?

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,500
I asked Gall.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
I'll take a long phone call.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,500
Come on, text us.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Miss Hua, do you want to talk to Miss�� and Head Service?

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,200
No, I don't want to talk to Miss Nu.

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Address?

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
About my shoulder injury too...

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Come on, drink some water.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Do you want some tea?

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
That's good.

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,400
We don't have tea at home.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
So you suspect your father is still alive?

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Yes.

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Did you tell your family?

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I did, but no one believed me.

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I came to you because I had no other way.

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
You believe me, right?

51
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Is there anything wrong with the body?

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
No.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
The government has checked the body.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
But it could be fake.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Maybe my father was kidnapped.

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
He might still be alive, right?

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Maybe.

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Do you have any other clues?

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Yes.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
There are two mirrors.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I found the mirror in my father's room.

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
One is in the fire scene.

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
What's wrong with this mirror?

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
What's so special about it?

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I couldn't see the figure when I first found them.

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
But I can see it now.

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I came to you because I hope you could go back to Nanyang City with me.

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
And help me investigate the missing of my father.

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
No.

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Why?

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
I have something to do.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I can't leave for now.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You'd better leave Guangping City.

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm not leaving.

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
No one believes me.

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,400
No one can help me except you.

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Do you have money?

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
We mainly work to make money.

79
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
I have money.

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Here.

81
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's not enough.

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
There are six, seven, ten taels of silver.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
The waist is most brutal and slippery.

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
And there are demons in it.

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
It's very dangerous.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I risk my life to do this.

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Do you think it's worth my life?

88
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Didn't you...

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
It was Mr. Geng from Guangping City who came to me in person.

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
He came to help me catch the evil thief.

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
The reward is very generous.

92
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
It's different from you.

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Aren't you a demon hunter?

94
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm a demon hunter.

95
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I need to survive.

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Right?

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Sorry.

98
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I can't help you with this.

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
You'd better find another job.

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Wait.

101
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll pay you.

102
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I'll go and collect the money you said.

103
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I told you I had something to do.

104
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I can't be away for the time being.

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
You don't want to help me.

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Chi Xu, see the guests out.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Come on.

108
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Let's go.

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Come on.

110
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Come on.

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Stop looking.

112
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Where's Yiman?

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Why did he run away?

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Why didn't I notice?

115
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
You don't know Yiman ran away?

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Where did you find him?

117
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I've released him.

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Is it hard to find?

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Dr. Jiu is so kind.

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
He just came back home.

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
He's going out again.

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Is he going to catch the evil again?

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Miss, don't worry.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Guangming City is so big.

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
He's definitely not a demon hunter.

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
We can find him slowly.

127
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
We can find a master to save him.

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Come on.

129
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Just a few words and you won't be late.

130
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Where's the culprit?

131
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
He's a demon hunter.

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I suspect he has a case.

133
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I want to ask him.

134
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
He ran away.

135
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Ran away?

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
I heard it's Dr. Jiu.

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
You dragged him away.

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Did you find something so long?

139
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,400
What is your relationship with the evil thief?

140
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Chu Butong, you always think I'm a murderer.

141
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Why are you asking me? Go and investigate it yourself.

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Jiu Xun Yi, don't think that I'll let you go just because you saved my life.

143
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Chu Le. Chu Le, the master is looking for you.

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Chu Le. Chu Le.

145
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Xun Yi, you're angry.

146
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
You're angry.

147
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
We've been waiting too long. We have to find Duan Banxia as soon as possible.

148
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,400
We can't be deceived by the evil thief.

149
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Why would you catch the evil thief and find Duan Banxia?

150
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
And you just kicked him out.

151
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I know. You regret it. You should apologize first.

152
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Who caught Ren Mian Xiao?

153
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
You.

154
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
And?

155
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Me.

156
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
And a little girl.

157
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Oh, right.

158
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Yin Man is Ren Mian Xiao's half-devil.

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Ren Mian Xiao died. He will take revenge for Ren Mian Xiao.

160
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
But he can't beat you.

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
So he went to find Duan Banxia.

162
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
You finally understand.

163
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Then you kick him out.

164
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
If he doesn't leave, will Yin Man show up?

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Yeah.

166
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
There aren't many guest houses in the city. Let's split up and look for him.

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Split up and look for him.

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Slow down, miss.

169
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
This corridor is connected to the front and back yard.

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
The yard is spacious and the scenery is beautiful.

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
There are several guest houses.

172
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
If you have a large population, you can live in many of them.

173
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Let me show you this one.

174
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Slow down.

175
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Come in and have a look.

176
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
How is it?

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
This is a big guest house, right?

178
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
No wonder. You call this business good.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
No one talks behind your back.

180
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Your room is really nice.

181
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
But it's all dust.

182
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
It doesn't look like people live here.

183
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Is there a problem?

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
No, no. How could there be a problem?

185
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Because I said my shop was about to close.

186
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
So I haven't lived here for a long time.

187
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
It's a little dusty.

188
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Boss, do you know the shopkeeper next door?

189
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
No.

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
No, no, no.

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Because we are closed.

192
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
We do business ourselves.

193
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
What's wrong, girl?

194
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Did you hear any rumors?

195
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Don't believe it. It's nonsense.

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Boss, go get a pen and paper.

197
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I'll rent this shop when I have time.

198
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Okay, I'll get it here.

199
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Okay.

200
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll leave you to your own business.

202
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Okay.

203
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Miss,

204
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
we don't have money. Why do you still rent the shop?

205
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Why don't we find a hotel to stay?

206
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
What do you think?

207
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Do you think he doesn't help us

208
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
just because he wants money?

209
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Why?

210
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
If it's really because of money,

211
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
he should just say a specific number.

212
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,400
And he knows my family's situation.

213
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I didn't think he was a greedy person

214
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
when I was with him before.

215
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
You've known him for a few days.

216
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
What can you tell?

217
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Anyway, I think there must be another reason.

218
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Could it be that

219
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
he thinks it's too complicated

220
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
and he can't handle it,

221
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
so he doesn't help us?

222
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
It's possible.

223
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
What should we do now?

224
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Write a letter to Yuanzhou

225
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
and ask them to send money.

226
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Not write a letter to the young master?

227
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
If my brother knows I'm here,

228
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
he'll come and take me back.

229
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Yuanzhou is not far from Nanyang.

230
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
The young master will know sooner or later.

231
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
It's a day's work.

232
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
And then?

233
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
And then we'll find out

234
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
why he doesn't help us.

235
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
What's wrong?

236
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Chi Xu, did you find it?

237
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
No.

238
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I've searched all the traditional hotels

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
but I couldn't find Nanyang.

240
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Did he get eaten by the hidden?

241
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Dr. Jue, Chi Xu.

242
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I brought you some candy.

243
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I'll give you a taste.

244
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Candy?

245
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Why?

246
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I moved.

247
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I just came to Guangping.

248
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I didn't have a place to stay.

249
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I thought the hotel was too noisy.

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
The store next door was on rent.

251
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
The price was right, so I rented it.

252
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
We're neighbors now.

253
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
We need to take care of each other.

254
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
It's late. I'll go back first.

255
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Qian Yi,

256
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
he's lucky.

257
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Miss,

258
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
you can change your water.

259
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I'll go.

260
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Are you done?

261
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
We have to ask more than 40 questions.

262
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
We only have half of them.

263
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
When will we finish?

264
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Soon.

265
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Okay.

266
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
What about the gambling house?

267
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
You said

268
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
if I go there again,

269
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I'll be in trouble.

270
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
What about the men and women

271
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
who pass by the door?

272
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Women.

273
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
You're so sure?

274
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Let's bet.

275
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
What?

276
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
I've got the name.

277
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I bet this month's small silver.

278
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
You said you wouldn't go back.

279
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm a dog.

280
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Why are you laughing?

281
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
What's wrong?

282
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
The Zhang family is in trouble.

283
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
The people of our government

284
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
have blocked the way.

285
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
No one is allowed to pass.

286
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
What's the big deal?

287
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
No, no.

288
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
This road is the only way to buy food.

289
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
He cooks for our government.

290
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
He's one of our people.

291
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
So I just let him go.

292
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
He should come back

293
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
when the time is right.

294
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Maybe not.

295
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Maybe not.

296
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Don't play tricks.

297
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
You...

298
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Mrs. Zhang.

299
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Please leave.

300
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Don't stop.

301
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Hurry.

302
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
You're here.

303
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Who won?

304
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Me.

305
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
You're so ungrateful.

306
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Who told you to come back?

307
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Where's your wife?

308
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I've been busy in the backyard.

309
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
It's really...

310
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Mr. Zhu.

311
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Where's the body?

312
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Mr. Zhu, it's in the room.

313
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Let's go.

314
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Tao'er,

315
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
the servants said

316
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
the deceased is not from the mansion.

317
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
But all the jewelry

318
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
she's wearing is Mrs. Zhang's.

319
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
You'll know when you see her.

320
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Don't let her go.

321
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Go.

322
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Go.

323
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Go.

324
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
My lord.

325
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
What's the matter?

326
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
We arrived

327
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
and Mrs. Zhang wasn't there.

328
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
A few days ago, Mrs. Zhang suddenly changed her appearance.

329
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
She was as if she had been young for a few decades.

330
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,000
The servants were surprised, but they thought she had used some

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,400
well-known prescription, so they didn't say anything.

332
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Last night, the guests were invited to dinner and the guests were drinking.

333
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,600
Mrs. Zhang suddenly felt dizzy and went back to her room to rest.

334
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Since then, she has never left her room.

335
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,000
But what's strange is that we found a body of a 70-80-year-old woman in the bedroom.

336
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The deceased was not from the mansion.

337
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,600
But the clothes were all Mrs. Zhang's.

338
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
This is a bit strange.

339
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,800
Yuhuang.

340
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Yes.

341
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,000
What do you think?

342
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,600
I have a bold guess.

343
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Someone sneaked into the mansion and took Mrs. Zhang away.

344
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
As for that body, I don't have any clues yet.

345
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Wenjian.

346
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
Sir.

347
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
What do you think?

348
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
I...

349
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,600
I completely agree with the first-time officer's opinion.

350
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
Mrs. Zhang is an official. Her status is high and noble.

351
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,800
You must not be careless. You must investigate this thoroughly and get to the case as soon as possible.

352
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Yes.

353
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,000
The rain is so heavy. I want to go out and get used to it.

354
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,000
Miss, the letter has already been sent back.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,200
It will arrive in seven or eight days.

356
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,600
We must wait at least half a month before we receive the letter.

357
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I will wait for you.

358
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
Okay.

359
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
The money has finally arrived.

360
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
How much did you send home?

361
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
200 taels.

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
200 taels?

363
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,600
Is he worth that much money?

364
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,000
You think the most important thing is ability.

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,400
I don't know if he is that powerful.

366
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,400
But when I heard you say it, I thought he was a white-haired master.

367
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
I didn't think he was this young.

368
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
It's raining so hard.

369
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Do you have any wet clothes?

370
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
No.

371
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Hurry and dry yourself.

372
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Come and light the lamp with me.

373
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Sorry, sorry. Did I hurt you?

374
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Miss, are you okay?

375
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I'm fine.

376
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I got your shoes dirty. I'm sorry.

377
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
It's okay.

378
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Thank goodness you helped me. Otherwise, I would have fallen.

379
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Otherwise, I would have fallen.

380
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I can't light the lamp for three days and nights.

381
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
If it goes out, it won't be bright.

382
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
It went out!

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
It's okay. It's okay.

384
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
We haven't finished yet. I'll change it for you.

385
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
If it goes out, it won't be bright.

386
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
What do you mean by that?

387
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Don't you know?

388
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
The Bodhisattva of the Buddha of the Four Devas is very bright.

389
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
As long as you light the lamp in front of Buddha,

390
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
you can achieve anything you want.

391
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Really?

392
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Then I'll go with you.

393
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Miss, are you from outside?

394
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
How did you know?

395
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I guessed.

396
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,400
My name is Xu Zhi Zhi. This is Sister Ji Li.

397
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
We are from the Yunmen Wu Fang.

398
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
If you have time, you can come and watch our performance.

399
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Okay.

400
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
What's your name?

401
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
My surname is Duan.

402
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Duan Fan Xia.

403
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
What a nice name.

404
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
How do you say it?

405
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
It sounds very rich.

406
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Very rich?

407
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
In summer, there are lots of fruits and vegetables.

408
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
There are also pears.

409
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Yes, I bought some pears on my way.

410
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Sister Ji Li doesn't like pears.

411
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
It smells good.

412
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
But I can't eat it either.

413
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I want to become thinner.

414
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I light the lamp to become thinner.

415
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Next time you see me, don't think I'm too thin.

416
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Xun Yi, they haven't come out for so long.

417
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
They won't be eaten by the Yi Man, right?

418
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
No.

419
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Why?

420
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Is the Yi Man a Buddhist?

421
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Will he not kill in the temple?

422
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
There's a snake.

423
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
It's a jade vase.

424
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Where do you live?

425
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Changping, Sifang Street.

426
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I know that side.

427
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
You've done a murder case there, right?

428
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Sister Ji Li, is it there?

429
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I don't know.

430
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
You haven't been there yet.

431
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
What murder case?

432
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
You don't know?

433
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Six years ago, a murder case happened in Changping, Sifang Street.

434
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
A family member's son killed his parents and brother.

435
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,400
He even killed the three men who helped him in his house.

436
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
It was very chaotic.

437
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Why?

438
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
I heard that it was parents' bias.

439
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
They wanted to leave all their property to their eldest son.

440
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,400
The youngest son killed the whole family.

441
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Since then, the feng shui there is not very good.

442
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
No one wants to go.

443
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
The shop can't be opened for a long time.

444
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
You said the rent was cheap.

445
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
That's the reason.

446
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Which family is it?

447
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I heard it's a pharmacy.

448
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Let's go.

449
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Which pharmacy is that?

450
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I don't know.

451
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Don't listen to Zhi Zhi.

452
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
She likes to talk.

453
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
She likes to listen to the street gossip.

454
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
In ten sentences, eight sentences are all lies.

455
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Don't take it to heart.

456
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I don't.

457
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
I've lived here for so many years.

458
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Can I remember such a big thing?

459
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
If you don't have money, move out.

460
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Xue Yi, they said you were bad.

461
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
We won't help them.

462
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Miss, is she talking about the main pharmacy next door?

463
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
That Ganshan Drugstore is a pharmacy.

464
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
I don't think so.

465
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
No.

466
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,400
She's been caught for such a big thing.

467
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
That's right.

468
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Miss, do you know if she has any relatives?

469
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Isn't the one who always follows her brother?

470
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Shi Xue, she's a demon.

471
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Demon?

472
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
What demon?

473
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
A rabbit demon.

474
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Rabbit?

475
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
A rabbit demon?

476
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Don't you know?

477
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You never told me.

478
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
But it doesn't matter.

479
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
You don't have to be afraid.

480
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Isn't it good to eat blood?

481
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Isn't Dr. Jiu a main pharmacist?

482
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Why is he following a demon?

483
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
That's weird.

484
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Maybe demons are also good and bad.

485
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
You have no conscience.

486
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Miss, is that rabbit demon talking about us?

487
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
What case?

488
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
You don't know?

489
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,400
A few days ago, a murder case took place in Changping Lane.

490
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,400
A family member's son killed his parents and brother.

491
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
He also killed three of his family members.

492
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
It was very chaotic.

493
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I don't have a family.

494
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
If you come to Guangping City,

495
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,400
can you come to Changping Lane and Ganshan Drugstore?

496
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I'm sorry.

497
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm sorry.

501
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm sorry.

503
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm sorry.

512
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm sorry.

513
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm sorry.

514
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm sorry.

515
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm sorry.

518
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm sorry.

519
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm sorry.

521
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I'm sorry.

523
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
A foreigner

526
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,200

Come and take a look at me.

530
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,680
Can you see any windows,

531
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,780

532
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,280
Well of course there is.

533
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
Thanks.

534
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,600

Did something happen?

542
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,520
I think I got a cold last night.

543
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
I feel uncomfortable after waking up today.

544
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
Aren't you a doctor?

545
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I'll come and see you.

546
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,520
Come in.

547
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Your soup is all gone.

548
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,320
You made lamb soup?

549
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,920
Don't move. That soup isn't for people.

550
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,520
Come here.

551
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,520
Change your hand.

552
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,520
What is this?

553
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,320
You're not in any serious condition. You can go back and rest.

554
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,720
Do you need to take some medicine?

555
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,520
No.

556
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,320
If you're worried, you can go back and boil some ginger water.

557
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,120
Just sweat it out.

558
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,920
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Jiu.

559
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,720
Thank you, Dr. Jiu.

560
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Is there anything else?

561
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,720
Chi Xue isn't here.

562
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,120
Why are you looking for Chi Xue?

563
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,920
I just moved here.

564
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,920
I don't have much at home. I want to buy some things on the street.

565
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,720
But I'm afraid I can't bring too much home, so I want to ask for a favor.

566
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,520
Chi Xue is a demon.

567
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,120
I know. A rabbit demon. I've seen it before.

568
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,920
You're not afraid?

569
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,520
He's your person. He must be a good demon.

570
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Xuan Yi, did you hear me and Ting Zhou talking yesterday?

571
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
We didn't mean to.

572
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,920
We heard others discussing it and discussed it together.

573
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,120
I know they're not talking about you.

574
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,720
It's me.

575
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,720
The person who killed my parents and my three partners was me.

576
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
You don't believe me?

577
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,320
I don't believe you. If it was really you, you would've been arrested long ago.

578
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,520
It's possible that I spent money to bribe the officials to get away with it.

579
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,120
It's such a big case. I'm not saying you can't pay for it.

580
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,520
Even if it's really you who said it,

581
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,320
I believe you have your own reason.

582
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,920
Just like how my father disappeared, everyone said he was dead.

583
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,120
But I know he didn't.

584
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,320
The world isn't always like what it looks like in front of you.

585
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,920
A lot of things are beyond your control.

586
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,920
And when I first saw you, I thought you were a good person.

587
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,520
You made me want to believe you.

588
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,120
So I believe you won't do anything bad.

589
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:14,120
I wouldn't give my two thumbs up after the blind meeting.

590
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,320
But since you're the one who made me realize the evidence,

591
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,920
I thought that charges were considered.

592
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,520
I believe you'd better take that into account.

593
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,120
Number one, you're such a smart eventually.

594
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
I didn't say how much you want to take.

595
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
And I've been to my grandmother's house.

596
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,320
It's not a small house.

597
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,840
As long as you come back to Nanyang with me,

598
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,800
find my father,

599
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
I can give you as much money as you want.

600
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,400
Really?

601
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,120
Yes.

602
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,960
And you said

603
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,640
my eyes can see the demon.

604
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,480
It's a talent that's unparalleled.

605
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,920
I can help you.

606
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
I'll definitely do it.

607
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,080
You help me?

608
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,920
Have you been to Guangping before?

609
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,720
Yes.

610
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,200
When I was little,

611
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,080
my father worked in the government office of Guangping.

612
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,640
My mother died,

613
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,920
and we moved away.

614
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,280
So you're familiar with Guangping.

615
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,160
Not really.

616
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,120
It's all my childhood.

617
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,200
Then you can take a closer look.

618
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
Come on.

619
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,120
Guangping is the capital of the Three Kingdoms.

620
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,880
Since the beginning of Shang Zhou,

621
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,720
people have lived here.

622
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,120
It's been thousands of years.

623
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
It's really prosperous.

624
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,120
Yes, it is.

625
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Didn't you say

626
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
you have a talent that's unparalleled?

627
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,440
Come on, take a good look.

628
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,600
See which are humans and which are demons on this street.

629
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,000
Help!

630
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Help!

631
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Help!

632
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Help!

633
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Shen Ye!

634
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Shen Ye!

635
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Shen Ye!

636
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
Are you okay?

637
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,720
The order is in place.

638
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,320
Why are you here?

639
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,520
I think people here are here to catch fish.

640
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,320
Catch fish?

641
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,720
Do you know how dangerous this place is?

642
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,120
This river connects to the underground city.

643
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,920
It's very dangerous for people to get mixed up in the underground city.

644
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,320
If you were just dragged into the underground city by the river,

645
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
and were caught by the demons,

646
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,720
you wouldn't be able to come back.

647
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,680
You're lying.

648
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,320
Our teacher said there's no fish in the world.

649
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,720
That's because your teacher has never seen a demon.

650
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,720
A teacher is a master of many skills.

651
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
He won't make a mistake.

652
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
You believe in your teacher, right?

653
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,920
Okay.

654
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,720
Let's go.

655
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,920
I'll take you to see it.

656
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
No, don't!

657
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Are you scared?

658
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Don't come here again.

659
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,720
Do you remember?

660
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
I remember.

661
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Okay, go back.

662
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Thank you, Grandpa.

663
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Why did you follow me?

664
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Did you tell the kids that you were lying or not?

665
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,920
Do you know what the underground city is like?

666
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,520
The underground city is a city separated from the world.

667
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,920
It was discovered more than a hundred years ago.

668
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,320
No one knows who built it.

669
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,120
No one knows when it was built.

670
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,520
That place is called the underground city.

671
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,320
No one knows when it was built.

672
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,720
That place is hard to find.

673
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
So many stores and shops,

674
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,120
including the business that can't be bought,

675
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,720
are all in that place.

676
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
You just heard it.

677
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,920
The underground city is very dangerous.

678
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
You keep talking about your father.

679
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
That's just your side of the story.

680
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Is there a demon in the city?

681
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,720
Or you can't accept the fact that your family left?

682
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,320
I don't know yet.

683
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,120
My father must have been hurt in the mortal world.

684
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,520
If your father were in the underground city, would you go?

685
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,120
Why wouldn't I dare to go?

686
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,720
No matter what the danger is, I must save my father.

687
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,120
It's best if you're willing to help me.

688
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,120
If you're not willing to help, I can't force you.

689
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,720
How about this? You can ask for a price.

690
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
You sound like you're very rich.

691
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,920
I am very rich.

692
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,320
Do you have a thousand taels?

693
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,720
Yes.

694
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,120
You really have one?

695
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,720
Yes.

696
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,720
Okay, give it to me.

697
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,120
How can I? You don't even sign a contract.

698
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,720
I never sign contracts.

699
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,120
I just take it and leave if I don't have one.

700
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,520
Don't be so anxious.

701
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,320
Besides, who would take a thousand taels with them?

702
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,320
We've been walking for half a day and we haven't eaten breakfast.

703
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,520
Let's go eat something first.

704
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,320
Let go of me.

705
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,720
No, just go.

706
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,120
That Yanyan Restaurant said the food is delicious.

707
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,720
There's also a dance performance.

708
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,520
Let go of my hand.

709
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,120
This way, this way.

710
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,520
What would you like to order?

711
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
We haven't been here either.

712
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,520
What would you like to recommend?

713
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,120
We have three great dishes.

714
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,520
Roasted Tofu, lamb, and salmon.

715
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,720
What would you like to eat?

716
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,520
Then I'll have both.

717
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,720
And a pancake.

718
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,520
Okay.

719
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,920
You're really rich.

720
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,520
Isn't it because I'm a rich person?

721
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm usually very simple.

722
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,420
I'm not worried about money.

723
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,920
Didn't they say there's a dance performance here?

724
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Do you want to see it?

725
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,320
If you want to see it, I'll tell them to change to a new one.

726
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,120
No need.

727
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,920
It's quite nice here.

728
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,920
Be more quick!

729
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,520
Is everything ready inside?

730
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,120
Tianrui said I should come in first.

731
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,480
He will be here soon.

732
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Mrs. Qi,

733
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:44,160
what's that

734
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,760
mulheres' spirit a ill把순

735
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Yes.

736
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,320
What are you rushing?

737
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,480
Master, I'm ready.

738
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,560
We can start now.

739
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,480
You're finally ready.

740
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,160
Come on, everyone.

741
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,840
Move.

742
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Come on.

743
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,640
Don't just stand there.

744
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,240
Hurry up.

745
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,760
We're about to start.

746
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
Come on, Master.

747
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Hurry up.

748
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Hurry up.

749
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Come on.

750
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Come on.

751
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Come on.

752
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Hurry up.

753
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Come on.

754
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Hurry up.

755
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Come on.

756
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Come on.

757
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Come on.

758
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Come on.

759
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Good.

760
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Good.

761
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Good.

762
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Good.

763
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Good.

764
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
That's not right.

765
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,760
The moon crosses the snowy land and forgets all.

766
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:32,760
When the peach blossoms fall, I look back and think of you.

767
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:40,760
If I had no face, I wouldn't have left a star to light up the world.

768
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:48,760
The stars in the sky are so beautiful.

769
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,760
The moon is so beautiful.

770
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I can only forget about you.

771
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:20,760
The moon crosses the snowy land and forgets all.

772
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:30,760
When the peach blossoms fall, I look back and think of you.

773
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,760
If I had no face, I wouldn't have left a star to light up the world.

774
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,760
The stars in the sky are so beautiful.

775
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,760
The moon is so beautiful.

776
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,760
I can only forget about you.

777
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,760
The moon crosses the snowy land and forgets all.

778
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:11,760
When the peach blossoms fall, I look back and think of you.

779
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:21,760
If I had no face, I wouldn't have left a star to light up the world.

780
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:36,760
The end is near.
