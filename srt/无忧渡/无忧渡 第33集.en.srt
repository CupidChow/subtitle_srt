3
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,479
Sir, here's your pastry.

4
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,080
Thank you.

5
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,229
As a constable,

6
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,910
you're completely weak.

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,940
Well, I'm a female constable.

8
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,790
Pastry.

9
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,760
Sir, would you like to look at some fabric?

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,950
They're all high-quality fabrics.

12
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,120
Dear customers,

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
welcome to our store.

14
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,360
Sir,

15
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,090
you've bought quite a lot.

16
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,840
Are you setting up a new home?

17
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,190
Newly-weds, huh?

18
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,200
You have a good eye, sir.

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,860
You're quite perceptive.

20
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,680
Congratulations, congratulations!

21
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Since you two are newlyweds,

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,980
you must use high-quality bedding.

23
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,050
Come, this way please.

24
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,380
Let me introduce to you.

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,840
Over here, we have

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,970
the finest bedding.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,660
Take a look.

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
For this fabric,

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,470
comfort is the most important thing.

30
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,070
Do you have anything better?

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,680
This way.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,120
These are all excellent fabrics.

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,180
Please take a look.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,210
Madam, you have such good taste.

35
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,870
After choosing the fabric...

36
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,360
Take care, both of you.

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,620
Welcome back anytime.

38
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,210
I'll take it.

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,890
Alright.

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,770
Let's go.

41
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,480
May you have a child soon!

42
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,560
Thank you for your hard work.

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
It's nothing worth mentioning.

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,269
I also bought some

45
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,310
medicinal food and supplements.

46
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,640
There are some for you and some for Banxia.

47
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
You're a doctor yourself;

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,060
you should be able to tell them apart.

49
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,830
Okay.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,530
Alright.

51
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,630
Then we'll head back first.

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,560
You two

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,360
may recover without worry here.

54
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,040
I left so suddenly last time,

55
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,750
I don't know how much trouble it caused.

56
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,150
I'm worried Wen Jian can't handle it alone.

57
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,390
I'm sorry for being a burden to you all.

58
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,480
Don't say that.

59
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,010
We're all friends here;

60
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,240
there's no need to be so polite.

61
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,430
Banxia is a good girl.

62
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,490
Don't let her suffer any grievances.

63
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,750
I understand.

64
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,090
Form ranks.

65
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,130
Your ears...

66
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
How did they heal?

67
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,680
I was confined by the Peerless Bracelet for many years.

68
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,190
Suddenly losing that restriction,

69
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,450
my demon power surged.

70
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Plus, someone was causing trouble in the shadows.

71
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,830
So I couldn't control myself for a while.

72
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,600
But fortunately, during this time,

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
I've figured out

74
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,430
how to circulate my demon power.

75
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,830
I used what my father once taught me,

76
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,390
the secret technique of the Eight Pillar Sect.

77
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,050
Gradually,

78
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,090
I can control it at will now.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,730
That's good.

80
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,720
This way,

81
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
others won't be able to tell you're a demon.

82
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,580
That's much more convenient.

83
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,560
Indeed.

84
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,040
Let's eat.

85
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,930
Is it yummy?

86
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,650
It's delicious.

87
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
You're lying.

88
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,970
They don't know how to cook.

89
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,750
How would they know what ingredients to buy?

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,680
Next time, I'll have to

91
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,000
go to town myself

92
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,000
to buy some tasty ingredients.

93
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,420
Let me show you my cooking skills.

94
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,710
Then I'll go with you.

95
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,720
Alright.

96
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,430
Xuanye,

97
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,750
that person causing trouble in the shadows you mentioned,

98
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,390
is it your elder brother?

99
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,800
Yes.

100
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,120
Is it the same person

101
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,050
we saw at Chi Xue's grave last time?

102
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,780
Are you scared?

103
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,270
It's not that I'm scared.

104
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,190
It's just that he keeps

105
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,790
coming back again and again.

106
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,240
It seems like he's not just

107
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,040
trying to cause trouble for you.

108
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,320
Is he asking you to go back home?

109
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,530
Are you going to go back?

110
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,920
If I go back,

111
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,220
what about you?

112
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,870
Besides,

113
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,470
I can't bear to leave you.

114
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,659
Alright, don't think too much about it.

115
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,330
Let's eat.

116
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,740
Okay.

117
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,630
Xuanye,

118
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,000
have you thought about how to explain to my parents

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,460
when we return to Nanyang?

120
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,790
I'll just tell them the truth.

121
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,800
How can you tell them the truth?

122
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,380
You definitely can't let them know

123
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,670
about your true identity.

124
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,270
Especially,

125
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,930
you can't let my brother know.

126
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,730
Think about it.

127
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
My brother's marriage with Manniang

128
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,080
was ruined by me.

129
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,460
If he finds out

130
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,670
that you're also a demon,

131
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,130
it'll cause a huge uproar.

132
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,570
I can already imagine what he'll say.

133
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,980
You're a demon, Manniang is also a demon.

134
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,550
So why can't he be with Manniang

135
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,610
if I can be with you?

136
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
But it's definitely different.

137
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,050
Although you're both demons,

138
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,240
Manniang is an evil demon.

139
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,610
She killed people.

140
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,000
No matter what,

141
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,210
you can't marry

142
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,630
a murderer, can you?

143
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,600
But you're different.

144
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,670
You uphold justice and are always willing to help others.

145
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,320
Taking someone like you as a husband

146
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
would be a tremendous blessing.

147
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,220
Taking me as a husband?

148
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,860
Marrying off to you.

149
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,810
Marrying off to you works too.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,730
What are you smiling about?

151
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,980
This year,

152
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,250
you're turning nineteen, right?

153
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Why are you bringing that up?

154
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,650
I'm just calculating,

155
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
if we have a daughter,

156
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,350
how long would it take

157
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,170
for her to grow up to be like you?

158
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
Don't always

159
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,750
treat me like a child.

160
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,630
Besides,

161
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,030
you're not even married yet.

162
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,030
Where will this daughter come from?

163
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,200
Even if we do get married one day

164
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,920
and have a daughter,

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
she might not look like me at all.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,220
She might take after you instead.

167
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,710
She would be a little panther.

168
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,180
My daughter is a little panther.

169
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,460
Xuanye,

170
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,870
would our child

171
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
know demonic spells?

172
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,550
I suppose they would.

173
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,470
Then how would I ever manage her?

174
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,550
What clan do you belong to?

175
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,190
The Mystic Panther Clan.

176
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,530
The Mystic Panther Clan, so that means...

177
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,670
She'll grow a tail,

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,510
sharp teeth,

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,840
have fur,

180
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,510
and be fierce and strong.

181
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,670
Banxia,

182
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,830
would you feel wronged?

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,720
About what?

184
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,670
Being with me,

185
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,980
not knowing if it's a blessing

186
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,170
or a curse.

187
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,960
Overthinking is pointless in most situations.

188
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,400
If we can't change it,

189
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,170
we should choose to accept it.

190
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,540
If we always make things difficult for ourselves,

191
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
we'll never get over such hurdles.

192
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,320
Xuanye,

193
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,960
no matter what happens,

194
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,980
it's our fate.

195
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,080
We just need to cherish it

196
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,140
and that's enough.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,610
Alright,

198
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,300
I'll listen to you.

199
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Moreover,

200
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,120
who knows

201
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,200
when will

202
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
such a good thing happen?

203
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,390
Let's eat.

204
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
Did you catch that panther demon?

205
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,390
I was incompetent, Master.

206
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,250
I let it escape.

207
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,900
Never mind.

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,520
This was an unexpected bonus to begin with.

209
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,770
Catch it if you can,

210
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,480
but don't be obsessed if you can't.

211
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,920
Chunmian,

212
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,130
you must remember when you do things,

213
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,300
never waver in your decisions

214
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,930
and have too much greed.

215
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,250
We only need to identify one goal,

216
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
hold onto it

217
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
tightly, and that's enough.

218
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,170
You're right, Master.

219
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,030
Master,

220
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,320
this is what the panther demon dropped.

221
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,080
The Bone Flute of the Mystic Panther Clan.

222
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,730
This is exactly it.

223
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,320
Chunmian.

224
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,750
You've done a great service.

225
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,130
This Bone Flute

226
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,630
has the power to reveal and confuse the demon clan.

227
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,340
With it,

228
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,880
our plan

229
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,310
will be even more secure.

230
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,590
[Jingguan]

231
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,030
Does it look good?

232
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,660
It looks good.

233
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,600
it's just a bit too big.

234
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,050
Then let's go to town tomorrow to buy another one.

235
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,010
It's getting late.

236
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,920
We should get some rest soon.

237
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,720
You go ahead and rest then.

238
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,850
I'll sleep outside.

239
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,350
Don't do that.

240
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,120
There's not even a spot

241
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,520
to shelter from the wind and rain out there.

242
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,900
I'll fetch some water for you.

243
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,140
♫When you're in love, your smile is like the spring breeze♫

244
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,930
♫Walking beside me, bathed in moonlight♫

245
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,140
♫No need for words, I already feel it♫

246
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,700
♫Dark hair like ink, time stretches on♫

247
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,610
♫When you're in love, you wish this love could last forever♫

248
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,950
♫Leaning in close to whisper softly♫

249
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,540
♫I miss you♫

250
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,650
♫On every moonlit night♫

251
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,030
♫Tenderness ties us together♫

♫Let me take your hand and keep our promise♫

253
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,530
♫You shake my soul and pull at my heartstrings♫

254
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,980
♫If I think this world is beautiful♫

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,730
♫It's partly because of the moon♫

256
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,340
♫And mostly because I met you♫

257

258

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,250
♫This lingering love♫

260
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,270
♫Is a treasure we both cherish♫

261

♫When I turn around, you're there♫

262
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,730
♫Right by my side♫

263
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,170
♫When life gets hard♫

♫All I wish for is to stay by your side♫

265
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,250
♫This lingering love♫

266
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,180
♫Is a treasure we both cherish♫

267
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,890
♫When I turn around, you're there♫

268
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,500
♫Right by my side♫

269
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,790
Here.

270
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,870
Where's Sima Lingying?

271
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,290
She didn't come.

272
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,080
It would be too conspicuous if both of us came.

273
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
How is Xuanye?

274
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,690
Has he found a place to settle?

275
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,000
Xuanye found a courtyard outside the city.

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,530
He's staying there for now.

277
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,770
That's good.

278
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,600
He should focus on recovering first.

279
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,859
He can come back when things settle down.

280
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,349
Why all the sighing?

281
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,630
Isn't Xuanye fine now?

282
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,609
No, you don't understand.

283
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,520
He's been training in martial arts and cultivating with his father since childhood.

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,950
After his family's tragic death,

285
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,069
he took up his father's mantle

286
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,480
and became a demon hunter.

287
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,510
Although he's not exactly

288
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,020
obsessed with hating demons,

289
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,640
over the years,

290
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,720
the number of demons he's defeated

291
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,640
is countless.

292
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
But now...

293
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,420
Who would have thought he himself is a demon?

294
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,850
I'm just worried

295
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,360
he won't be able to come to terms with it.

296
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,430
Our worrying won't help.

297
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,810
This is his own matter.

298
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,310
He has to figure it out on his own.

299
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,910
You're right.

300
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,920
How's the situation with Lord Geng?

301
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,520
Has he investigated Banxia's disappearance?

302
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,140
If he was going to, he would have done so already.

303
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,910
Our Lord

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,930
sees things as clearly as a mirror.

305
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,820
He knows exactly what's going on,

306
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,550
he just doesn't say it out loud.

307
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,930
Lord Geng is a good official,

308
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,730
but this incident

309
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
has put him in a difficult position.

310
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,830
You're awake.

311
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,050
Why am I sleeping here?

312
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,310
You're one to talk.

313
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,160
Your wounds haven't fully healed yet.

314
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,110
It's so cold at night.

315
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,710
Why did you go sleep outside?

316
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,920
Luckily, I woke up in the middle of the night

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,010
and carried you inside.

318
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,070
Otherwise, what if you caught a cold?

319
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,220
You carried me in?

320
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,310
You're so heavy.

321
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,970
How could I possibly lift you?

322
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,510
Of course I had to

323
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,550
drag you in.

324
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,350
Your wounds definitely haven't healed completely.

325
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,680
Otherwise, when I was dragging you,

326
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,280
why didn't you wake up at all?

327
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,040
Tonight,

328
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,720
you're not allowed to sleep outside again.

329
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,250
Otherwise, I'll get angry.

330
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,230
Okay.

331
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,000
Go wash up quickly

332
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,160
and change your clothes.

333
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,420
I'll go make some food.

334
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,200
Go sit down quickly.

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,730
The food will be ready soon.

336
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,880
Last night...

337
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,550
Nothing.

338
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
Nothing happened at all.

339
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,960
It probably got chilly last night.

340
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
You felt a bit cold,

341
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,200
so you transformed back into your beast form.

342
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
Once inside, you found a warm spot,

343
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,570
and fell asleep.

344
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,340
My hand wasn't hurt by you either.

345
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,310
I woke up in the middle of the night,

346
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,040
and was startled when I saw you.

347
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,810
So I accidentally sprained it myself.

348
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,670
It has nothing to do with you.

349
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,240
Go sit down quickly.

350
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,730
The food will be ready soon.

351
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,200
Xuanye,

352
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,160
you mentioned last time

353
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,790
your demon transformation was because of the Peerless Bracelet

354
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,790
and your brother.

355
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,440
So this time, could it be...

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,130
It's not him.

357
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,210
Before, he just wanted me to

358
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,770
be clear about my identity.

359
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,390
Now that he's achieved his goal,

360
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,370
there's no reason

361
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,100
for him to use that thing again.

362
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,350
You trust him a lot.

363
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,040
Zi Kong is my

364
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,920
half-brother of a different mother.

365
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,520
My mother passed away early.

366
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,760
When I was young,

367
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,070
he was always there to accompany me.

368
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,210
Although he acts recklessly,

369
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,210
he wouldn't really harm me.

370
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,390
Have you finished eating?

371
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,720
I'll go clean up.

372
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,410
Let me do it.

373
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,040
What are you thinking about?

374
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,130
Don't always be so heavy-hearted.

375
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,070
Thinking too much will make you age.

376
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,730
You'll grow white hair again.

377
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,280
What's this?

378
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,270
It's a little Xuanye I embroidered myself.

379
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,070
Isn't it cute?

380
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,110
It's cute.

381
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,000
It's for you.

382
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,330
Xuanye,

383
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,460
what's the Carefree Land like?

384
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,680
Haven't you been there?

385
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,550
I was still young at that time.

386
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,050
Plus, I was so scared then,

387
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,310
busy trying to escape.

388
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,410
I didn't have time to see anything.

389
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,400
Carefree Land

390
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,480
is just a really vast world.

391
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,050
Probably similar to here.

392
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,490
What about your father?

393
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,670
My father?

394
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,340
What kind of person is your father?

395
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,310
My father

396
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,440
is a very powerful person.

397
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,130
He's the leader of the Mystic Panther Clan,

398
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,960
the Guardian King of the Carefree Land.

399
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,290
He's usually very busy.

400
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,790
Except during the grand clan meetings,

401
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,050
I rarely get to see him.

402
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,680
Actually, the Mystic Panther Clan

403
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,400
has always been

404
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,720
the guardians of the Carefree Land since ancient times,

405
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,880
responsible for guarding

406
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,940
the Realm Gate and the Carefree Herb.

407
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,930
If your father is the clan leader,

408
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,440
what about you?

409
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,280
Do you want to be the clan leader?

410
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,680
The clan leader.

411
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,310
It seems impressive just by the way it sounds.

412
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,550
Don't all men want to be officials?

413
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,030
Do you want to?

414
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,330
What exactly are you trying to ask?

415
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't know either.

416
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm just...

417
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,160
a bit scared.

418
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,790
I'm afraid that as your abilities grow stronger

419
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,110
and you remember more things,

420
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
you might

421
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
want to go back home one day.

422
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,160
I'm scared

423
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,600
that you'll suddenly leave

424
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,310
and leave me all alone.

425
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,400
Don't be afraid.

426
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,870
No matter what happens,

427
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,950
I will always be with you.

428
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,780
Xuanye,

429
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,760
calm down.

430
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,930
It's me, Banxia.

431
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,460
Xuanye,

432
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,310
it's me, Banxia. Wake up.

433
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,070
Banxia.

434
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,570
Banxia.

435
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,590
Banxia!

436
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,200
I'm fine.

437
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,920
Banxia.

438
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,680
Banxia!

439
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,430
The pass token for the Underground City.

440
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Chief Constable Wen,

441
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,640
we're off duty early today.

442
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,770
Let's go see Xuanye.

443
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,590
Tomorrow is our day off.

444
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,650
Let's go tomorrow.

445
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,420
Chief.

446
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,120
Brother.

447
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,070
I heard that Yanlai Restaurant

448
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,830
has a new dancer

449
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,440
who dances extremely well.

450
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,200
Why don't we go for a drink?

451
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,550
Sure.

452
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,270
You guys go ahead. I'll head back first.

453
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,930
In such a hurry to get home?

454
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,720
Is it because Sima Lingying

455
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,450
is still staying at your place?

456
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,380
Mind your own business.

457
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,090
Get ready for a wedding celebration.

458
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,300
What happened?

459
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,640
How did she get so badly injured?

460
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,240
I need to trouble you

461
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,410
to take care of Banxia for a while.

462
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,200
Where are you going?

463
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,550
I have something to take care of.

464
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,680
If she wakes up,

465
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,270
tell her

466
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,700
to wait for me here.

467
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,040
Can you tell us what it is?

468
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,030
Banxia is seriously injured right now.

469
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,890
Are you sure you want to leave now?

470
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm counting on you two.

471
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,210
Xuanye!

472
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,140
[Ganshan Clinic]

473
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,420
Master.

474
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:18,750
Xuanye,

475
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,660
why are you back?

476
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,400
Uncle,

477
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,270
I've made a decision.

478
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:38,970
Alright.

479
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,770
Banxia.

480
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,890
Lingying went out to buy some things.

481
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,290
She asked me to remind you

482
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,240
to take your medicine on time.

483
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,840
Thank you.

484
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,310
Did Xuanye say anything else?

485
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,240
Xuanye asked you to rest well and recover.

486
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,170
He'll come back to you once he finishes his business.

487
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,639
Don't overthink it.

488
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,949
Xuanye isn't a reckless person.

489
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,630
He must have

490
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,159
his reasons for doing this.

491
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,040
Yes,

492
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,480
he always has his own reasons.

493
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,480
Chief Constable Chu,

494
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,110
could you help me hire a carriage?

495
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,370
I want to return to Nanyang.

496
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,630
Why do you suddenly want to go back to Nanyang?

497
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,090
I've been away for so long.

498
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,510
My family must be worried.

499
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,590
I know

500
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,920
you're angry at Xuanye.

501
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,030
Maybe he'll be back soon.

502
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,650
Why don't you wait for him?

503
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm not angry.

504
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,960
I like him so much.

505
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,590
I know what kind of person

506
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,710
he is.

507
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,000
No matter where, I'll still be waiting for him.

508
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,530
I might as well wait at home.

509
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,920
Besides,

510
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,670
it's inconvenient for you

511
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,470
to have me staying at your place.

512
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,480
How is it inconvenient?

513
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,710
Lingying is here;

514
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,040
she can take care of you.

515
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,110
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

516
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,820
[Ganshan Clinic]

517
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,510
Watch where you're going!

518
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,310
Are you blind?

519
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,420
What a coincidence.

520
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,340
We meet again.

521
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,080
What happened to you?

522
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Did you hit a snag?

523
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,880
I have no intention of being your enemy.

524
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,940
Stop following me.

525
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,560
Who's following you?

526
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,600
I have something to ask you.

527
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,230
Did you know that Xuanye left again?

528
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,920
I heard you two are brothers.

529
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,510
You bully your brother so much,

530
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,710
do your parents know?

531
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
When did he leave?

532
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,050
I'm not telling you.

533
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,070
Where did he go?

534
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,210
That's what I wanted to ask you.

535
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,360
At first, we thought

536
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,920
you came back to provoke him again.

537
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,520
But seeing you in this state,

538
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,710
it seems you're not capable of that.

539
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,590
I'm very curious.

540
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,230
Who did this to you?

541
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,760
Tell me,

542
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,420
so I can thank them.

543
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,170
What are you looking at?

544
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,440
Even if you want to leave,

545
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,190
there's no need to be in such a hurry.

546
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,990
Sima Lingying went to buy stuff.

547
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,180
Why don't you wait until she returns?

548
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,280
I think it's still early.

549
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,100
Could you wait for her?

550
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,150
Chief Constable Chu,

551
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,360
it's not early anymore.

552
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,320
If we wait a bit longer,

553
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,840
we might as well leave tomorrow.

554
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,970
Tomorrow works too.

555
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,710
How about you leave tomorrow?

556
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,910
Chief Constable Chu.

557
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,310
Youhuang.

558
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,870
Who is this?

559
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,800
This is Physician Jiu's brother,

560
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,200
the other panther demon.

561
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,190
Xuanye.

562
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,230
Xuanye.

563
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,220
To suppress your demonic nature,

564
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,880
you even went as far as

565
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,320
forcibly reversing your qi and blood.

566
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,110
This method is extremely dangerous.

567
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,970
Let me tell you,

568
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,870
this is the only time.

569
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,160
You're not allowed to use it again.

570
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,070
I previously

571
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,190
had mastered the method

572
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,590
to control my demon form.

573
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,590
Why can't I

574
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,110
control it anymore?

575
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
I don't know either.

576
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,880
Uncle,

577
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,300
you've lived in the Underground City

578
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,450
for so many years,

579
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,510
often interacting and

580
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,710
and doing business with demons.

581
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,360
Haven't you heard

582
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,590
anything about this?

583
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,950
You should drink some tea first.

584
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,480
I only know

585
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,210
my brother has a secret treasure,

586
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,990
called the Bone Flute.

587
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,080
It can temporarily

588
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,170
make me lose my mind

589
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,880
and lose control of my demon form.

590
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,610
Previously,

591
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,510
he used this method

592
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,740
to force me to reveal my true form.

593
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,440
Xuanye,

594
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,170
if that's the case,

595
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,280
he must be involved in this matter.

596
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,970
How about this?

597
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,480
I'll assign more people

598
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,070
to find him for you.

599
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,760
Thank you for your help, Uncle.

600
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,540
Where's Miss Duan?

601
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,930
She's injured.

602
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,180
Injured by you?

603
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,800
Uncle,

604
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,970
you mentioned a method

605
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,280
to transform from a demon into a human;

606
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,870
does it really exist?

607
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,680
There's no turning back once you've started.

608
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,820
Have you made up your mind?

609
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
Why are you here?

610
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,980
Who hurt you?

611
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,840
What does it have to do with you?

612
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,010
Of course it does.

613
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,800
You are Xuanye's brother.

614
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,860
Although you're not friendly to him,

615
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,070
you're still of the same kind.

616
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,290
Your demon powers are strong.

617
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,410
Whoever can hurt you

618
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,110
must be able to hurt him too.

619
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,640
Of course I need to find out.

620
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
I don't know them.

621
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,520
There were many of them.

622
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
They're all skilled demon hunters.

623
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,300
Their leader

624
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,280
is quite old

625
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,940
and seems to be in poor health.

626
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,050
Where are they?

627
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,210
The Underground City.

628
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,130
Why did they

629
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,930
do this to you?

630
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,000
Man Ying

631
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,280
must have told you

632
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
about my background.

633
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,880
The 12th year is coming.

634
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,740
When the Realm Gate opens,

635
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
it will be our chance to return home.

636
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,040
My purpose coming to the human world this time

637
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,440
is to bring him back home.

638
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,410
In 12 years,

639
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,030
the gate only opens once.

640
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,690
How did you come here then?

641
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,710
I have my own way.

642
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,670
But this method has limitations,

643
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,670
only one person can pass through at a time.

644
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,510
When I came out of the Realm Gate,

645
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,910
I noticed something unusual about the pool water at the gate.

646
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,810
After that,

647
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,680
I saw that group of people

648
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,450
bringing in a flower demon,

649
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,570
telling her,

650
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,400
"If you jump into this Bone Washing Pool,

651
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,190
you can wash away your demonic roots

652
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,790
and transform into a human."

653
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,510
What happened to that flower demon?

654
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,520
It's dead.

655
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,510
Then they discovered me.

656
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,230
So I fought with them.

657
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,160
There were too many of them,

658
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,230
and I was also worried about Man Ying,

659
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,030
so I left.

660
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,530
So, this is the reason why

661
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,220
they're hunting you down.

662
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,880
Perhaps.

663
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,100
After that,

664
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,930
they kept tracking me.

665
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,690
I let my guard down for a moment

666
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,850
and fell into their ambush.

667
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,320
Oh no.

668
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,280
What's wrong?

669
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,410
I suddenly remembered

670
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,530
Xuanye's Uncle had previously asked him

671
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,570
if he wanted to be a demon

672
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,550
or a human.

673
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,730
He could choose.

674
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,630
The leader

675
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,320
is Man Ying's Uncle?

676
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,830
Then, could it be...

677
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,320
Are you sure that the Bone Washing Pool

678
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,030
can't turn demons into humans?

679
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,630
Of course.

680
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,430
I saw it with my own eyes.

681
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,970
It seems that old man

682
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,330
wants to trick Man Ying into it too.

683
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,650
No way.

684
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,480
I need to go to the Underground City.

685
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,230
I'll go with you.

686
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,190
Let's go together.

687
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,850
I'll go too.

688
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,800
Wen Jian, you'd better not go.

689
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,930
It's too dangerous.

690
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,320
Besides, the government office needs someone.

691
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,120
You stay here.

692
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,420
If anything happens to us,

693
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,640
you report to My Lord

694
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,630
to have someone come down to rescue us.

695
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,560
We should hurry.

696
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,190
Then let's set off immediately.

697
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:18,480
Alright.

698
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:18,880
Okay.

699
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,750
As if lambs to the slaughter.

700
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,640
I'll go with you.

701
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,110
Look at you, acting all capable.

702
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,840
If we are lambs to the slaughter,

703
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,900
who were the ones who tied you up here?

704
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,840
Let's go.
