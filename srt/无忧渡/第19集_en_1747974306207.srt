00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
First we have Grim Äryn

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm going to make a

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,800

little bit of a

little bit of a

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
little bit of a

cloud

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
Mr. Cake

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm 전�이랑

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Are you here to buy flowers?

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Bro, does it hurt?

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Bro?

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm telling you, bro.

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
When you talk to people,

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
you should be careful.

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Don't listen to your big brother.

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
What are you doing?

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Help me up.

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Okay.

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
What's going on?

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Why are you here?

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Bro, are you okay?

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Bro, are you stupid?

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
This is our house.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Where can we go if we're not here?

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Four brothers?

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
What?

64
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Sun,

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
is your brain broken?

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Even if my brain is broken,

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
it has nothing to do with being handsome.

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Bro, we have to go to work.

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
It's almost time.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
We have a lot of work today.

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Let's go, bro.

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Where are you going?

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Bro, are you going to buy buns on the street?

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Come and eat.

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Hot buns.

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Eat one bowl and wait for two bowls.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Come on.

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Come on.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Come on.

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Come on.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Come on.

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Come on.

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Come on.

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Come on.

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Come on.

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Guangping.

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Damao.

88
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Damao.

89
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Damao, you're really here.

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Look, I just bought the meat buns.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I haven't had time to get them out.

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Damao, do you want to eat buns today?

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Damao,

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
we have fried bread,

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
vegetables and meat,

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
and a bowl of hot pear jam.

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I guarantee you a meal and a day.

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Come on.

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Come on.

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Come on.

101
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Come on.

102
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
It's crazy.

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Good.

104
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Come on.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
This is a bowl of hot pear jam.

106
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Stop it.

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
It's crazy.

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
How did it turn into food?

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I don't want to live with you.

110
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Who likes it?

111
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
You don't even look at it.

112
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Look, look.

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
They're fighting again.

114
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I want to live with you for a thousand years.

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
You're so annoying.

116
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Go to the street and get the money.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Go away.

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Get out of here.

119
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Go away.

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
The destroyed objects have become ink.

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Everything here is the root of ink.

122
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Am I in the monster's painting?

123
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Brother.

124
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Brother.

125
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Brother.

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Brother, it's almost time.

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
We have to go to the royal family to get the sedan chair.

128
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
After this job,

129
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
you can get a wife if you save enough money.

130
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
It's a good thing.

131
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
We saved enough money and married a wife for brother.

132
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Then there's brother.

133
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Then there's brother.

134
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Brother, you have to support me.

135
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Don't be lazy.

136
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Where are you going as my brother?

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Brother, that's not what I said.

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
We have already collected the deposit.

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Brother,

140
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
you're so naughty.

141
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Where are you going to find someone?

142
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Besides, marriage is a big thing.

143
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
If we mess up with someone,

144
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
we'll be in trouble.

145
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
We can't get our four brothers' strength back.

146
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
If we mess up, we'll be in trouble.

147
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Brother, you're right.

148
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Let go.

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I won't.

150
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I won't.

151
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Why can't I use my strength?

152
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Brother, stop it.

153
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Brother, stop it.

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Brother, you're too naughty.

155
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
What should we do, brother?

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Let's go.

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Stop it, brother.

158
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
We should do what we should do today.

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Let me down.

160
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Brother, brother.

161
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
We're going to marry Mr. Huang.

162
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Of course.

163
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Brother is the first in our city.

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
If you run away now,

165
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
we'll be in trouble.

166
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Brother,

167
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
please be good.

168
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Don't be impulsive.

169
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
It's okay, but it's not necessary.

170
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Brother, come on.

171
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Master.

172
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
It's almost time.

173
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Come on, get up.

174
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
We're coming out soon.

175
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Prepare the horse.

176
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Yes.

177
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Thank you.

178
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Congratulations.

179
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Congratulations, master.

180
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Congratulations, master.

181
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Congratulations.

182
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
It's okay.

183
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Today is my wedding day.

184
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm happy.

185
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm happy.

186
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Huang.

187
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Brother, why are you here again?

188
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Wait for me here.

189
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Wait for me here.

190
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Today we have a banquet.

191
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Please come.

192
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Huang.

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Why are you here?

194
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Did you see Banxia?

195
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Banxia?

196
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
How long have you been here?

197
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Did you find anything?

198
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

199
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't know you either.

200
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
You don't know me?

201
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
How dare you!

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
I know you now.

203
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
You're a nun.

204
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Go and pray for me now.

205
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
If you delay my wedding,

206
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
I'll teach you a lesson.

207
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Come on, brother.

208
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Congratulations.

209
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Come on.

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Come on.

211
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Don't be late.

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Be careful.

213
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Come on.

214
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
What a great wedding.

215
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's go.

216
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Congratulations.

217
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Congratulations.

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Congratulations.

220
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Congratulations.

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,840
This new father is shy and can't go out

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Everyone, blow it

223
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:54,200
New father, new father, new father

224
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Rumor has it that the red powder is mixed

225
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Don't sit in front of the stage

226
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
No need to wear makeup

227
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Keep the double eyebrows for the painter

228
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Good good

229
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Good time to go to bed to celebrate the wedding

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
The couple is happy every year

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
The beautiful marriage is perfect

232
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
The couple sings and the couple follows the wheel of heaven

233
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
It feels good

234
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Good good

235
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Good good

236
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Be careful

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
This is called a bride

238
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
What is this

239
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Big brother, big brother

240
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
This is so ridiculous

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Yes, there is no rule

242
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Miss, slow down, be careful

243
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Sit well

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Big brother, big brother

245
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Give me the確認

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Jing'er, don't worry

247
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I'll go first

248
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Good, take care on the way

249
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Good good

Good good

254
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Now the painting is in the painting

255
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
And the three brothers are in the painting

256
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Good good

257
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Then next year

258
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200

This is the wedding

265
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Sir, the day before yesterday

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I heard that the old gentleman was dying

267
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
It seems that we have to make a fool of ourselves

268
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
It's a wedding

269
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
It's also a knight

272
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Maybe in the future

273
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
What kind of good food are you looking for that blind man?

274
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200

Don't want to eat this kind of food in the future

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't be angry

288
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
You are angry

289

I have something to do.

395
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Where are you going?

396
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
It's none of your business.

397
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,600
You go home first.

398
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Bro, are you kidding me?

399
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
Bro, I told you.

400
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Let's wait here.

401
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Or go home.

402
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Bro, you'll be...

403
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,200
What if you get caught?

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Just...

405
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
Just once more.

406
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Miss, don't think too much.

407
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Grandpa Gu has caught that crazy guy.

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
He won't let him get away with it.

409
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,800
Miss, drink some water.

410
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
Are you hungry?

411
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Do you want to eat something?

412
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
I haven't eaten anything for a day.

413
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
How can I not be hungry?

414
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Then I'll get some fried food for you.

415
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
Miss, wait a minute.

416
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'll be right back.

417
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
You're back.

418
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
You again?

419
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
You don't remember me?

420
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
You're right.

421
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,600
You forgot about me.

422
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't have married You Huang.

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't have time to explain.

424
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Come with me.

425
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Don't come over.

426
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,800
Stay away from me.

427
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Are you leaving or not?

428
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
If you don't leave, you'll be on the ground.

429
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,800
Calm down.

430
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I don't mean anything to you.

431
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I won't hurt you.

432
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Are you leaving or not?

433
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
I haven't finished yet.

434
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm not leaving.

435
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Listen to me.

436
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,200
Everything you see in front of you is fake.

437
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
We're trapped in a painting.

438
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm going to save you.

439
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Think about how you're going to get out.

440
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
No, you...

441
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
You again?

442
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
You Huang, listen to me.

443
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Don't be afraid.

444
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I'm here.

445
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
How dare you?

446
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
You failed to get me married.

447
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,800
Now you're in my heart.

448
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
You want to molest my wife.

449
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
I should have killed you.

450
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
You're mistaken.

451
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,400
You two are not the kind of relationship you think.

452
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
You're being deceived.

453
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm mistaken?

454
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
We're not that kind of relationship.

455
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,400
What do you want to do?

456
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
It's not like that.

457
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
Wake up.

458
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
I'll wake up.

459
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
I'll help you wake up first.

460
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Brother, are you hurt?

461
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,000
What are you doing?

462
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Help me up.

463
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Okay.

464
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,600
Why are you so careless?

465
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
What's going on?

466
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
Why are you here?

467
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,600
We were talking about the job.

468
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Brother, are you stupid?

469
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,800
This is our brother's house.

470
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Where can we go if we're not here?

471
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Brother?

472
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Brother?

473
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
What's wrong?

474
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Is he crazy?

475
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Even if he's crazy,

476
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
it doesn't matter if he's handsome or not.

477
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
He's naughty.

478
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Brother, we have to go to work.

479
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
The time is almost up.

480
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
We have a day's work.

481
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Let's go, brother.

482
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Brother?

483
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Where are you going?

484
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Where are you going?

485
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Brother, are you going to buy buns on the street?

486
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
We'll buy some for you.

487
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
What?

488
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
We'll buy some for you.

489
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
We'll buy some for you.

490
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I'll buy some for you.

491
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Let's go.

492
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Let's go.

493
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Take your time.

494
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Damao.

495
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Damao.

496
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I just bought a big bun.

497
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I didn't have time to get it.

498
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Do you want 20 buns?

499
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Damao.

500
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I want 20 buns.

501
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
I want 20 buns.

502
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
I want 20 buns.

503
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Look at the sea, the real eye is strong.

504
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
The six seasons are really good.

505
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Look at the beauty of the sea, the flowers are small.

506
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
The wind can see the morning.

507
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Okay, repeat it.

508
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Look at the sea, the real eye is strong.

509
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
The six seasons are really good.

510
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
The six seasons are really good.

511
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Brother, what's the emergency?

512
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
You run so fast.

513
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
That's right.

514
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
We have to finish this job.

515
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
After this job, you'll have money to marry.

516
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
That's a good thing.

517
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
After we save enough money and marry my brother,

518
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
I'll be the second brother.

519
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
After the second brother is done, you'll be the third brother.

520
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
I have something important to do.

521
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
You go to work.

522
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I'll go first.

523
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Brother, let's finish this job first.

524
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Then we'll help you.

525
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Brother, we've paid the deposit.

526
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Brother, you're so picky.

527
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
You should go to find someone.

528
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
It's a big deal to delay the wedding.

529
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
You'll be beaten in the future.

530
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Brother, you're right.

531
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Third brother.

532
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Wait a minute.

533
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Look.

534
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
What are you looking at?

535
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I don't know.

536
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Brother.

537
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Where is my brother?

538
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Brother.

539
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Brother.

540
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Everyone.

541
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Come on.

542
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Share this wedding dress with everyone.

543
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Congratulations.

544
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Congratulations.

545
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Congratulations.

546
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Where is the priest?

547
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Thank you.

548
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I didn't see him this morning.

549
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Then why are you still standing here?

550
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Hurry up and find him.

551
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Hurry up.

552
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Hurry up.

553
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Help us find him.

554
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Come on.

555
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Sir, let me do it.

556
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
You must wear a hat.

557
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
When you go up and down the horse,

558
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
you have to straighten your waist.

559
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
So that others can see our style.

560
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
It's very annoying to get married.

561
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I'll think about it several times.

562
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Sir, don't think too much.

563
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I know.

564
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
What are you doing?

565
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Who let you in?

566
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
I just want to say a few words.

567
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I'll leave after I finish talking.

568
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Trust me.

569
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
You go out.

570
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes.

571
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Today is my big day.

572
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm in a good mood.

573
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
If you have any difficulties, just mention it.

574
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Why are you so impulsive?

575
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I don't need this.

576
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I just hope you can listen carefully.

577
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
I have something to say.

578
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Okay.

579
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Go ahead.

580
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
My real name is Jiuxuan Ye.

581
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Jiuxuan Ye is the mastermind of Ganshan Hall.

582
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
You don't have a surname.

583
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
You are just a subordinate.

584
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Your surname is Chu.

585
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Your name is You Huang.

586
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Chu You Huang.

587
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
This is not a city in the middle of nowhere.

588
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
This is a book store in the underground city.

589
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,600
The owner of this book store is a demon who is good at drawing.

590
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
This is a wide city in his drawing.

591
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Demon?

592
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Yes.

593
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You didn't believe it before.

594
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Until you saw the monster with a mirror.

595
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
After you ran away with your knife,

596
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
you believed that there was a demon in this world.

597
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
How could this happen?

598
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Now, not only we two are trapped in this painting,

599
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
but also Banxia,

600
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,600
the dance hall lady you are going to marry,

601
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,600
and the three brothers who are raising the sedan with me.

602
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
How is it?

603
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Do you remember anything?

604
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
No.

605
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Then you are suspecting what I just said.

606
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Isn't it obvious enough to suspect?

607
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
No.

608
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Although I still don't know the rules of this painting,

609
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I can prove one thing to you.

610
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
This is what my grandfather left me.

611
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
This is all fake.

612
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Do you know what you are doing?

613
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I am proving to you that in this painting,

614
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
everything that is destroyed will become what it was.

615
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
This is the ink.

616
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Do you understand?

617
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Yes.

618
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I understand now.

619
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
You understand?

620
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Then what are you going to do next?

621
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Guards!

622
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Arrest him!

623
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
What are you doing?

624
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Manager Yu, Manager Yu.

625
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Boss Zhang, please have a cup of tea.

626
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
It's him!

627
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
I saw you running.

628
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Why is it so noisy outside?

629
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
What happened?

630
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
A royal man's sedan just came in.

631
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Miss, it seems that he is looking for you.

632
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
sedan?

633
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Miss, do you know him?

634
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
How can I know him?

635
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Miss, the emergency is coming.

636
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Have you packed up?

637
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Yes, I have.

638
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Come.

639
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Stay here.

640
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Let's go.

641
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
The mirror is broken.

642
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
The couple is together.

643
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
The evil is broken.

644
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
The white hand is beautiful.

645
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
The injustice is different.

646
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Thank you, Young Master.

647
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Education is lifecycle for good health.

648
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,100
The three of them worship J acontecendo irre앵

649
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,300
and efforts to make it become together.

650
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,600
The ring is covered with roads.

651
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Sword procedures and marraige.

652
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
One

653
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Three.

654
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Big Brother, did you hurt your hand?

655
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
What are you doing? Hurry and help Big Brother up.

656
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Take the small one.

657
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Hurry.

658
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Okay.

659
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
What's wrong with you?

660
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I feel a little uncomfortable.

661
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I broke my hand.

662
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Big Brother, I'll find you a doctor.

663
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Big Brother, don't scare us.

664
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Okay.

665
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Am I your Big Brother?

666
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Yes.

667
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Then do you listen to me?

668
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Yes.

669
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,600
When Mother died, we all listened to Big Brother.

670
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Mother died and we all listened to Big Brother.

671
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Big Brother died and we all listened to Second Brother.

672
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Big Brother is not dead yet.

673
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Now we all listen to Big Brother.

674
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Okay, okay, okay.

675
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Big Brother has a favor to ask of you.

676
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Do you want to help?

677
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Help.

678
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
What are you talking about?

679
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
What help do we have between us?

680
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
If you have anything, just tell us.

681
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
That's right.

682
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
We are brothers.

683
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
We are brothers.

684
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Okay.

685
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
It's like this.

686
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Big Brother has been hiding something from you.

687
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
He didn't tell you.

688
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Big Brother has been hesitating whether to tell you.

689
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Big Brother, just tell us.

690
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Okay.

691
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
It's like this.

692
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
A few days ago, Big Brother went out.

693
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
After he went out...

694
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
When did he go out?

695
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I don't remember.

696
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
That's right.

697
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
We slept at home that day.

698
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Listen to me.

699
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600
A few days ago, I went out.

700
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600
I went to the south first.

701
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Then I went to the north.

702
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Anyway, I met a girl.

703
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
After I met that girl...

704
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,600
So Big Brother has a favorite girl.

705
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Big Brother has a crush on her.

706
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
He has a story.

707
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
It's true.

708
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
It seems that you are not that stupid.

709
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Big Brother, tell me.

710
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Which girl is she?

711
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
She is from Guangping.

712
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
What a coincidence.

713
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
It's a coincidence.

714
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
It's a coincidence.

715
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
We are familiar with Guangping.

716
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Which girl is her last name?

717
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Go find her.

718
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
The girl from the dance hall.

719
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Dance...

720
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Shut up.

721
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Which dance hall?

722
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Which dance hall?

723
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
He...

724
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
He's dance hall?

725
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Yes.

726
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Isn't that...

727
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,600
The bride we are going to bring later?

728
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Yes.

729
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Big Brother, are you crazy?

730
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Do you know who her husband is?

731
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
He is famous.

732
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Back then, in the foot of the mountain,

733
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,600
he killed more than ten bandits by himself.

734
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,600
He killed them without blinking.

735
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Big Brother, you are too cruel.

736
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Are you scared?

737
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
You are not going to help your big brother, right?

738
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
You are not going to listen to your mother?

739
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
I...

740
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I...

741
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
I am not scared.

742
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I am scared.

743
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Shut up.

744
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
We are not bandits.

745
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
We won't die even if we are caught.

746
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
I just want to say this.

747
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Will you go to the wedding with your big brother?

748
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
I...

749
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Good brother.

750
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
In my heart.

751
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
One brother and two people.

752
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
What do you two say?

753
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Brother, that's enough bullying.

754
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
We will go too.

755
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Okay.

756
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Big Brother really didn't see you wrong.

757
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
We are brothers.

758
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
We are brothers.

759
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
We are brothers.

760
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Congratulations.

761
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Congratulations.

762
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Thank you.

763
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

764
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Thank you for your hard work.

765
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Congratulations, Mr. Huang.

766
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Congratulations.

767
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Thank you.

768
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Congratulations.

769
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Congratulations.

770
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Wait a minute.

771
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Congratulations.

772
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Stop.

773
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
What is this?

774
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Ready.

775
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Hold it.

776
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Okay.

777
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
What's wrong with you?

778
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
What's wrong with you?

779
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
What's wrong with you?

780
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
What's going on?

781
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
These four guys haven't seen anything.

782
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Go after them.

783
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Go after them.

784
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Go after them.

785
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Wait a minute.

786
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Wait a minute.

787
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Stop.

788
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Stop.

789
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Come.

790
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Who are you?

791
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
You are not afraid of death?

792
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Sit tight.

793
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
I will explain to you later.

794
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Okay?

795
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Go.

796
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Brother, you smell so good.

797
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
You are asleep.

798
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Brother is asleep too.

799
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Brother is tired, right?

800
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Brother.

801
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Who is asleep?

802
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
You shut up.

803
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Brother is awake.

804
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Go out.

805
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Go out.

806
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Go out.

807
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Go out.

808
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Go out.

809
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Go!

810
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
You are awake.

811
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Where... where is this?

812
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
This is a ruined house.

813
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Why did you bring me here?

814
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
The people from the palace have not arrived yet.

815
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
You're the only one?

816
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Where are your friends?

817
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
They are outside.

818
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
So...

819
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Do you want to rob or kill?

820
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
None.

821
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Then you want to rob?

822
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Do you have any other questions to ask?

823
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
If not,

824
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I won't take it.

825
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,600
If not, just listen to me.

826
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Maybe the next words I say will make you feel

827
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
incredible and strange.

828
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
But I promise you that everything I say is true.

829
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I hope you can listen to me patiently

830
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
and then make a decision.

831
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Do you want to believe me?

832
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Can you?

833
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Okay.

834
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
You two, listen to me.

835
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
It's almost like this.

836
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
So you mean

837
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
my surname is not He, but Duan.

838
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Duan Banxia.

839
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Yes.

840
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,600
My parents are not my parents.

841
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
My husband is not my husband.

842
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Yes.

843
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I...

844
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
I...

845
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
We are trapped in a painting.

846
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,600
This painting is a monster painting.

847
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Yes.

848
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Do you think I believe you?

849
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Would you like to believe me?

850
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Although what you said is ridiculous,

851
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I don't know why.

852
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I just think I should believe you.

853
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Now you think so carefully.

854
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
It's true.

855
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
When I woke up this morning,

856
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,600
I had a headache.

857
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,600
I felt like I was dreaming.

858
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Yes.

859
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I felt the same on the first day.

860
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
And then

861
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
I did a lot of things

862
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
that I thought I knew them.

863
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,600
I felt a strange familiarity.

864
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I think you can

865
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
recover your memory soon.

866
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,600
But even if I remember everything,

867
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,600
we don't know how to get out.

868
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Actually, I've thought about it.

869
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
This painting

870
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
should be the longest painting in the house.

871
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
It's the work of the monster.

872
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
You, me,

873
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,600
You Huang and the three brothers outside

874
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
are trapped in this painting.

875
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
And your parents

876
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
are probably trapped here too.

877
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,600
This monster is so obsessed with your parents.

878
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
After a dozen years,

879
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,600
he sent that ship to take your father away.

880
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
I guess your parents

881
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
are the key to this painting.

882
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
They are important figures.

883
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
If we can find your parents,

884
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
we can find a way out.

885
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I think you're right.

886
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
You know what?

887
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I tried to wake up You Huang.

888
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
He didn't believe me.

889
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Luckily, you believed me.

890
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Of course I believe you.

891
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,600
But since this morning,

892
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I haven't had any water.

893
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Wait a minute.

894
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
I'll get you something to eat.

895
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Shut up.

896
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Do you think I'm a fool?

897
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Brother, does it hurt?

898
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Why are you standing there?

899
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Help him up.

900
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
What's wrong with you?

901
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I feel a little uncomfortable.

902
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Don't talk.

903
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Let me in.

904
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Brother, I'll find you a doctor.

905
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
I'm your brother.

906
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Do you listen to me?

907
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Yes.

908
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I'm sorry.

909
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Run.

910
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
What's going on?

911
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Run.

912
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
What's going on?

913
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
These four guys

914
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
haven't seen anything.

915
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Qu Lian?

916
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Qu Lian.

917
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Qu Lian.

918
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Excuse me.

919
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Excuse me.

920
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,600
What are you all kneeling here for?

921
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Are you waiting to see my clothes?

922
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Get up and get out.

923
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Find someone for me.

924
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Hurry up.

925
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Yes.

926
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Sir, calm down.

927
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
I'm not angry.

928
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
I'm just anxious.

929
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
As a member of the palace,

930
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
I must have offended a lot of people.

931
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
I'm afraid they'll take the opportunity to take revenge on you.

932
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Don't worry, sir.

933
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Now all the officials in the city are doing their best to take over.

934
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I believe we can find you soon.

935
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
No.

936
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Not enough.

937
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm not sure.

938
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

939
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm sorry.

942
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,600
I'm sorry.

943
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
The End

944
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
The End
