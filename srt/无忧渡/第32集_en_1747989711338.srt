1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
I won't play first in this video today.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,940
On this day, we've only gotten hers in a few days.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,000
And we've got to go to get her.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you blaming your father?

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,800
Xun Ye, it's not what you think.

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Your father has been protecting you from the beginning.

8
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,600
Twelve years ago,

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I met an accident in the underground city.

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Your father came to me

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
and I was lucky to meet you.

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I'll do it.

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Wake up.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,600
My father is a pharmacist.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,200
Why can't you see my medical condition?

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Yin Yin.

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
You're a talented man.

18
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Your waist is strong.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can't get hurt. No one can't see you.

20
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,600
So your father didn't treat you well.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And at that time, you were very heavy inside.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You forgot who you were.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So your father raised you as a family member.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This means that you are a 4th year.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And, Xueyi, you are so talented.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You are more suitable for training than your eldest brother.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your father was very happy. He thought he could find someone to pass on his memory.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So he sent you the magic of the whole life.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I didn't expect that after 4 years,

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the first time you went to the main temple with him,

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
he found out the truth.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,080
Zhu Xiaoyao

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Pretty girl, get me this습니다.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't...

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
I found out that you were a demon.

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Your father was in a state of shock and pain.

37
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,900
But he still loves you so much.

38
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,800
He can't let you go.

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
So, he made Bu Er Huan.

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,700
He wanted to seal your body with this.

41
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,800
But he still can't count the people.

42
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Xuan Yi, your father is already protecting you.

43
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,400
You are not in danger. Don't blame him.

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,900
Xuan Yi, I don't know either.

45
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
For you,

46
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,800
what is the best?

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
I made myself.

48
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,400
You are not well yet. You are thinking too much.

49
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,500
After being arrested in public,

50
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
take care of the wounded secretly.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You were severely hurt.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,800
They attacked too heavily.

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
It is a jade lantern.

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,200
It is sad that they warned the spirit to remind them.

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I'll see you get better after the treatment.

56
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
It's hard to control.

57
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Maybe I can help you to relieve your stress.

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
But before I completely recover,

59
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
you must remember to take good care of yourself.

60
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Come.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Okay.

62
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
By the way, uncle.

63
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Why did you come to see me?

64
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm not here to see you.

65
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm here to see you.

66
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Uncle.

67
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Why can't I control my body?

68
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I don't know.

69
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Maybe you've been under the care of Bo Erhuang for many years.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
You've been treated by the drug.

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Xuanyu.

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I have a question to ask you.

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Since you know your identity now,

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
what's your plan for the future?

75
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I don't know either.

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I thought about leaving the drugstore.

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Don't drag him down.

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Don't drag him down?

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
You said it very clearly.

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
But have you ever thought about it?

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
The person who stayed is not happy.

82
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
He may not be as happy as you are.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
He may not be as happy as you are.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
So.

85
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Uncle, please be serious.

86
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I have a question to ask you.

87
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
In the future,

88
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
do you want to be a human

89
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
or a drug?

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Mr. Gufest is younger than Bo.

91
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I am still small.

92
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
I think Dr. Bo will soon get back to the heart.

93
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Please.

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
You just won't stop, State Officer Zhao.

95
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Are you on something?

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
No, I'm not.

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
It's too cold.

98
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Are you waiting for us?

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
You're right.

100
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
We're waiting for Miss Duan.

101
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
How is she?

102
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
My master has been taking care of her.

103
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
I'll ask you something seriously.

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Do you want to be a human or a demon?

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Brother, someone is here to see you.

106
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Zhenyu.

107
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Are you okay?

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm fine.

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Why are you lying to me?

110
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Are you hurt?

111
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm fine.

112
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Why are you here?

113
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Did they make you feel uncomfortable?

114
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
No.

115
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Sister Sima and Chu Butou saved me from prison.

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Thank you.

117
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Xunyu, you don't have to see me.

118
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
We know that you're a good person.

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Humans have bad people.

120
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
It's good to have a demon.

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Xunyu.

122
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I brought you some blood.

123
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Can Xunyi be heard?

124
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Of course.

125
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I heard it, but I didn't hear it.

126
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Did you find out about that demon?

127
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Yes.

128
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
But he's very alert and powerful.

129
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm not sure about it.

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Forget it.

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It's not important.

132
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Xunyi is here.

133
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
The demon is not important.

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
We can catch him if we catch him.

135
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
We can't kill him if we can't catch him.

136
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Yes.

137
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
He can't ruin our master.

138
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
He's a good person.

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Master.

140
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I don't understand.

141
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
You said...

142
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
You said that the door to the prison

143
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
was opened once every 12 years.

144
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
How did the demon come out?

145
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Well.

146
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
The Xuanmao Clan is guarding the two gates.

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I think they have some special means

148
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
to let them get out of the prison.

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
But there must be a big limit to this.

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
If they come out,

151
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
they'll have one.

152
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Is he Xunyi's family?

153
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
At least he's the same.

154
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Master.

155
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
You can't take it anymore.

156
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I don't know.

157
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
I have a plan.

158
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I killed him.

159
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Xunyi.

160
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
My father took good care of him

161
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
when I was growing up in Ganshan.

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
But I didn't have a good day

163
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
after I got here.

164
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
My father passed away two years ago.

165
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I was so tired.

166
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I didn't have a good temper.

167
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Although I've thought about it

168
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
after a while,

169
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I don't have anything good to give him.

170
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I just need to have a child.

171
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Playing with me is good.

172
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I can't be a good person.

173
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm not good at playing with my mother.

174
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm very lazy.

175
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I can't stand being lazy.

176
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm very strict with him.

177
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm very sensitive to his daily life.

178
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Chi Hechuan

179
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
is not a very good person.

180
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
He just

181
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
followed me

182
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
for a year and a year.

183
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
When my mother passed away,

184
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
every spring and autumn festival

185
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
will give her new clothes.

186
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
But after I got here,

187
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I haven't bought her new clothes for a long time.

188
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Do you know

189
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
when we went to the hotel,

190
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I saw her pants were rotten.

191
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I wanted to buy her a new one.

192
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
But I didn't expect it.

193
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Xueyan.

194
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Anyway,

195
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Don't be so sad.

197
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
It's not your fault.

198
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Those two drugs killed her.

199
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Xueyan did it to protect you.

200
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I think

201
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
if I can replace you,

202
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
you will definitely

203
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
protect her forever, right?

204
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
By the way, Ba Xia.

205
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
When did you

206
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
know I was a drug?

207
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
When I saw you

208
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
in the wound,

209
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I was a little suspicious.

210
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
But I was sure

211
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
it was under the ground.

212
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
So early?

213
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Renyan.

214
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I know it's not good

215
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
to say it clearly.

216
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
But,

217
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I'm just afraid.

218
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm afraid you can't accept it.

219
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm afraid you'll be jealous

220
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
of us.

221
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
It's not your fault.

222
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I understand.

223
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm afraid you can't accept it.

224
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
It's all my fault.

225
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Who would have thought

226
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
a drug dealer

227
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
would be a demon?

228
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
These days,

229
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I've been thinking about

230
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
what I said before.

231
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
It's so ridiculous.

232
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Don't say that.

233
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Is a drug dealer so important?

234
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
It's also a drug.

235
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
You also regard it as family.

236
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
And the drug dealer,

237
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
he's not a good senior.

238
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
You are the one.

239
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
You're a good person

240
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
who can take care of me

241
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
and the people around you.

242
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
You're a good person.

243
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
You must remember.

244
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
It's a person.

245
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
You're a Xuanye.

246
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
It's a demon or Xuanye?

247
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I like the Xiaoxia family

248
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
because I like it.

249
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
It can't be changed

250
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
even if it's not changed.

251
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
But it's dangerous to be with me.

252
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Do you know that?

253
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
No, I just want to be with you.

254
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Don't want me to leave.

255
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I don't want to say

256
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
anything about the crown prince.

257
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Then I'll disappear.

258
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
If you dare to leave,

259
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I'll go to you.

260
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
You go to desert,

261
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I'll go with you to desert.

262
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
You go to grassland,

263
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I'll go to grassland to find you.

264
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
If you can't find me,

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I'll live like a beggar.

266
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
It's okay.

267
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I won't listen to you anyway.

268
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Do you hear me?

269
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
You haven't told me

270
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
why you don't live in Xiaodongpian.

271
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I don't like it.

272
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
You don't like it?

273
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Why?

274
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Xuanye's uncle

275
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
makes me feel uncomfortable.

276
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Uncomfortable?

277
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Do you know

278
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
why my crown prince is so fast?

279
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
The lord is the eldest.

280
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
The lord is the empress dowager's

281
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
beloved daughter.

282
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Not only that.

283
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
The lord is the crown prince's junior.

284
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
You want to fight?

285
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Of course.

286
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I can't leave

287
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
the personal effort of the four ministers.

288
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
After all,

289
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
no one has a good birth.

290
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Let go.

291
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Okay.

292
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Keep talking.

293
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I believe in my intuition.

294
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
And I'm sure

295
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
that if you're good or evil,

296
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
you'll be able to see

297
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
the eight-ninth-ninth-ninth-ninth.

298
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
The four ministers

299
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
are really good.

300
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Forget it.

301
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Come on.

302
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Eat while it's hot.

303
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm not hungry.

304
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
You're not hungry either.

305
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
You haven't eaten anything for two days.

306
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
You're not a monster.

307
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
How can you not eat?

308
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
A monster can eat nothing.

309
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I don't know either.

310
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I don't know either.

311
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I don't know either.

312
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't know either.

313
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I don't know either.

314
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I don't know either.

315
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I don't know either.

316
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I don't know either.

317
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I just know

318
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
that I have a lot of experience

319
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
but I don't have a few days to do it.

320
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
When I'm clear,

321
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I'll tell you

322
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
when I'm clear.

323
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
You can't help it.

324
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Eat quickly.

325
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I won't eat.

326
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
You eat quickly.

327
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Eat quickly.

328
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I can't finish it alone.

329
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
By the way,

330
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
how do you feel

331
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
when you were injured?

332
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Sister Sima

333
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
has helped me pack my things.

334
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
It's okay.

335
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
You've kept so many shoes

336
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
just to pack them.

337
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
How can you do that?

338
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Give me your arm.

339
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Let me check it.

340
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I told you

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
it's okay.

342
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Does it hurt?

343
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
It's okay.

344
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
It hurts.

345
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't hurt yourself.

346
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
It hurts.

347
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
It hurts.

348
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I was kidding.

349
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
It doesn't hurt.

350
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
You were injured so badly.

351
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
How could it not hurt?

352
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
It was so close.

353
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
You were caught.

354
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I didn't have time to think about it.

355
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You're still so silly.

356
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Just like when you were a kid.

357
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
How do you know that?

358
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
You remember it?

359
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
It's just that I remembered it

360
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
but it's not complete.

361
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Ba Xia.

362
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Can you tell me

363
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
how you entered the Wuyue Mirror?

364
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I told you

365
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I was taken away by the people

366
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
when I was a kid.

367
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I went to a place

368
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
that was dark.

369
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It was underground.

370
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
I ran away.

371
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I ran away.

372
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I don't know

373
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
how I met the Wuyue Mirror

374
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
you mentioned.

375
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Then I met you.

376
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Then where did you enter the Wuyue Mirror?

377
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I can't remember.

378
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
I only knew

379
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
that after we fell down

380
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
and woke up,

381
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I was already at home.

382
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
My father found me.

383
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
What about you?

384
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I was in Ganshan Hall when I woke up.

385
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
My father met me

386
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
in the underground city.

387
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I guess

388
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
we were in the underground city.

389
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I was in the underground city.

390
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I met me.

391
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I guess

392
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
after we fell into the Wuyue Mirror,

393
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
we came to the underground city

394
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
by the river.

395
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
At that time, I was seriously injured.

396
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I couldn't remember much.

397
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Then

398
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
my parents took me away.

399
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Here you are.

400
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Look.

401
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Are you hungry?

402
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Here, eat.

403
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Eat.

404
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Try chicken legs.

405
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
They smell so good.

406
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Four years later,

407
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
my father found that I was a demon.

408
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
He couldn't kill me

409
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
so he sealed my body with a second ring.

410
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
And he no longer allowed me

411
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
to go to the Demon Realm.

412
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
So that's how it is.

413
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
That means

414
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
the world in the painting

415
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
is not filled with the body.

416
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
That's why it's broken.

417
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Your father

418
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
should have left you

419
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
in the underground city

420
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
because of this.

421
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
He didn't let me go to the underground city

422
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
and he didn't let me be the main demon.

423
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
After he died,

424
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I was very sad.

425
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
I took my father's Cang Zhongxia

426
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
and took the demon everywhere.

427
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I was so tired.

428
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I remembered

429
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
a sentence my father said to me before he died.

430
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
A good man is a good evil.

431
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
A good demon is also a good evil.

432
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Even if your parents

433
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
and your brother

434
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
were killed by the demons,

435
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
you can't be so cruel

436
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
and blind.

437
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
You can't kill a demon

438
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
without asking for the body.

439
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Do you understand?

440
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
That's how it is.

441
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
I knew that after you were the demon,

442
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I had a grudge against your father.

443
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I thought

444
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
he was actually using his heart to heal.

445
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
I know.

446
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Xuan Ye.

447
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm sorry.

448
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
If it wasn't for me,

449
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
you wouldn't have come to the underground city.

450
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
You wouldn't have been in this trouble.

451
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
There is a God in the world.

452
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
I can't be blinded forever.

453
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
By the way,

454
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
how did you know

455
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I had a scar on my body?

456
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
You took off my clothes.

457
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
At that time,

458
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
we were not that close.

459
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
How long has it been?

460
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Why did you mention it?

461
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
I just suddenly thought

462
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I didn't know you well enough.

463
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
If I take you back like this,

464
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

465
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Why are you so surprised?

466
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
You said that.

467
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Can I abandon you?

468
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Do you really want me

469
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
to be your beggar

470
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
and look for me all over the world?

471
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Why are you crying again?

472
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You promised me.

473
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
You promised me

474
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
that you would never leave me

475
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
after you said it.

476
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
You are a man with a big husband.

477
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
You said you wanted to be my beggar.

478
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Did you hear me?

479
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Alright.

480
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
But, Daxia,

481
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
before you came,

482
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I thought a lot.

483
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I thought about you

484
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
and your love for me.

485
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I thought about you

486
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
and your love for me.

487
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
I thought about myself

488
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
and my father.

489
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I was in a mess.

490
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
I didn't know how to get out of it.

491
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
But even so,

492
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I didn't think about it.

493
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I didn't think about

494
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
how I would live my life in the future.

495
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I didn't think about

496
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
how I would go on the path of my future.

497
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
But I can promise you

498
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
that I will do whatever I want

499
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
to make you my beggar.

500
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Alright?

501
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Alright.

502
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Master.

503
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
You are a government official.

504
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
You are going to fight with the evil.

505
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
You are going to kill me?

506
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
You are going to kill me?

507
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I didn't kill you.

508
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
So, I am not a government official.

509
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
I am just a beggar.

510
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I am just a beggar.

511
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I am just a beggar.

512
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I am just a beggar.

513
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
I am just a beggar.

514
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I am just a beggar.

515
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
I am a friend of Jiuxuan Ye

516
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
and Chi Xue.

517
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I am Jiang Shangyun.

518
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
The one I killed

519
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
is the demon!

520
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
You killed Chi Xue.

521
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I should have killed you.

522
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
But you said you were a demon.

523
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
I am a demon.

524
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
You used to think that

525
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
I was the one who killed the kid.

526
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
That's why you are so familiar with me.

527
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
It's a pity.

528
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
So, I didn't kill you.

529
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
But you are too impulsive.

530
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,700
If you don't break the clear red, you'll be punished.

531
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,200
A person with a hard brain doesn't deserve to have the strength.

532
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,700
So I'm wasting your time.

533
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,200
I hope you'll be careful in the future.

534
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
If you mess with the people and put them in my hands,

535
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,700
I won't let you suffer.

536
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Let's go.

537
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Let's go.

538
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,700
I thought you'd kill them.

539
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
You want to?

540
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,200
In my opinion, we should put them in prison first.

541
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,700
And then we'll put them in a hospital.

542
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,700
But Lord Geng doesn't want to investigate them.

543
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,200
The first person to kill someone is the one who's destined to die.

544
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,200
But how to deal with the monster?

545
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
The law doesn't say anything.

546
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Are you okay?

547
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm fine.

548
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Then go back first.

549
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
I'm fine.

550
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
Did you catch them?

551
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
No, Master.

552
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Wait a minute.

553
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
How are you?

554
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
I'm fine.

555
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Master, the one who saved him before seems to be the little East Sea's owner.

556
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,200
I know.

557
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Then why don't you say anything?

558
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
What are you saying?

559
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
They're obviously alive.

560
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,700
The little East Sea's owner is Cai Xiong.

561
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,700
It's a good thing that we two are not in the same boat.

562
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
But the wind and water are flowing.

563
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,700
In this world, the monster's sect is not only a family of eight.

564
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Sooner or later, I'll kill them.

565
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Why are you two so romantic?

566
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Master Yu.

567
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Why are you here?

568
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,200
Of course, I'm here to see you, Master Jiang.

569
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Tuo, let's go.

570
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
How did Master Jiang act in front of us?

571
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
We've known each other for years.

572
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Business has always been good.

573
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,200
I always thought we were friends.

574
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I also always thought we were the same kind of people.

575
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
That day, your master saved the monster.

576
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I thought you two would kill him,

577
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
but you two let him go.

578
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Why?

579
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
The monster is a disciple.

580
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,700
Don't you two hate the monster the most?

581
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
That's right.

582
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
We're not in the same boat with the monster.

583
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
This will never change.

584
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Then why did you let him go?

585
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Master Jiang, I really admire you.

586
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,700
Unfortunately, Master Jia is not here.

587
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
You know too much.

588
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
You're always a bad guy.

589
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
But don't worry.

590
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
After you die,

591
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,200
I'll come down and bury you.

592
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
To kill Master Chu Yao,

593
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
you're a dead person.

594
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Master Jiang,

595
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Hurry up!

597
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Master!

598
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Go!

599
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,700
Light S этим

600
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,200
Master, you've finished doing everything?

601
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I have finished.

602
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,280
Do you feel sorry for me?

603
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,660
Yes.

604
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,040
I take this as a tribute,

605
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,580
by cámara,

606
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,760
to barefoot.

607
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,680
I do feel sorry for that.

608
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,620
Even demons can wake F contributions.

609
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,760
There they are.

610
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
Come...

611
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,880
Come,

612
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,800
and have the shame.

613
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
It's strange. How is the wound?

614
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,800
It's better now.

615
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Is it good?

616
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Yes.

617
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
It doesn't look good.

618
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Throw it down.

619
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Yes.

620
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
No.

621
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Why did you kill me?

622
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
If you don't, you're not capable.

623
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Throw it down.

624
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I didn't hurt anyone.

625
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
I didn't do anything.

626
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Master, it's almost done.

627
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
There's one more.

628
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
You're awake.

629
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Did you sleep for a long time?

630
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
No.

631
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
I didn't sleep for a long time.

632
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,800
A day and a night?

633
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
So long?

634
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Maybe you're too tired.

635
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Are you here?

636
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Ban Xia, do you know that you talk in a dream when you're asleep?

637
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
No.

638
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
My mom said I sleep well.

639
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
I sleep well.

640
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Okay.

641
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Are we leaving?

642
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Yes.

643
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
We're going to Guangping.

644
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
You've broken my identity.

645
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm afraid you'll forget it.

646
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,800
We can't go back to Guangping for now.

647
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I'm sorry.

648
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
It's not your fault.

649
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I'm injured.

650
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
I can't stay here.

651
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
We'll find a place to stay.

652
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
When I'm recovered, I'll go back to Nanyang with you.

653
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
You want to go back to Nanyang with me?

654
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,800
No matter what, I owe your parents an explanation.

655
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Don't think about it.

656
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
You should take good care of yourself.

657
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
You're leaving?

658
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Yes.

659
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Xunyi, you're not recovered.

660
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,800
People outside know you're the monster who saved you.

661
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Where else can you go besides me?

662
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Do you want to go back to Ganshan Hall?

663
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Don't worry, uncle.

664
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I'm not ready to go back to Ganshan Hall.

665
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
What's your plan?

666
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I have no plan.

667
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I want to find a place to stay.

668
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Then stay here.

669
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
What other place is safer than here?

670
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Xunyi, do you think it's not comfortable to stay in the underground city?

671
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,800
If you have any ideas, just tell me.

672
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Thank you for your concern.

673
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,800
After all, I can't hide here for the rest of my life.

674
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Besides, I have some things to deal with.

675
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Ye Hao,

676
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,800
we're not very good at keeping our bodies in the underground city.

677
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Just leave if you want to.

678
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,800
If you find any trouble outside, just come to me.

679
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Xunyi,

680
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,800
you should remember that I'm always your uncle.

681
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Besides, you must remember what I told you.

682
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,800
You must believe in God's will.

683
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
If you want to, you must have a choice.

684
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Thank you, uncle.

685
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
I've made up my mind.

686
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Then we'll leave first.

687
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Let's go.

688
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Master,

689
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
you let us go like this?

690
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
What else can we do?

691
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
You're going to kill him right here?

692
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Don't forget that

693
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
there are two secret guards outside.

694
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
What should we do next?

695
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Find another security guard.

696
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Yes.

697
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
I want to stay here alone.

698
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Do you need me to stay with you?

699
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
No.

700
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Come out.

701
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Do you understand?

702
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
You're not human.

703
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
You must never be human.

704
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
You killed Chi Xuan?

705
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
No.

706
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
The one who killed him was not me.

707
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
It was you.

708
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
If you wanted to go back with me,

709
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
you wouldn't have done that.

710
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
What?

711
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Are you going to take revenge?

712
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
You're a thief.

713
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
You're going to kill your brother

714
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
for a rabbit demon?

715
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Brother Qin.

716
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Ma Ying,

717
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
when are you going to stop me?

718
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
You're a human.

719
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
You're your family.

720
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Don't you have no right to be a good man?

721
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
We've seen each other many times.

722
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Have you ever asked your father

723
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
whether he has ever asked for security?

724
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
I don't remember what you said.

725
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
You'll remember it sooner or later.

726
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Or you've already remembered it.

727
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
You just don't want to admit it.

728
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
You're the father.

729
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
You're the leader of the decision-making team.

730
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
You must go back.

731
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I don't want to be a leader.

732
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
If you want to be,

733
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
go ahead.

734
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
I don't want to be.

735
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
You said you don't want to be.

736
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Do you know what blood and blood

737
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
on your body represents?

738
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Father is old.

739
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
He can't bear for long.

740
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Wuyou Sect has been under siege for years.

741
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
We've never been able to do anything.

742
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
You're the first son of the Xuan Bao Clan.

743
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
You're a great leader.

744
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
You're the leader of the Wuyou Sect.

745
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
You're the leader of the whole team.

746
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
That's your responsibility.

747
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
You said you don't want to be.

748
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I can't hear you.

749
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Xuan Ye.

750
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
You really let me down.

751
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
You're not worthy of being the leader of the Xuan Bao Clan.

752
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
And you're not worthy of being my brother.

753
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
From now on,

754
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
I won't bother you anymore.

755
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Who is that?

756
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
It's a bit messy.

757
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I haven't cleaned up.

758
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
But

759
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
I don't know what's going on

760
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
in Guangping.

761
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
So I can only go to Wei for now.

762
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Let's stay here and have a look.

763
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
It's good.

764
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
I'll go get some water

765
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
and clean up.

766
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
I'll go get some water.

767
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
I'll go get some water.

768
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I'll clean up.

769
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Let me help you.

770
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
No need.

771
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
You're still injured.

772
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
You're injured, too.

773
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
You two can rest.

774
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I'll do it.

775
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Sister Sima is such a hard worker.

776
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Isn't there a yellow one?

777
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
You should be careful.

778
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
You're not good at working.

779
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm just sitting there.

780
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
It's a bit cold.

781
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I don't know if I can help you.

782
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Why should I help you?

783
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
You're not my husband.

784
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Besides,

785
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,800
if you become my husband one day,

786
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
I'll be more than happy to have you.

787
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,800
You're the one who's doing the household chores.

788
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
You should use it as a reminder.

789
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Thank you.

790
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Go to bed.

791
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Have some water.

792
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Come.

793
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
You're not doing anything.

794
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
You're just drinking water.

795
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Fan Xia,

796
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'll go to the town

797
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
and buy some furniture for you.

798
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
You can buy some food.

799
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
I'll go.

800
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Of course.

801
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
There's nothing to do.

802
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
You need to pick up a lot of stuff.

803
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
You can't do it alone.

804
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I'll go with him later.

805
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Did you ask me?

806
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
I'll ask you now.

807
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
I'll ask you now.

808
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Are you going?

809
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Fine.

810
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
I'll go with you.

811
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Fan Xia,

812
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
don't do the household chores.

813
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Let's go back.

814
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Wait for us.

815
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Hurry up.

816
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Let's go.

817
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
I'm sorry.

818
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,800
I'm sorry.

819
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
I'm sorry.

820
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
I'm sorry.
