[Episode 28]

3
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,870
Welcome back.

4
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,710
Sir,

5
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,430
what tune is this?

6
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,170
It sounds melancholy.

7
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
It's a long-lost tune from the past.

8
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Its name

9
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,120
has long been forgotten.

10
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,800
This melody has lyrics.

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Would you like to listen?

12
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,810
Yes, I would.

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,190
♫The gloomy, windy, rainy day♫

14
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,280
♫Tears fall gently♫

15
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,240
♫Missing my love who's away♫

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,430
♫Melancholy grows silently♫

17
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,430
♫The Qin and Se play a melody♫

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,560
♫With the tune echoing♫

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,710
♫We crossed paths not accidentally♫

20
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,290
♫My love's still not realizing♫

21
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,910
♫We crossed paths not accidentally♫

22
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,020
♫My love's still not realizing♫

23
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,840
Sir,

24
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,410
this song is beautiful.

25
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,130
Could you teach it to me?

26
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,860
Did everything go smoothly at Liushui Pavilion today?

27
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,579
Yes.

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,840
No one noticed that

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,700
the Qin player had been replaced.

30
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Good.

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,680
Besides,

32
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,190
with your magical spell,

33
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
ordinary patrons

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,690
couldn't tell the difference.

35
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,120
By the way,

36
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,680
that person showed up today as expected.

37
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,910
He sat in the corner,

38
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,590
thinking I hadn't noticed him.

39
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,120
And he left as soon as the performance ended.

40
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,480
Just as you said.

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
he was there to keep an eye on you.

42
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,630
Sir, you are a demon.

43
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Why would you fear a mere mortal?

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,540
Demon hunters work to eliminate demons.

45
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,240
Of course they have some skills.

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,870
We can't

47
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,420
see them as "mere mortals."

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,000
He's got plenty of tricks

49
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,310
up his sleeve to deal with me.

50
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,160
What tricks?

51
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,040
Sorry, sir.

52
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,409
I didn't mean it.

53
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,440
I think

54
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,159
he won't give up easily.

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,770
Let me take your place again

56
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
for tomorrow's show at Liushui Pavilion.

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,560
Okay.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Sir,

59
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,990
I'd like a bowl of cold tea.

60
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,430
Ms. Cui!

61
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,470
Stop there!

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,310
Get him!

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,430
Stop there!

64
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,920
Ms. Cui!

65
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,510
Ms. Cui, don't let go!

66
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,490
Help me.

67
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,780
Xuanye!

68
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,820
Xuanye,

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,870
I made it!

70
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,530
What did you do?

71
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,140
Well,

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,070
I...

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,760
I... Ms. Cui...

74
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,460
It's about Ms. Cui...

75
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,030
Take a breath. No rush.

76
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,540
In a nutshell, the situation

77
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,340
isn't as set in stone as you said.

78
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,790
What you told me last time

79
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
wasn't completely correct.

80
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,670
Do you remember that

81
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,130
I could see the white crow?

82
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,940
Just now, because I

83
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,610
saw it,

84
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,500
I saved Ms. Cui.

85
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,370
Well, we were walking on a bridge,

86
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,040
and

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Ms. Cui was near the edge of that bridge.

88
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,950
Then a thief came

89
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,090
and made her...

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,400
What's wrong?

91
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,159
The white crow.

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,310
This bird...

93
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,830
No,

94
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,040
why is this crow

95
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
standing on my shoulder?

96
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,510
This is the curse of the white crow.

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Curse?

98
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,560
Last time, Mr. Wen

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,430
was saved by the Nine Lives.

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
But now he's dead.

101
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,130
I will protect you.

102
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,060
Banxia,

103
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,190
this is not a joke.

104
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,140
From now on,

105
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,450
you must stay by my side

106
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,270
at all times

107
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,550
until I find a way to save you.

108
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,870
Got it?

109
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,540
I'll do as you say.

110
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,990
What's wrong?

111
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,070
This white crow

112
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,920
is quite heavy on my shoulder.

113
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,240
I can't breathe.

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,940
The white crow is a spirit.

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,970
It has no weight.

116
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,560
It is heavy!

117
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,190
Fine, it's heavy.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,060
Have some soup now.

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,070
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,450
I moved recklessly,

121
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,430
causing you to worry about me.

122
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,630
Things have developed to this point

123
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,390
because

124
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,660
you've been cursed by the white crow,

125
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,420
not because

126
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,490
you saved Ms. Cui.

127
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Banxia,

128
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,190
remember that

129
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,800
no matter what,

130
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,440
trying to save someone is never wrong.

131
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,190
You might experience

132
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,850
some hardships along the way,

133
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,940
but it'll always end up well.

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,510
Is there

135
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,799
still a way out for me at this point?

136
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,750
In this world,

137
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,130
all beings

138
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,190
are connected,

139
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,870
and so are the curses.

140
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
But if we can sever

141
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,750
the connection between you and the white crow,

142
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,680
we might be able to break the curse.

143
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,740
The connection between me and the white crow...

144
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,730
You received

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,770
the white crow from Chi Wangchuan.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,130
What if you didn't know Chi Wangchuan?

147
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,960
Or if

148
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,720
Chi Wangchuan hadn't taken the white crow

149
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,050
as his companion demon,

150
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,580
would all these things

151
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
have never happened?

152
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,670
There's an even more direct method.

153
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,910
Kill the white crow.

154
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,560
But didn't you say that,

155
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,170
as a spirit, the white crow wouldn't die?

156
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,840
That was the case.

157
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,880
But if we draw on

158
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,970
a weapon that can destroy causality,

159
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,350
we'll be able to kill it.

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,960
A weapon that can destroy causality...

161
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,750
Is that kind of thing even real?

162
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,540
But whether it will succeed

163
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,680
depends on fate.

you were deliberately saying hurtful things to me,

193
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,550
right?

194
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Then I'll take it as you didn't mean it.

195
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,740
No matter why

196
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,010
you said those words,

197
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,390
I forgive you.

[Recruitment]

212
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,870
Cui,

213
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,000
isn't it good to be a blacksmith?

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,840
If you pick up

215
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,320
this trade properly from Blacksmith Li,

216
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,960
our future

217
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,820
will be secure.

218
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,020
Don't you think so?

219
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,320
My Lady,

220
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,750
I just heard something

221
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,950
about Physician Jiu.

222
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,470
What is it?

223
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,180
Someone is setting him up with a girl.

224
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,730
Physician Jiu,

225
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,720
you may not know me,

226
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,910
but I know you.

227
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,510
I heard from Madam Wang that

228
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,570
you're neither married nor engaged.

229
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,720
You're already 24, not young anymore.

230
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,790
I have a younger sister.

231
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,510
She's 21,

232
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,320
gentle, pretty,

233
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,840
just not in good health.

234
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,880
But you're a physician.

235
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,680
Aren't you a perfect match?

236
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,810
How about it?

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,680
You might not know much about me.

238
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,690
My husband is from the Cui family.

239
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,750
He's a blacksmith,

240
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,310
and his family is well-off.

241
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,320
My sister

242
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,240
is adept and efficient at work.

243
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,370
She's definitely good enough for you.

244
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,720
You once treated my mother-in-law,

245
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,510
so our whole family

246
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,840
knows you quite well.

247
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,790
As for the rumor out there,

248
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,080
saying that your five family members

249
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,040
were all murdered,

250
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,640
we don't believe that at all.

251
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,480
You're a handsome and decent man.

252
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,810
It's such a waste if you don't get married.

253
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,140
If you're interested,

254
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,880
I can bring her over

255
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,140
this afternoon.

256
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,390
If you two

257
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,240
hit it off,

258
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,870
I can immediately have someone

259
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,870
arrange the wedding.

260
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,320
You'll have a wife then.

261
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,600
If he's marrying anyone, it's me,

262
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,630
not your sister.

263
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,570
Who are you?

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,870
And who are you?

265
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,870
I'm Physician Jiu's patient.

266
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm Physician Jiu's love.

267
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,380
His love?

268
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,790
Lady, you look so young,

269
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,310
yet you're saying something

270
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,160
so shameless?

271
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,510
You haven't woken up from

272
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,910
last night's dream, huh?

273
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,760
You're the one who's still dreaming! Just ask him.

274
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,730
Physician Jiu,

275
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,900
this can't be true, right?

276
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,870
I-It's true.

277
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,060
But the constable said you weren't engaged.

278
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,800
Well, it's happening soon.

279
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,270
Sorry for not getting the full picture.

280
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:48,870
Miss,

281
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I apologize.

282
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,500
Here, your medicine.

283
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,320
Thank you.

284
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:57,930
Oh, right,

285
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,700
decoct it at home based on the instructions.

286
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay.

287
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,680
I'm not usually this rude.

288
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,750
No wonder.

289
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,410
Why do you sound so sarcastic?

290
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,420
No wonder you don't want to be my boyfriend.

291
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,350
Turns out you want to marry

292
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,210
the blacksmith's family member.

293
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,390
This sword of yours

294
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,840
is a treasure.

295
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,640
How can you...

296
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,510
Xuanye.

297
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,370
I-It's broken?

298
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,670
It...

299
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,840
I-It wasn't me, was it?

300
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,600
Well, um...

301
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,870
Xuanye,

302
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,300
did you use the Real-felicity Sword?

303
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,560
So this Real-felicity Sword

304
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,850
is the fourth sword?

305
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,310
There are five swords in total in the Hidden Dragon Case.

306
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,470
You've only seen

307
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,550
the Greedy Wolf, Mountain Shaker, and Fire Swords before.

308
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,329
Actually, there are two more swords.

309
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,609
They are Real-felicity and Origin-returning.

310
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,200
But the way to draw these two swords

311
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,130
is very special.

312
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
So I've never drawn them out before.

313
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,790
That's why you've never seen them.

314
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,780
Just now, your touch on the Hidden Dragon Case

315
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,670
caused a crack

316
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,160
in its outer shell.

317
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,890
This is the trace left behind

318
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,510
after using the Real-felicity Sword.

319
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,110
So,

320
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,080
it's very likely that

321
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,440
I've severed one

322
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,680
of your causality relationships.

323
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,480
Why did you sever one

324
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,890
of my causality relationships?

325
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,400
It's very likely that you ran into danger,

326
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,750
and things were too complicated

327
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,670
and severe

328
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,000
for me to fix,

329
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,520
so I used the Real-felicity Sword.

330
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,590
But according to what you just said,

331
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,310
you've never drawn

332
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,160
the Real-felicity Sword before, right?

333
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,220
My father said that

334
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,000
in the Eight Pillar Sect, only the founder

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
once drew the Real-felicity Sword.

336
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,760
He said it was related to a celestial phenomenon,

337
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,320
but I don't know which one

338
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,750
exactly.

339
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
That powerful?

340
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,510
Hold on.

341
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,960
When you used other swords before,

342
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,560
there was always a backlash.

343
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,110
Then what's the backlash

344
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,790
of this one?

345
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,920
Stand up now.

346
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,160
Let me check.

347
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,950
Causality is the greatest backlash.

348
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,420
A single move can beget a chain reaction.

349
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,130
Sometimes,

350
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,280
a small change

351
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,570
can overturn a person's entire life.

352
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,300
Perhaps we have already lost

353
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,790
something very important

354
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,410
without even realizing it.

355
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,260
Real-felicity, Real-felicity.

356
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,800
No cause, no effect.

357
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,340
Only then can one obtain real felicity.

358
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,430
How unique this sword is.

359
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,750
Have you two made up?

360
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,930
If so, make me something to eat now.

361
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,540
Banxia,

362
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,720
Xuanye's cooking

363
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,830
has caused me to lose

364
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,630
quite a lot of weight these days!

365
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,720
Who's made up with him?

366
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,450
Guess you have to keep starving.

367
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,410
It makes you feel much happier.

368
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

369
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,650
What a brilliant performance.

370
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,490
Is that musician on stage

371
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,110
Mr. Bai, Bai Ning?

372
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,160
Yes.

373
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,010
Mr. Bai, please hold on.

374
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,220
An esteemed guest wished to meet you.

375
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,570
This is a greeting gift.

376
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,070
Please enjoy.

377
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,940
I'm fortunate today

378
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,530
to have enjoyed your Qin performance.

379
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,050
It was as clear and beautiful as pure jade

380
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,270
and lotus dew.

381
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,780
It deserves to be called "unparalleled."

382
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,290
I'm flattered, sir.

383
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,190
Actually, I don't know much about Qin music,

384
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,030
but my master says your playing is fabulous.

385
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,360
So it must be good.

386
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,240
Your master?

387
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,000
Qin Xuanzhi, Vice Minister of Rites.

388
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,940
Mr. Bai, please don't be nervous.

389
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,340
I'm here to ask you a favor this time.

390
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,130
In half a month,

391
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,220
there will be a royal poetry banquet.

392
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,000
All the scholars who passed the imperial exam

393
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,240
will attend it,

394
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,920
where they'll compose poems and enjoy wine in front of flowers.

395
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,650
At that time,

396
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,550
His Majesty will also attend the banquet

397
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,560
to pick talent for the state.

398
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,510
With nice poems and fine wine,

399
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,700
how could there be no good music to match?

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,730
So His Majesty issued a decree,

401
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,190
ordering my master

402
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
to seek one of the best musicians of our time

403
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,310
to play at the banquet.

404
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,740
So

405
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
you chose me?

406
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
After this banquet,

407
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
you will be His Majesty's musician.

408
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,200
That means the world's

409
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,240
top-class Qin master.

410
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,750
I believe your name

411
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,960
will be well-known

412
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,540
to literally everyone

413
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,750
who plays the Qin.

414
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,800
Madam Tang.

415
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,200
Xuanye.

416
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,300
Is Mr. Duan at home?

417
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,400
Mr. Duan,

418
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
I've changed my mind.

419
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,590
Banxia still needs to be with me.

420
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,590
You already promised me.

421
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,240
Yes,

422
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,590
I know

423
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,330
you don't want Banxia to be in danger.

424
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,680
But this is exactly why

425
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
I can't leave her.

426
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,750
Why?

427
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,240
I agreed

428
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,130
to leave Banxia

429
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,160
because

430
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,120
I thought if I wasn't around,

431
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,840
she would be safe and sound,

432
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
not disturbed by demons.

433
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,210
But now it turns out that

434
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,110
I was wrong.

435
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,480
You're well aware of Banxia's constitution.

436
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,340
And as you know,

437
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,350
when you two

438
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,510
were missing,

439
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,550
Banxia went through a lot,

440
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,030
like hardships and dangers.

441
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,830
Now she's even

442
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,430
more susceptible to demons.

443
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,250
So after much consideration,

444
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,510
I still think

445
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,790
it's safer for Banxia

446
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,960
to stay with me.

447
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
I am a demon hunter

448
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,350
who messes with demons frequently.

449
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,080
That's true.

450
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,740
But that's exactly why

451
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,200
I am the one who can protect Banxia.

452
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,100
You saved my life. There's no need to kneel before me.

453
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,340
You are Banxia's father,

454
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,870
so of course I should kneel.

455
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
I swear on my life that

456
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,940
as long as I'm still alive,

457
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm not letting anyone

458
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,240
lay a finger on Banxia.

459
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,700
I'll use every last one of my faculties to protect her for life.

460
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,170
So, Mr. Duan, I hope

461
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,990
you will allow Banxia and me to be together.

462
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,310
Sir.

463
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,870
Welcome back.

464
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,790
Someone was looking for you at Liushui Pavilion today.

465
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,650
Would you care to guess who it was?

466
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,140
It was

467
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,180
the butler of Vice Minister Qin from the Ministry of Rites.

468
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,920
He said

469
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,830
Vice Minister Qin has long

470
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,920
admired your Qin playing.

471
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,160
He'd like to invite you to a poetry banquet

472
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,800
to perform for His Majesty.

473
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,070
Sir,

474
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,310
you don't want to?

475
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,180
Spending my days making tea, playing the Qin,

476
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,400
seeing the one I care about,

477
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,490
and living a peaceful life

478
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,930
is already a blessing.

479
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,300
The bustling and fancy Shendu

480
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,720
isn't a place for me.

481
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,070
But you

482
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,070
have never been to Shendu, have you?

483
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,650
I may not have been there, but I've heard about it.

484
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,440
Shendu does abound

485
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,720
with masters and talent.

486
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,240
There, you'll find way more people

487
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,970
who understand music and rhythm than in Guangping.

488
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,440
However, those who truly listen with their hearts

489
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,560
are very few.

490
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,850
Because in that place,

491
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,020
no matter how outstanding one's Qin playing is,

492
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,240
it's no more than a tool for the powerful

493
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,100
to show off their cultured taste.

494
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,590
B-But...

495
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,140
You really want to go, huh?

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,790
No way.

497
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,570
You're the one they're inviting, Mr. Bai.

498
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,280
It has nothing to do with me.

499
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,790
Moreover,

500
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,370
my playing

501
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,340
is nowhere near qualified for that banquet.

502
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,610
I just find it such a pity for you.

503
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,270
I-It'd be such a shame

504
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,820
to give up this opportunity

505
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,140
to make a name for yourself.

506
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,790
If your love for the Qin is real,

507
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,920
you should know that

508
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,600
living peacefully and playing the Qin freely

509
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,940
matters much more than fame and reputation.

510
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,430
Starting tomorrow,

511
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,250
I'll go to Liushui Pavilion.

512
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,110
Have a good rest.

513
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,230
Yes.

514
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,720
Sir.

515
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,790
If there's anything you'd like to eat

516
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,640
or have,

517
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
you can tell me in advance,

518
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,830
and I'll bring it for you when I return.

519
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,680
I want nothing.

520
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,540
Thank you, sir.

521
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,030
I've thought it over carefully.

522
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,720
You're right, sir.

523
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,130
My mind's been flooded with distractions.

524
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,790
Now I should

525
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,530
focus on honing my Qin playing.

526
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,880
Take care on your journey, sir.

527
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,610
I'll stay and won't see you off.

528
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,790
Okay.

529
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,030
I haven't eaten for two days,

530
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,300
yet I haven't lost any weight at all.

531
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,900
I can only eat some pears now.

532
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,740
How can you not have a proper meal?

533
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,610
No matter what,

534
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,730
you should at least eat properly.

535
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,920
It'll be bad if you mess up

536
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,680
your health.

537
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,290
Honestly, I've always

538
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,620
thought you look great the way you are now.

539
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
If you get skinnier,

540
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,000
you won't be as cute anymore.

541
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:01,930
Banxia,

542
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,240
that Matchmaking Tree is really famous.

543
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,190
[Blessing and Fortune]

544
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,830
Let's go take a look.

545
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,370
Banxia,

546
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,830
let's go draw a fortune stick.

547
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,750
You go ahead.

548
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,170
I think I see an old acquaintance.

549
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,340
Then come and join me soon.

550
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,110
Greetings, lady.

551
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,250
We meet again.

552
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,410
Are you here for a divination?

553
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,120
Why are you still here, sir?

554
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,680
After getting out of the painting,

555
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,140
I returned to Mount Bodhi.

556
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,000
The mountain is still the same, but the Taoist temple is gone.

557
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,660
I didn't see my master either.

558
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,550
It's said that a flash flood occurred 60 years ago,

559
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,980
crushing everything.

560
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,550
Then what's your plan?

561
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,980
The time spent inside the painting can't be retrieved.

562
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,180
When you got out of it,

563
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
your family and friends were also gone.

564
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,200
Time flies, bringing vicissitudes.

565
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,680
Everything in the world unfolds

566
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,940
based on natural laws.

567
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,880
I am merely

568
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,400
following these laws.

569
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,230
Please have a seat, lady.

570
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,240
Don't be sad, lady.

571
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,830
Now that fate has let us meet again,

572
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,640
let me do a divination for you.

573
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,790
Think of something and repeat it three times in your mind.

574
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,400
Initial nine, plain shoes, going forward with no disaster.

575
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,220
Judging from this hexagram,

576
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
your concerns

577
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,130
can only be resolved through sincerity and honesty.

578
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,840
This divination is about fate,

579
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,760
not for money.

580
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,240
Please

581
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,210
take it back, lady.

582
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,440
Okay.

583
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,550
Then if you need any help in the future,

584
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,510
you can find me at the mansion next to

585
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,160
the Ganshan Clinic, Sifang Street.

586
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,030
I live there.

587
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,590
Please don't worry about

588
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,720
or feel sorry for me, lady.

589
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,920
Though the real world

590
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,510
is not as good as the fake one

591
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,720
inside that painting,

592
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,400
it makes me feel alive,

593
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
fulfilled, proud,

594
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,850
and full of spirit.

595
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,590
Master,

596
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,710
could you interpret this fortune stick?

597
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,350
Thank you for your offer, sir.

598
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,240
I'm willing to go with you to Shendu.

599
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,040
Only hope my humble Qin playing

600
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,680
is good enough

601
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,380
to please the nobles in Shendu.

602
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,240
Mr. Bai, you're being too modest.

603
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,160
When you rise to fame in the future,

604
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,020
hope I can ride on your coattails.

605
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,170
So, sir,

606
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,190
please don't forget about my help after you succeed.

607
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,390
Please rest assured.

608
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,280
If I make it one day,

609
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,480
I'll surely repay you for recognizing

610
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,270
my talents.

611
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,810
Since we've come to an agreement,

612
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,720
then I'll head back

613
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,290
to the capital in three days.

614
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,560
I'll be waiting for you

615
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,000
at the city gate, Mr. Bai.

616
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,930
Is that okay?

617
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,920
Three days?

618
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,040
What's wrong?

619
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,410
Mr. Bai,

620
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,460
do you have any family members who need to be settled?

621
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,680
If that's the case,

622
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,830
I can also push it back for a few days

623
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,880
for your sake.

624
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,110
It's okay.

625
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,060
Three days is fine.

626
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,150
Watch where you're going! Are you blind?

627
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,770
I'm sorry.

628
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,440
Is "sorry" all it takes?

629
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,400
The road is super wide,

630
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
yet you still bumped into me?

631
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,280
I'm truly sorry.

632
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,900
Now tell me.

633
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,330
How are you going to compensate me?

634
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,160
You were the one

635
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,940
who wasn't watching where you were going.

636
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,430
How come now

637
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,760
you're blaming others?

638
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,440
Mind your own business.

639
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,110
Thank you, Mr. Bai,

640
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,340
for your help today.

641
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,790
Don't mention it.

642
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,420
You also helped me before.

643
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,720
Forget about it.

644
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,850
I didn't expect

645
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,420
to run into you here today.

646
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,080
Life is full

647
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,420
of surprises.

648
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,720
Indeed,

649
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,890
the surprising and ever-changing life.

650
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,360
That's why

651
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,280
we should seek

652
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,750
divination for guidance

653
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,980
when we're confused.

654
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,270
You just happened to hear

655
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,530
the divination you wanted to hear today.

656
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,160
It's better to rely on yourself than others.

657
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,110
In life,

658
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,960
one must know

659
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,620
what they really want, right?

660
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,160
That's true.

661
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,310
But we should also learn to

662
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,910
be content with what we have.

663
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,320
Today, that old friend of mine

664
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
also told me that

665
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,400
with honesty and sincerity,

666
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
there's nothing you can't get over.

667
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,640
You're right.

668
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,720
No sincerity

669
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,280
is the most terrible thing.

670
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,040
Life is short.

671
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,740
Live it to the fullest;

672
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,570
don't waste your youth.

673
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,410
Alright,

674
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,970
it's time for me to go back.

675
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,760
I'll take my leave.

676
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,130
See you around.

677
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,150
We'll go to Liushui Pavilion

678
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,480
for music if we're free.

679
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,260
Then I'll look forward to your visit.

680
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,470
-Madam.
-Madam.

681
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,570
Be careful.

682
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,150
I stepped on my dress.

683
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,389
Bodhisattva!

684
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,949
The Bodhisattva's manifested!

685
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,800
Madam, you're pregnant

686
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
and can easily get tired.

687
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,360
A long tour is too much for you.

688
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Actually, Madam,

689
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,020
as long as you pray sincerely,

690
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,909
even if you don't come in person,

691
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,630
the gods will still hear you.

692
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,230
Madam, please rest well for the baby's sake.

693
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,090
And you will have a safe delivery.

694
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,980
Thank you, sir.

695
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,870
I've long heard that Fa'en Temple

696
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,670
is bustling with believers and grants all wishes.

697
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,480
So it's you, sir, fulfilling

698
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,140
people's wishes for the gods.

699
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,670
My real name is Chilian.

700
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,010
I was blessed by the Bodhisattva,

701
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,630
luckily obtaining a primordial spirit and consciousness.

702
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,810
Since I took human form,

703
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,110
I've naturally stayed here

704
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,040
to serve the gods

705
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,690
and repay their kindness.

706
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
How dare you,

707
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,840
a mere demon, act on behalf of the gods?

708
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,590
Mortals with good intentions can also accumulate virtue and do good deeds.

709
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,650
Though I am a demon,

710
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,320
I dare say my abilities surpass those of ordinary humans.

711
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,250
I have intentions to do good, to save and help people.

712
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,720
What's wrong with that?

713
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,030
Yeah,

714
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,630
if one's sincerely

715
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,830
trying to help people

716
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,370
and accumulate virtue,

717
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,320
then even a demon

718
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,980
can do good deeds for the gods.

719
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,680
But what if

720
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,440
it's someone whose hands are stained with blood?

721
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,900
Zhang Pu and Lv Sanlang

722
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,050
were both killed by you, weren't they?

723
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,470
Guanyin Bodhisattva is merciful,

724
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,640
shedding tears of compassion for people.

725
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,280
Her followers are spread across the land.

726
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,880
Xingxian is one of them.

727
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,030
I heard about

728
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,430
Xingxian's tragic life.

729
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,920
Without anyone to rely on,

730
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,020
she could only turn to the gods

731
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,680
telling them her grievances.

732
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,760
And you

733
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,460
heard her prayer

734
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,230
right here,

735
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,500
didn't you?

736
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,080
I was simply fulfilling wishes on behalf of the gods.

737
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,560
Numerous people

738
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,340
have come to Fa'en Temple to pray.

739
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,510
Only those with good intentions

740
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,310
have had their wishes come true,

741
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,520
not the ones with evil intentions.

742
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
I just want to know

743
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,490
why you made an exception

744
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,610
for Xingxian only.

745
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,400
I don't care about

746
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,530
your relationship.

747
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,840
But it's never right to kill people.

748
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,110
You've crossed the line.

749
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,440
There are no boundaries between good and evil in this world.

750
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,060
So there should be no such thing as "crossing the line."

751
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,710
You humans often say, "What goes around comes around."

752
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,550
That Zhang Pu

753
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,590
was addicted to alcohol and beating his wife.

754
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,590
Wasn't that evil?

755
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,150
Lv Sanlang was greedy and lecherous,

756
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,110
abusing women.

757
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,800
Wasn't that evil too?

758
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,010
That being the case,

759
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,180
what's wrong with me punishing those scoundrels?

760
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,880
Punishing evil and doing good is not wrong in itself.

761
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
The real problem

762
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,510
is your way of fighting evil with more evil.

763
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,640
In the mortal world,

764
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,230
there are rules and laws.

765
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,070
To punish those evil guys,

766
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,000
you used sorcery

767
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,620
and committed murder.

768
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,380
I'm a demon hunter.

769
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,350
I only know one thing—

770
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,880
once a demon kills a human,

771
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,490
it cannot be forgiven.

772
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,110
You do it once,

773
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,690
and you can't hold back.

774
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,840
It'll happen again,

775
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,630
maybe tens of thousands of times.

776
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,440
Now you've made an exception and killed them for Xingxian.

777
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,640
What about next time?

778
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,230
If Xingxian has

779
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,030
other wishes,

780
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,480
what will you do?

781
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,130
How far will you go for her?

782
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,480
I know

783
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,010
snake slough can reshape bones

784
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,790
and change one's appearance.

785
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,190
The substitute you've been hiding

786
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,000
at home

787
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,820
is Xingxian, right?

788
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,660
She's innocent. Don't you dare hurt her.

789
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,550
Considering the good deeds you did

790
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,880
and the lives you saved,

791
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,380
I won't do anything

792
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,560
to both of you.

793
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,510
But there's one condition.

794
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,730
I want you to leave Guangping,

795
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,920
never coming back,

796
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,440
and swear that

797
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,960
you will never kill

798
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,070
anyone again.

799
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,940
In a few days,

800
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,790
I will be leaving Guangping.

801
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,590
I didn't have time to prepare much today.

802
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,500
So I'll raise this cup of tea instead of wine

803
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,700
as a toast to you, sir.

804
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,370
Thank you for saving me

805
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,280
and giving me a second chance at life.

806
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,340
Were it not for you,

807
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm afraid I would still

808
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,690
be locked up and beaten

809
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,910
by Zhang Pu every day,

810
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,600
with no hope for better days

811
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,150
or a chance to see

812
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,170
such a vast world.

813
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,800
Sir,

814
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,030
thank you so much.

815
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,080
Do you plan to go to Shendu?

816
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,270
Shendu is the capital,

817
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,700
prosperous but extravagant.

818
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,230
Be it food, clothing, or other daily necessities,

819
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,030
everything there is expensive.

820
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,020
I've heard that even paper there

821
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,690
is pricier than elsewhere.

822
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,920
I wanted to go before

823
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,110
because Mr. Gu

824
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,520
said he'd recommend you to His Majesty.

825
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,760
I thought it was

826
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,840
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

827
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,820
But on second thought,

828
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,550
it's really not necessary.

829
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,670
Sir, you are such a pure, kind-hearted person

830
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,750
with virtues and integrity,

831
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,820
like no one else.

832
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,550
You really shouldn't be tainted

833
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,760
by the fame or fortune

834
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,020
of this corrupt world.

835
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,150
Good.

836
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,850
I'm also thinking of visiting Jiangnan.

837
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,160
Perhaps we could travel together.

838
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,710
Didn't you

839
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,690
want to stay in Guangping?

840
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,320
Things can change.

841
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,630
Now, my fate with Guangping

842
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,630
has come to an end.

843
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,800
It's time to leave.

844
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,930
But...

845
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,400
I know your concerns.

846
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,210
But I'm not leaving Guangping

847
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,130
because of you.

848
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,110
There's another reason.

849
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,550
Another

850
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,790
reason?

851
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,160
I've made up my mind.

852
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,520
Instead of being stuck in this tiny corner of the world

853
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,920
and holding myself back,

854
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,480
why not travel around the world

855
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,810
to broaden my horizons?

856
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,550
I happen to know

857
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,780
several Qin masters in Jiangnan.

858
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,800
Perhaps we

859
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,700
could pay them a visit.

860
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,480
If we get tired of our stay in Jiangnan,

861
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,880
we can go to Qingzhou next

862
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,250
to see the floating flowers in March.

863
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,630
Or we could head for the frontier

864
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,840
to see the long, straight smoke in the vast desert.

865
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Anyway,

866
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,740
let's leave this place

867
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,860
to lead a completely different life.

868
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Let more people

869
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,160
hear our Qin music.

870
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,200
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

871
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
What do you think?

872
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,150
It's up to you.

873
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,490
Alright.

874
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,360
Then let's pack up

875
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,670
and set off in two days.
