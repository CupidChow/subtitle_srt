00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,160
Hai

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,820
What's on your mind like that?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,120
I want to write them and send a regards to them.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,400
This is going to turn out really well...

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,560
We're going with other patterns...

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Is that so?

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
Despite my knowledge...

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,740
For a citizens like you...

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,600
I understand I should talk to you more often...

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,400
this is going to be my main concern...

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,080
But...

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,980
This is much like what I always meant..

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

20
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

21
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,980
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:03,980
You're a group of informants.

23
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,980
You've been under the law for ten years.

24
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,980
You're trying to get into the court, but you can't control it.

25
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,980
If you can't control it, then stop controlling it.

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,980
I'll follow your bloodline as you wish.

27
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
You're so strong.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,980
This world should be your hunting ground.

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
It's you?

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,980
How is it?

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,980
Do you know your identity now?

32
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

33
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,980
I'm just telling you the truth.

34
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,980
You don't hate the people who hide you, but you hate me.

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,980
It's not good.

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,980
I don't need you to control it.

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,980
You're my brother. Of course I can control you.

38
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,980
I won't leave with you.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Don't make a fool of yourself.

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,980
I'll kill you if you don't come back.

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
Qi Yi.

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,980
You're capable of killing me?

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,980
You'd rather die than take the medicine.

44
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
What did they do to you?

45
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
You're so cruel.

46
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
I'll ask you one more time.

47
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,980
What do you think you're doing?

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,980
I'll ask you one more time.

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
Are you going to leave with me?

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Have a rest.

51
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,980
Okay.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,980
You're so cruel.

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
You've been trying to kill me.

54
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,980
I'll let you see if you're exposed.

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,980
And if someone wants to take you.

56
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,980
Qi Yi.

57
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,980
Qi Yi.

58
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,980
Are you okay?

59
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,980
Qi Yi.

60
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Father. Mother.

61
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
Brother.

62
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm here to see you again.

63
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,980
Every time I come back,

64
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,980
I'll come back to see you.

65
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,980
I'll clean your room.

66
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
I also told you

67
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,980
that I've been through some things when I took the medicine.

68
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,980
It seems that you're like being by my side.

69
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Father.

70
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,980
I've been confused.

71
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Why?

72
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,980
I don't remember what happened 12 years ago.

73
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Why did you send me back to Gu'erhuan?

74
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Why didn't you let me go to the underground city?

75
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Why did you all take the medicine?

76
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,980
I'm the only one who's fine.

77
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,980
Now, I understand.

78
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Actually, all this is very simple.

79
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Because I'm a demon.

80
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
A demon.

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,980
In the end, I became the main demon.

82
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm really a fan.

83
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
Father.

84
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,980
You told me before.

85
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
People are kind.

86
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,980
A demon is good and bad.

87
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,980
It can't be changed.

88
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Only I can decide who I am.

89
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,980
But now, who am I?

90
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
Father.

91
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Do you know?

92
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
I'm leaving.

93
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
I won't come back.

94
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Father.

95
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Father.

96
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
How is it?

97
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,980
It's okay.

98
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
It's okay.

99
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,980
Come on.

100
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Let's start.

101
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Give it to me.

102
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Give it to me.

103
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Give it to me.

104
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Xuan Yi, we'll go back to Guangping.

105
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
I don't know.

106
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
Where are we going?

107
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
I don't know.

108
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,980
Are we going to change the pharmacy?

109
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Xuan Yi, if you don't go out,

110
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
why don't you follow me?

111
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
You taught me to be a good person.

112
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Now, I should teach you to be a demon.

113
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Don't worry. I can teach you.

114
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,980
If you want to, you can be my half-dead demon.

115
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
I can be your half-dead demon.

116
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
I don't care about it.

117
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Xuan Yi.

118
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Don't follow me.

119
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Why?

120
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,980
I'm so confused and unable to control myself.

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

122
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
It's okay. I ran so fast.

123
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I'll run when you change.

124
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
I'll come back when you become human.

125
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
I promise you won't catch me.

126
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Xuan Yi, don't be unhappy.

127
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,980
It's not bad to be a demon.

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,980
Didn't your father say that

129
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
human and demon are the same?

130
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,980
If you're a demon, you'll be fine.

131
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,980
I'm a demon.

132
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,980
You're not afraid that I'll eat you?

133
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
You're Xuan Yi.

134
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Xuan Yi never eats rabbits.

135
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Hurry up. Don't let that demon run away.

136
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
He's over there. Hurry up.

137
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Hurry up.

138
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
He's over there. Hurry up.

139
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Hurry up.

140
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
They said they'll take revenge.

141
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Shall we go and see?

142
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,980
We've searched the whole city.

143
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Xuan Yi didn't even have a shadow.

144
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
He's gone with his parents.

145
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
He must be angry.

146
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,980
He's not even going to say hello to us.

147
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Wen Ji, who's that second brother?

148
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,980
It must be the master's assistant.

149
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Assistant?

150
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Xuan Yi isn't gone.

151
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
Why did he find another assistant?

152
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Xuan Yi is going to be married a while ago.

153
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Do you think he'll act like you?

154
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
It's not good.

155
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,980
It's not good.

156
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
It's not good. It's not good.

157
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
The demon... the demon appeared again.

158
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
The demon is very heavy.

159
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,980
It must be in this mountain.

160
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
I can smell it.

161
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Where is it?

162
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
In your body.

163
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Find it separately.

164
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
Zhi Quan.

165
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

166
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,980
I got it.

167
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Mother!

168
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Don't go home!

169
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Mother! I want to go home!

170
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
Mother!

171
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
Mother!

172
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
Mother!

173
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Mother!

174
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,980
I want to go home!

175
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Mother!

176
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,980
I want to go home!

177
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,980
Mother!

178
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Mother!

179
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
I want to go home!

180
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,980
I want to go home!

181
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Mother!

182
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
You're here fast enough.

183
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
You...

184
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,980
Call yourself.

185
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Mother!

186
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,980
Mother!

187
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980
Mother!

188
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,980
Mother!

189
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
Mother!

190
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Mother!

191
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Mother!

192
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Mother!

193
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Mother!

194
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Mother!

195
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Mother!

196
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,980
Mother!

197
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,980
Mother!

198
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
Mother!

199
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Mother!

200
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
Mother!

201
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Mother!

202
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
You're so fierce.

203
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
That's good.

204
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
Since you love playing, I'll play with you.

205
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Jiu Lin Formation.

206
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Blood-drenched.

207
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
Blood-drenched.

208
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
How is it?

209
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
Is it fun?

210
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
This is the new blood of the father.

211
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
I didn't expect this to be the first time...

212
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
but it's in your hands.

213
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
How is it?

214
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Compared to the number of people in your family?

215
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Who's taller? Who's shorter?

216
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Brother!

217
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
I've sealed your disguise.

218
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,980
In a short period of time, you'll never change your personality.

219
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Man Ying, don't hate me.

220
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
I've already decided...

221
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
what I want to teach you.

222
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,980
What is the human demon's way of doing things?

223
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
There's not much time.

224
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Let's go to the wrong place.

225
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
Canshe!

226
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
How dare you!

227
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
You're so bold and bold.

228
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
How dare you hurt people in the capital!

229
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
Kill them!

230
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Kill them!

231
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Hey!

232
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
What?

233
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Demon!

234
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
It's a 58!

235
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Xu Yuan!

236
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
How is it?

237
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Am I good?

238
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Let's go. I'll protect you.

239
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Let's go!

240
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Let's go!

241
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Let's go.

242
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,980
Let's go.

243
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Let's go.

244
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Let's go!

245
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
We're not round anymore.

246
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Is everyone here?

247
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
All of you come in?

248
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
After us!

249
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,500
адцies

250
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,580
Go

251
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,580
Miss

252
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,660
Miss

253
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Pantheon

254
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,500
Pantheon

255
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,060
Miss

256
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,540
Pantheon

257
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,460
Pantheon

258
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,540
Pantheon

259
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,820
Where is Pantheon?

260
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,860
Did you have a dream?

261
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,060
Banxia.

262
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,460
Where are you?

263
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
We're on our way back to Nanyang.

264
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,500
Banxia, last night,

265
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,820
you were so hot and cold.

266
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,820
Your father was afraid that you wouldn't leave

267
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,860
after you woke up.

268
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,540
So he made a big breakfast.

269
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,780
We're going back to our hometown.

270
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,740
Mom.

271
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,060
I can't leave.

272
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,060
Mom, I can't leave.

273
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,900
I know.

274
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,700
I know that I'm not young anymore.

275
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,620
I need to go back to my parents.

276
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,140
I should go back.

277
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,820
But Xuanxuan is in danger now.

278
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,220
I can't leave her alone.

279
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,020
I can't leave her alone.

280
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,140
Banxia.

281
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,420
But what can you do now?

282
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,180
I can accompany her.

283
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,940
I can change my mind.

284
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,940
If she's in danger,

285
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,140
I can save her.

286
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,900
Mom.

287
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,140
You've been locked up before.

288
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,820
You've been held hostage.

289
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,980
You know that

290
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,820
you don't want to be abandoned.

291
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,420
You don't want to be abandoned, right?

292
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,140
Mom, I can't leave you alone.

293
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,740
Mom.

294
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,660
It's good to get this fruit.

295
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,060
So I'll give it to Banxia.

296
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,020
Mom.

297
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,300
Give me.

298
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,220
Go.

299
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,940
Go.

300
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,340
Lin Zhou.

301
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,860
Have you waked Young Missně?

302
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,380
Not yet.

303
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,820
Banxia.

304
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,220
I have been missing you for five years.

305
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Don't say that I'm hiding.

306
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Where did Miss go?

307
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:03,220
I used to be beautiful, but now I'm not.

308
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,220
In the fate, I have to break through.

309
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,220
I've been through so many hardships.

310
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:20,220
I've been missing you for so many years.

311
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Lord Geng.

312
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
Master.

313
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,220
What can I do for you?

314
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
It's a black demon.

315
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,220
It's hard to kill two people with my head.

316
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,220
But I've told the teachers to take care of my master.

317
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
That's great.

318
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,220
I'll leave it to you.

319
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,220
Don't let the demon monster get hurt.

320
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Don't worry, Lord Geng.

321
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,220
We're here. He won't do it.

322
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
You Lang.

323
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Master.

324
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
The demon is fierce.

325
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,220
I've given the letter to the minister.

326
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,220
We'll hand it over to him when we get the reward.

327
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
It's none of our business.

328
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Master.

329
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Did we meet the demon monster?

330
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
What do you mean?

331
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
I think so.

332
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,220
You think so?

333
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
You don't have enough cultivation.

334
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
Don't think too much.

335
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Practice hard.

336
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
What are you doing?

337
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,220
The minister said that the demon monster is responsible for the food.

338
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
No one will take it away from them.

339
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
It's not their fault.

340
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
The blood won't die.

341
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Blood is a medicine.

342
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
You want to make a revolution for the demon in the Yaon Sect?

343
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
No.

344
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
I don't want to.

345
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
I don't want to.

346
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
I don't want to.

347
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
You want to make a revolution for the demon in the Yaon Sect?

348
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
Even if the demon is a revolution,

349
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
it can only be done in a few days.

350
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,220
And I always think

351
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
this is not right.

352
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,220
Why didn't blood die?

353
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Because of the demon.

354
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Stop dreaming.

355
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
What are you doing?

356
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
The demon is in here.

357
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
You are too bold to protect it.

358
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
Demon?

359
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
What's wrong with the demon?

360
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
He ate my child and killed him.

361
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
I want him to die.

362
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
Yes, the demon will stay.

363
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
The demon will stay.

364
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Everyone, listen to me.

365
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
The demon monster is indeed a murderer.

366
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
The responsibility of our Chinese medicine world

367
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
is to produce the evil evil.

368
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Protect the people.

369
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
But this demon is cruel.

370
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
It can't be used in the search for a means.

371
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
You can't kill him.

372
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
So,

373
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
we must bring him back to the temple

374
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
to deal with my master.

375
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
Uncle Wu, how can we not kill him?

376
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Who is that demon?

377
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Just a scumbag today.

378
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
He could have been killed.

379
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
Uncle Wu, don't go with him.

380
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,220
Uncle Wu, don't go with him.

381
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
What's wrong with you?

382
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
Uncle Wu, don't go with him.

383
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
What's wrong with you?

384
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Uncle Wu, don't go with him.

385
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Uncle Wu.

386
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
He could have been killed.

387
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
He killed 643.

388
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
643 is his only son.

389
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
And he is the son of the demon.

390
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
I don't blame him.

391
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
I'll kill him!

392
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
I'll kill him!

393
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Kill him!

394
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,220
Kill him!

395
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Kill him!

396
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
It's him!

397
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
The Xia Ji Sect is the one who killed my child!

398
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
I'll kill him!

399
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Kill him!

400
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Kill him!

401
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Stop!

402
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Who's the teacher?

403
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
Get off the stage!

404
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,220
Who put the people down?

405
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,220
Ask your own people why they didn't stop the people

406
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
and let them get in.

407
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Why did you put down the black cloth?

408
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
The people are already too far away.

409
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Let everyone find out.

410
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Who gave you the right?

411
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Master Geng has already left.

412
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
He has to be managed by me.

413
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Let me see the master.

414
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,220
Wandao.

415
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Bai Xia.

416
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
Did Xuan Yi and Chi Xuan have any news?

417
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
I just went to Gan Shan Hall.

418
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
The door is still closed.

419
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
Did they come back?

420
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
I...

421
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Did something happen?

422
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
Yin Cao has a bad omen.

423
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
A child has been lost outside the school.

424
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,220
The master asked for two important things.

425
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
He didn't know why Chi Xuan

426
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,220
protected the black cloth.

427
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
He...

428
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,220
He...

429
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,220
Chi Xuan is dead?

430
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
I don't know where Xuan Yi is.

431
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
I think he is not dead.

432
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Where is the demon?

433
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
Where is the demon?

434
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
The two keys are locked.

435
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
They are locked in the yard.

436
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
Little monster!

437
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
What are you doing?

438
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
I'm going to kill you.

439
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Little monster!

440
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Kill him!

441
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Kill him!

442
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
Kill him!

443
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
Kill him!

444
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Kill him!

445
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Kill him!

446
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
Kill him!

447
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
Kill him!

448
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,220
He is a demon!

449
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,220
I'll kill him!

450
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Father!

451
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
I'm sorry.

452
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
I didn't tell you.

454
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,220
How can I help you get out of Xuan Yi?

455
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
Tell me!

456
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,220
How can I help you get out of Xuan Yi?

457
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Kill him!

458
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
Kill him!

459
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
Kill him!

460
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Kill him!

461
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Kill him!

462
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Kill him!

463
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Run!

464
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Kill him!

465
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Kill him!

466
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Kill him!

467
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Kill him!

468
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Kill him!

469
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Man Shang!

470
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Man Shang!

471
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Man Shang!

472
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Man Shang!

473
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Man Shang!

474
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Man Shang!

475
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Man Shang!

476
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Help!

477
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Help!

478
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Help!

479
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Help!

480
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
There's no one here.

481
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Xueyan, you...

482
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Are you okay?

483
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Don't be mad at me.

484
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,220
If you're mad at me, I'll get you out of here.

485
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,220
I've been looking for you for so long.

486
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
I've been thinking about it for so long.

487
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
How could I get you out of here in a second?

488
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Leave! Don't care about me!

489
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
What's your name?

490
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm Ma You!

491
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
Leave!

492
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,220
I remember telling you that

493
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,220
when I was young, I was in danger.

494
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,220
A young man named Man Ying saved me.

495
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,220
In order to save me from the wound,

496
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Xueyan believed in me.

497
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,220
I can't see the demon anymore.

498
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,220
They told me that was a dream.

499
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,220
But I didn't know it.

500
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,220
I don't know why.

501
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,220
I can't find that place anymore.

502
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
I can't find Man Ying anymore.

503
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,220
I thought this was the end.

504
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,220
But if it's a dream,

505
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
I'll wake up.

506
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,220
I've been in a dream and I've become crazy.

507
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
Xueyan.

508
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
We met again.

509
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
But you don't remember that you're Man Ying.

510
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
You don't remember me anymore.

511
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
But I didn't forget.

512
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,220
I can't see the demon anymore.

513
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,220
I can't find the demon anymore.

514
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
What's wrong with you?

515
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,220
Xueyan!

516
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
Stop it.

517
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Do it!

518
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,220
You guys are wrong!

519
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,220
The murderer is not him!

520
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Bai Shang! I'm here! Come here!

521
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Don't hurt him! He's Xueyan!

522
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Catch the demon!

523
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Stop it!

524
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
Stop it!

525
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Xueyan, I'm fine. It's okay.

526
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Miss Dong.

527
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Who's there?

528
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
Xueyan.

529
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Xueyan.

530
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
Master, he...

531
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
He's back!

532
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
He's back!

533
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
He's back!

534
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
He's not hurt!

535
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
It's okay.

536
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
It's okay.

537
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
He's fine.

538
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
It's okay.

539
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
It's okay.

540
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
He's fine.

541
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
It's okay.

542
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
It's okay.

543
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
It's okay.

544
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Why did you catch the demon?

545
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
He's not a demon.

546
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Yes, Master.

547
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
Let me ask you.

548
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,220
The two immortals said that Xuanye is the demon.

549
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Is it true or not?

550
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
Master.

551
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
It's just their words.

552
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Where's Xuanye now?

553
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,220
She's not here often.

554
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
Maybe she's caught the demon.

555
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Then that rabbit demon is her father.

556
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,220
It seems that the case six years ago

557
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,220
should be related to her.

558
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
This case is a serious matter.

559
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Before the investigation is done,

560
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
you are not allowed to leave the office.

561
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,220
Master.

562
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
You may leave.

563
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,220
I won't letcle happens.

564
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,220
I'm not here again, Miss.

565
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
It's a demon.

566
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,580
Even if you don't tell me,

567
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,820
I can catch it.

568
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,140
Someone saw the demon

569
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,980
and took the child away?

570
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,940
Yes, they saw it.

571
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,300
Impossible.

572
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,340
Xuan won't hurt anyone.

573
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,100
The children must have another demon.

574
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,980
You've got the wrong man.

575
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
Lawyer Liang, and the child is put back.

576
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,860
I was hurt by the patient.

577
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,540
The adults didn't let us go.

578
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,740
Can he hold on to it even if he's in jail?

579
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,540
He's been suffering for half a year.

580
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,340
But I didn't expect

581
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,940
that Xuan Ye was really a drug.

582
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,340
I've known Xuan Ye for so many years.

583
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,540
I saw him taking so many pills.

584
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,540
I didn't expect

585
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,940
that he would be so persistent and protect him.

586
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,940
It seems that I know Xuan Ye's identity.

587
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,140
Then how did you know?

588
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,940
Didn't the kid who was arrested come back?

589
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,940
It means that he's not Xuan Ye.

590
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,340
But you have to know that

591
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,940
in the eyes of the world,

592
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,940
Xuan Ye is always a drug.

593
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,740
How is the drug and how is the person?

594
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
If it's not a criminal, people will be hungry.

595
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
They shouldn't be arrested.

596
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,940
Why are you here?

597
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,340
To help.

598
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,740
Help?

599
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,140
No need.

600
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,340
Need?

601
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,540
Come earlier than to beg.

602
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,340
What should we do?

603
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,340
Help.

604
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,540
I'm a private investigator in the police.

605
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
I have the authority to investigate and review the case.

606
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,340
I think your case is unclear.

607
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,940
So I have to review the case

608
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,940
and investigate it.

609
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,140
You're in charge of the case.

610
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,140
How can you review it?

611
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,940
Secretly review it.

612
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
How can you tell me the secret?

613
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,740
It's to bring the person out quietly.

614
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,940
Then you have to meet someone else to stop him.

615
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,540
Dain.

616
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,740
Isn't that a prison sentence?

617
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,140
No, it's a prison sentence.

618
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,740
I'm a fireman.

619
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,540
Then,

620
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,140
can you not hit me?

621
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,940
Okay.

622
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
You can do it.

623
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,340
Xuan Ye.

624
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,340
It's me.

625
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,140
Xuan...

626
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,340
Xuan Ye.

627
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,140
You're awake.

628
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,940
You're awake?

629
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,340
Yes.

630
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,740
I'm looking for Xuan Ye.

631
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,940
We have to go to the underground small town.

632
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,740
Look for Xuan Ye.

633
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,140
I know.

634
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,940
But you're badly hurt now.

635
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,140
Come.

636
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,340
Xuan Ye.

637
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,940
Xuan Zhong.

638
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,940
Come.

639
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Take a rest.

640
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,540
We'll go tomorrow.

641
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,740
Uncle.

642
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,140
Xuan Ye.

643
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,540
You're awake.

644
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,940
How long have I slept?

645
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,740
You slept for three days.

646
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
Three days?

647
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,940
Drink some water.

648
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,140
Ban Xiang.

649
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,540
Don't worry.

650
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,340
My man is back.

651
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,740
Miss Duan has been saved by your friend.

652
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,340
Saved?

653
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,340
Yes.

654
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,340
Drink some water.

655
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,940
I've been busy with you lately.

656
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
I didn't care about him.

657
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,340
Don't worry.

658
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,740
I've sent someone to look for him.

659
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,740
Thank you, uncle.

660
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,740
I've been in a situation

661
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,940
in Liu Xingguan's capital recently.

662
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
I heard that you had an accident.

663
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,740
I was immediately driven away.

664
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,340
But I didn't expect that you'd still be late.

665
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,740
Xuan Ye.

666
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,940
Your Bu Erhuang

667
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,140
was broken by the Demon of the World in the painting world.

668
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,540
Because there's no Bu Erhuang,

669
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,540
you'll be in danger.

670
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,740
You knew my identity long ago.

671
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,740
Yes.

672
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
But Bu Erhuang is a very difficult person.

673
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,140
Only your father knows about this.

674
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,740
So I...

675
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,540
It's just a famous paper.

676
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,540
I don't want to be second.

677
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,540
What?

678
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,740
Are you blaming your father?

679
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,540
Xuan Ye.

680
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,740
It's not what you think.

681
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
Your father has been protecting you since the beginning.

682
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,740
I'm sorry.

684
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,740
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,740
I'm sorry.

686
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,740
I'm sorry.

687
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,740
I'm sorry.

688
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,740
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,740
I'm sorry.

690
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,740
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,740
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,740
I'm sorry.

694
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,740
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,740
I'm sorry.

696
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,740
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,740
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,740
I'm sorry.

699
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,740
I'm sorry.
