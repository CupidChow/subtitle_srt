I'm going to be a little bit of a

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,420
Two bowls of hot noodles.

57
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,420
That guy is really something.

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,420
He ate for a whole afternoon.

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,420
How long has he been hungry?

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Have a good meal.

61
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Okay, thank you.

62
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,420
He just looks at people eating.

63
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
He's right.

64
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,420
The rain seems to be stopping.

65
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
The water seems to be boiling.

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Have a taste.

67
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,420
The noodles are fine.

68
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,420
Please.

69
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
Three..

70
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,420
Two..

71
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Go inside.

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,420
Three..

73
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Two..

74
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Three!

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Three!

76
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,420
Three!

77
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,420
Four!

78
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Four!

79
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:42,740
Democracy

80
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,620
Dan er!

81
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,260
Dan er!

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,040
Dan er!

83
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Ah!

84
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Ah!

85
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
Brother, you're so good!

86
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,420
Ah!

87
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
Yin Man.

88
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Someone's dead! Someone's dead!

89
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
Oh no, we're trapped.

90
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Why is this person in here? Who is this?

92
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Who is this?

93
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Who is this?

94
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Guangcheng! Guangcheng is here!

95
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
Sir, it's that foreign thief again.

96
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Did you see that thief's face?

97
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
No, we didn't see him.

98
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,420
Please take a handkerchief.

99
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
You two come here.

100
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
Put your boxes in the old man's room.

101
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Yes.

102
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Hurry.

103
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Are you all doing well in Yuenzhou?

104
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Very well.

105
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
I just miss my grandmother.

106
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
I miss you too.

107
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,420
I always hope that you can come back as soon as possible.

108
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Yes.

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,420
Banxia, are you feeling better?

110
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
Much better.

111
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Then, can you still see those weird things?

112
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,420
I can't see them after I take my medicine.

113
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
That's good.

114
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,420
It means that the doctor is capable.

115
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,420
The medicine he prescribed is also useful.

116
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,420
You must take your medicine carefully.

117
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Don't let your father worry about you.

118
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
Grandma is right.

119
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
I remember it in my heart.

120
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
Where is Yanqiu?

121
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Why don't you see Yanqiu?

122
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,420
He is busy with the government affairs.

123
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
He was called up early in the morning.

124
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,420
But he knows that you will come back early today.

125
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,420
He is still in a hurry to get married.

126
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,420
He doesn't want to take a leave.

127
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,420
There are a few more cases in the city.

128
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
A criminal who killed people

129
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
has been running from Guangping to Nanyang.

130
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
It's very chaotic.

131
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,420
The superior urged him to find a solution.

132
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
How can he get married?

133
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Yanqiu's marriage is so urgent.

134
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,420
I didn't know you had a family.

135
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
Who is the other person?

136
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,420
Yanqiu is loyal to himself.

137
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Uncle Yanqiu is back so soon.

138
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
I'll pick you up at the city gate.

139
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
I'm going to take a break.

140
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Yanqiu is back.

141
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Grandma.

142
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Uncle Yanqiu.

143
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,420
It won't be a problem for you to come back at this time.

144
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
I won't bother you with work.

145
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Don't worry, uncle.

146
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,420
I've taken care of everything.

147
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Okay.

148
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm glad to see you.

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Last time, you said that your condition has improved a lot.

150
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Yes.

151
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Thanks to you, the medicine prescribed by the doctor is very effective.

152
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
I just need to take it a few times.

153
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
That's good.

154
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
There is no such thing as a monster in this world.

155
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
Don't think too much in the future.

156
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,420
You'll get better if you have a disease.

157
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
You're right.

158
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Miss.

159
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
What are you doing?

160
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,420
I'm making a new one for my brother's pouch.

161
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Miss.

162
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,420
You're still satisfied with the embroidery work you made for your brother?

163
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Yes.

164
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
Miss.

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,420
I just heard a secret.

166
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Do you want to know?

167
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,420
If I don't let you tell me, I'm afraid I'll suffocate.

168
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Tell me.

169
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,420
I heard from the kitchen that the master didn't agree to the marriage of the young master.

170
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,420
It was the master's big fight that scared the old lady.

171
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,420
That's why he got angry.

172
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Miss.

173
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Why is the young master so bold?

174
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,420
He can marry anyone he wants.

175
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,420
But he chose a girl.

176
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Miss, you said a girl married into our family.

177
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,420
Isn't that a great opportunity?

178
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
Is it a great opportunity?

179
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Miss.

180
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
What's wrong, Miss?

181
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Miss.

182
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
Did you see something again?

183
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Miss.

184
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Mingliang.

185
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
Don't meddle in other people's business.

186
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
I know.

187
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Boss.

188
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Two cups of tea.

189
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Okay.

190
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Come on.

191
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Come on.

192
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Come on.

193
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
How is it?

194
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Did you find anything?

195
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I found it.

196
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
It's in Nanyang.

197
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,420
It's a family of a man named Duan from the west of Yongning.

198
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
It's very rich. You can find it there.

199
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Okay. I'll go there first.

200
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
You take care of the tail.

201
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Tail?

202
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
You're following me again?

203
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I'll follow you until my soul is gone.

204
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
It's raining.

205
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
Miss, hurry up.

206
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
I'll go get the umbrella.

207
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Okay.

208
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Dad.

209
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
You're back.

210
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Dad.

211
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm going back to my room.

212
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Where did you go just now?

213
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
I did some chores.

214
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,420
You've been out early and came back late.

215
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Is there anything wrong?

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
Nothing wrong.

217
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,420
We haven't been back for a long time.

218
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Many people and things need to be done.

219
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Grandma just asked about my marriage.

220
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Banxia.

221
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
I know you're not satisfied with this marriage.

222
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,420
But girls grow up and always want to get married.

223
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
I know Li Xiang's child.

224
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
He's a gentle and kind person.

225
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
He deserves to be taken care of.

226
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,420
You'll be fine after you marry.

227
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,420
I'll come back to help you with this.

228
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Banxia.

229
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,420
We've been living together for years.

230
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
In the future, we'll be your family.

231
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
Your brother is a official.

232
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,420
No one can bully you.

233
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Dad.

234
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
I made a new bag for you.

235
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,420
I think it's really nice to be in the embroidery workshop.

236
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
What's nice?

237
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,440
Even the

238
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I don't know.

239
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
What are you doing?

240
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I heard you said you'd buy a new one.

241
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
That's different.

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Great!

243
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,360
First, my dream is to carry the

244
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,320
Second, funerals

245
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,660
Third, celebrations

246
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,440
I hope to see this contract

247
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,840
These wanwei are from my home

248
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,820
and this characteristic

249
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
One bow.

250
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Two bows.

251
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Three bows.

252
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Miss, hurry up!

253
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
You'll be late and you won't see your bride.

254
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
I told you that Master passed by already.

255
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
You don't believe me?

256
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
You're really walking so fast.

257
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Hurry!

258
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Hurry!

259
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Hurry!

260
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Hurry!

261
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Congratulations!

262
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Congratulations!

263
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Congratulations!

264
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Congratulations!

265
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Congratulations!

266
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Congratulations!

267
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
How many days has it been?

268
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Come and have a few more drinks.

269
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
I have a big day.

270
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Come, come, come, come.

271
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
This way, this way.

272
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
This way.

273
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
How many days has it been?

274
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
How many days has it been?

275
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
What's wrong?

276
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Miss.

277
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Ding Zhuang.

278
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Do you think

279
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
that new sister-in-law

280
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
is a little...

281
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
What?

282
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Is she...

283
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Miss.

284
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Did you see something again?

285
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
What?

286
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
What?

287
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Did you see something again?

288
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Did you fall sick again?

289
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Yes, yes, yes.

290
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Yes.

291
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
I didn't see anything.

292
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
I didn't see anything.

293
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
You scared me.

294
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
I thought you fell sick again.

295
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
The first hour is coming.

296
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Please get ready to leave.

297
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Miss.

298
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
The front yard seems to be open.

299
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Let's go to the wedding.

300
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
You go first.

301
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
What about you?

302
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
I'll wait for my father.

303
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
When he comes, we'll go together.

304
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Okay.

305
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Go.

306
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
It's not you.

307
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
You still owe me a lot.

308
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
This way, right?

309
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
This way.

310
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
This way.

311
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
This way.

312
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Miss.

313
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm coming.

314
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Brother Duan.

315
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Hurry up.

316
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Brother Duan.

317
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
A moment of spring is worth a thousand jin.

318
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Brother Duan.

319
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
We are all together.

320
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
What's the matter?

321
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Go to the wedding.

322
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Go.

323
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Hurry up.

324
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Master.

325
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Master.

327
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Where did you come from?

328
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
You came to my room at midnight?

329
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Madam.

330
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
You have a fight again?

331
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
He is so bold.

333
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Miss.

334
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Let's run.

335
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Where do you want to run?

336
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
There is no door or window here.

337
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
I really have no place to run.

338
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
But, master.

339
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
I have already married someone.

340
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Can you think about it first?

341
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Let me go.

342
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
I can't let you go.

343
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
I see you like it very much.

344
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
How about

345
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
you discuss with your fiancee

346
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
and return to this marriage.

347
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Will you transfer to me?

348
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
My husband

349
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
is good at martial arts.

350
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
He is a good fighter.

351
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Aren't you afraid that he will find out

352
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
and marry you?

353
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
What a coincidence.

354
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
I am also a good fighter.

355
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,820
You can go and tell him.

356
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
If he comes,

357
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
he can fight with me.

358
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
What can I do

359
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
if I fall into your hands?

360
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
I have to go.

361
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
I have to go.

362
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I have to go.

363
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Three.

364
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Three.

365
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
I have to go.

366
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
It's a pity

367
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
that you have such a good voice.

368
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
No one will hear you.

369
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Yes.

370
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Then I can only rely on you.

371
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Three.

372
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
Three.

373
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Be careful.

374
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Are you hurt?

375
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
Who are you?

376
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
The woman you married is a demon.

377
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
I am here to kill demons.

378
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
How dare you!

379
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Hurry up.

380
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
Hurry up.

381
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
Don't move.

382
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Don't move.

383
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
It's her.

384
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
Catch her.

385
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Catch her.

386
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,820
I will not kill demons.

387
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Your family has no future.

388
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,820
Chase her.

389
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Yes.

390
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
I have asked.

391
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
No one knows.

392
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,820
I know.

393
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,820
You can go.

394
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Yes.

395
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
Everyone, leave.

396
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Yes.

397
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
So, you were outside.

398
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
Did you see how the thief came in?

399
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,820
It was dark last night.

400
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
I was just scared.

401
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,820
I didn't see anything.

402
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
Brother.

403
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
That woman said that sister-in-law is a demon.

404
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Nonsense.

405
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,820
That thief is just a person.

406
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Why are you making trouble with her?

407
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Did she forget you took the medicine?

408
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,820
I said it.

409
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
What's going on?

410
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
What's going on?

411
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
What's going on?

412
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
What the hell?

413
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Since you are here,

414
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
you should be more careful.

415
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,820
He is not a demon.

416
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
He is not a demon.

417
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
You are not a demon.

418
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
It's not true.

419
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,820
You are not a demon.

420
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
You are not a demon.

421
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,820
You are not a demon.

422
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,820
You are not a demon.

423
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,620
You didn't sleep well last night.

424
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Go back and rest.

425
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,380
Okay.

426
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,500
Wait.

427
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,020
You didn't attend the banquet last night.

428
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,860
Why did you come to my house?

429
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,980
I was late for the ceremony.

430
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,940
I didn't see my sister-in-law.

431
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,300
So I wanted to see her.

432
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,300
Your sister-in-law was scared last night.

433
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,820
Don't disturb her.

434
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,700
You'll see her more often.

435
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,820
Okay.

436
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,260
Wenyaoyu's temperament is gentle and easy to see.

437
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,340
But she's low in spiritual power.

438
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,660
To survive, she always hides herself.

439
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,100
Ordinary people can't see her.

440
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,820
But you can see her, right?

441
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,540
I can't see her.

442
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,860
I can't see her.

443
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,540
I can't see her.

444
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,060
I can't see her.

445
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,460
I can't see her.

446
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
I can't see her.

447
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,300
Why did you run away?

448
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,500
You can see her.

449
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,620
But you lied to her that you can't see her.

450
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,980
Do you think you can escape by hiding?

451
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,020
That's all a lie.

452
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,020
You know it clearly.

453
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,620
I didn't find my sister here.

454
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,420
Nobody had the word.

455
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,220
She was playingS terrain before.

456
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,920
We took everything into our own hands.

457
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,460
When we arrived, I found her.

458
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,300
She was in her над Morgen's house.

459
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,820
Who told you she was there?

460
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,740
I didn't know what happened.

461
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,380
I went to see her when they were still aware.

462
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,380
I thought it was someone who contained a very important secret evidence,

463
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,380
Okay.

464
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,380
Now you go and find your brother

465
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,980
and tell him the whole story

466
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
and bring him here to see me.

467
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
Oh, right.

468
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,980
If you're free,

469
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,980
can you bring me some food?

470
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Like...

471
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,380
cakes, hot noodles, steamed buns...

472
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380
anything is fine.

473
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Thank you.

474
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Thank you.

475
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Help!

476
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
Help!

477
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Help!

478
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
The thief is here!

479
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,380
Miss, what happened?

480
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,380
The thief was in my room last night.

481
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,380
Hurry up!

482
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
Let's go!

483
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Help!

484
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
How could this happen?

485
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
Where did he go?

486
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Miss Duan,

487
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,380
I'll inform you when Dr. Sun comes back.

488
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,380
There's still some incense left.

489
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,380
When the disease starts,

490
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
you can smell it

491
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,380
and you'll feel better.

492
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
See you.

493
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Thank you.

494
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Good!

495
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Good!

496
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Good!

497
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Good!

498
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
Good!

499
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Don't run away.

500
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
I just want to explain it to you.

501
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
I won't harm you.

502
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Listen to him.

503
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Don't be afraid.

504
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
Why did he run away?

505
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Who told you to come here?

506
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
I'm here to help you.

507
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Miss Duan.

508
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Miss Duan.

509
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,380
What happened to Miss Duan?

510
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
I don't know.

511
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Miss.

512
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Miss.

513
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,380
The young master sent a box of snacks

514
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
from the 6th quality bureau.

515
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
They're still hot.

516
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
What's wrong, Miss?

517
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
You don't look well.

518
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
I'll go get them.

519
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
The young master is so nice to you.

520
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,380
He even remembers your favorite snacks.

521
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
Tingzhe.

522
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
Have you heard

523
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,380
how my brother and my sister-in-law met?

524
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,380
Of course I have.

525
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
I don't even dare to say it.

526
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
I heard from Xiang that

527
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
three months ago,

528
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,380
there was a good-for-nothing soul in the city.

529
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
He's very skilled.

530
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
It's said that

531
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,380
no matter how old a man and a woman are,

532
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,380
they can still be good at it.

533
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,380
He has a pure and sweet voice.

534
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
He's like a real person.

535
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Good!

536
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
Mr. Zhang.

537
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
Mr. Zhang.

538
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,380
Good!

539
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
He's so good!

540
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Listen.

541
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
He's really like a real person.

542
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,380
He's so good!

543
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
He's a good person.

544
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
The young master listened to it.

545
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,380
But he was so wrong.

546
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
Grandpa took you to the market.

547
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,380
Grandpa, I want to buy something fun.

548
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,380
There's everything in the market.

549
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Look for something fun.

550
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
I'll buy it for you.

551
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Good!

552
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,380
He's so good!

553
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,380
Good!

554
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,380
Good!

555
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,380
It's out.

556
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,380
He's so good.

557
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380
He's a real woman.

558
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
He's so good.

559
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,380
He's really good.

560
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,380
He's a real man.

561
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
He's a real man.

562
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,380
He's a real man.

563
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
How could the government agree to this?

564
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,380
He's so good that he can't even eat.

565
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,380
He's not afraid of being laughed at.

566
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
But he didn't listen.

567
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,380
He said he would marry her.

568
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
And then there was a big fight.

569
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
You know what happened later.

570
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
The young master is now a official.

571
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
Grandpa can't control him.

572
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,380
The old lady dotes on him.

573
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
She's the one who has to do everything.

574
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
In the end, she really did it.

575
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,380
I don't know what happened to the thief in the bridal chamber.

576
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Anyway, the young master said

577
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
the bride was frightened.

578
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,380
She can't even get out of the room now.

579
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
She didn't even pay respects to the old lady and the lady.

580
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
The bride was even more frightened.

581
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Do you think everyone would be happy?

582
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,380
Actually, everyone can see that

583
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,380
the bride is not a good person.

584
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,380
But the young master is so determined to protect her.

585
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,380
I don't know what he's up to.

586
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
Please wait a moment, Miss.

587
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,380
I'll be right back.

588
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm here to see you, Miss.

589
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
We're family.

590
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
Don't be so polite.

591
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Are you here to see me?

592
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,380
The thief in the house frightened you.

593
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
I'm here to see you.

594
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
I'm fine.

596
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,380
I'll be fine after a few days.

597
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
Don't stand up.

598
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Sit down and talk.

599
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Sit down and talk.

600
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
I haven't been out for a few days.

601
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,380
I didn't prepare any snacks.

602
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,380
I only have some six-flavor cake.

603
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
I hope you won't mind.

604
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Don't be busy, Miss.

605
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
Have a rest.

606
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,380
I've been having a headache for a few days.

607
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
I couldn't visit my grandmother

608
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,380
as I planned.

609
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
You're not feeling well.

610
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,380
I think your grandmother won't blame you.

611
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
I've been here for a few days

612
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,380
and only you came to visit me.

613
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
I'm different from you.

614
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
I'm not a good wife and husband.

615
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,380
I've been a prostitute since I was a child.

616
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,380
I'm lucky to have met the man of autumn.

617
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
He doesn't think I'm low-born

618
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,380
and he's only interested in marrying me

619
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
for his wife.

620
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
He's not afraid of being ridiculed by my sister.

621
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
I still can't believe

622
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
that it's true.

623
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,380
I don't know where I am

624
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
and what I'm dreaming about.

625
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,380
I know that no one likes me.

626
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,380
They think I've bewitched the man of autumn.

627
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
I won't deny it.

628
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,380
I can't win him over

629
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,380
and I can't win my heart.

630
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,380
I'm greedy

631
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,380
and that's why I'm not in your house.

632
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
But my sister,

633
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
I really like her

634
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
and want to be with her forever.

635
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Do you believe me?

636
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
Yes.

637
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,380
I believe you.

638
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
You're so nice.

639
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,380
In this house,

640
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
you're the best person to me

641
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,380
except for the man of autumn.

642
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
That day in the court,

643
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
I just forgot about you

644
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,380
and thought you were

645
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,380
a person who could speak the truth.

646
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
It's a pity

647
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
that you came back to me

648
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
just to support me.

649
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,380
Otherwise, we could have

650
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,380
a long and happy life.

651
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,380
You look so beautiful.

652
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,380
Your skin is so fair

653
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
and your voice is good.

654
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,380
You've already married someone.

655
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
I wonder who is so lucky.

656
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Suo Suo,

657
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,380
I suddenly feel

658
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,380
a little cold.

659
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
I'm going to rest.

660
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
It's not easy to catch a cold.

661
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,380
Suo Suo, I'm going to rest.

662
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,380
Good!

663
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Good!

664
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
Good!

665
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,380
Good!

666
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,380
Good!

667
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm going to raise a rabbit.

668
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,380
I'm going to raise a rabbit.

669
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,380
I'm going to raise a rabbit.

670
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,380
Are you looking for me?

671
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Who are you?

672
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
Didn't I tell you

673
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
that I'm going to raise a rabbit?

674
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
I'm going to raise a rabbit.

675
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
I'm a demon hunter.

676
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
So, is there really a demon in this world?

677
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Since you came to me,

678
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,380
you must have figured it out.

679
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,380
Demons are the spirits of the heaven and earth.

680
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
They live outside of the fantasy

681
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,380
and live in the virtual world.

682
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
They may be as fragile as a bird

683
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
or as strong as a bird's nest.

684
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
They are all in the vast space of the sky

685
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
and the moon.

686
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,380
They may be as fragile as a stone

687
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,380
and as weak as a moth.

688
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Humans and demons are two worlds.

689
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,380
But they can't coexist with each other.

690
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,380
Some demons are just

691
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,380
trying to get into the human world.

692
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,380
Some demons

693
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
are trying to use their powers

694
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
to harm others.

695
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,380
We're going to get rid of them.

696
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
What about my eyes?

697
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
The demons are most familiar with

698
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
disguise and stealth.

699
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,380
As long as they don't show up willingly,

700
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
the commoners can't see them at all.

701
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,380
You can not only see through their disguise

702
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,380
but also see through their stealth.

703
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,380
This is a talent that is unparalleled.

704
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,380
What? You don't like it?

705
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
A incense?

706
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
It's harmful.

707
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,380
This thing can cover your spiritual sense

708
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,380
and make you unable to see those things.

709
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
But it's bad for your brain if you smell too much.

710
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,380
Is what you just said

711
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,380
all true?

712
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,380
If you don't believe me,

713
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,380
you won't come to me.

714
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
I believe there are demons in this world.

715
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,380
But how can I not believe you?

716
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
I believe there are demons in this world.

717
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,380
But how can I not believe you?

718
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,380
You didn't allow a demon to moisten the earth.

719
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,380
How did you do that?

720
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,380
You didn't allow the demon to moisten the earth.

721
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,380
Which one did you do this to to bear the burden?

722
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
You should not have gone that way.

723
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,380
A demon is not a demon.

724
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,380
I didn't ask for a demon.

725
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,380
Two demons politics forces him in a car.

726
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,380
That is 주оль waits for Mr. True Magic.

727
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,380
You didn't say come in.

728
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Don't touch me.

729
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,380
You came to the wedding of your brother?

730
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,380
What a coincidence.

731
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,380
There's a wedding in this place.

732
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Look, they're here.

733
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,380
Who's here?

734
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
You used the incense.

735
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,380
That thing will only weaken your sense of smell.

736
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,380
It will ruin your wedding.

737
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,380
How about this?

738
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,380
It's a rare opportunity.

739
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,380
I'll use the incense to help you open your eyes again.

740
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
No, I don't think so.

741
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,380
I...

742
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,380
It's a little bit painful.

743
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,380
Bear with it.

744
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
What is this?

745
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Now, look.

746
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Can you see it?

747
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,380
It's okay.

748
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,380
Don't be afraid.

749
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,380
Don't wake the dreamer up

750
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,380
In the mist

751
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,380
Slowly to engrave your face

752
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,380
Come to the windfall of the long night

753
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,380
I can stand in the other side of the road

754
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,380
Waiting for the end of the past to meet you

755
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:02,380
I'll be back to the same name after that long night

756
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,380
I want to fly to the bottom of the earth and sink into the sea

757
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,380
In the mountains and rivers, I can see you

758
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,380
Staying in the dream

759
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,380
Love

760
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,380
If memories will be pushed into the destiny

761
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,380
If dust will rise after falling

762
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,380
In the wind of time

763
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,380
Who is waiting for the wind to rise

764
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,380
Memories are a memory of half a year

765
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,380
A lifetime of real and unbreakable

766
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,380
One day is not shy, one day is not empty

767
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,380
I'm always silent, only to be caught in a dream

768
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,380
I can't wait to be caught in a dream

769
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,380
Like a breeze, blowing through my heart

770
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,380
One night is not shy, one night is not empty

771
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,380
In the wind of time, I can see you

772
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:42,380
Staying in the dream

773
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,380
I'm always silent, only to be caught in a dream
