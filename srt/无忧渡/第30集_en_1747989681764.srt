1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Search for freezer

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,640
We found some tonnage

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,060
Check it

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,500
O fun

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,820
Holy Dosh

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,020
A museum

7
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,020
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,020
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

9
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,020
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

11
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:51,900
Laing

13
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
After eating, let's go get our clothes.

14
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Wait a bit. I need to wait for someone.

15
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
Doctor, you're looking for me?

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,020
Please send this to the city of Shendu, Huaijiang, to the minister of officials.

17
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,020
The city of Shendu, Huaijiang, to the minister of officials.

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,020
Remember, don't worry, I'll take it.

19
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,020
Thank you.

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
Minister of officials?

21
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,020
I went to the city of Shendu, and I bumped into the minister of officials and got caught.

22
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,020
I helped him and got to know him.

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Then what's your letter to him?

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
The letter of the execution.

25
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,020
The letter of the execution was sent to the minister of officials, Li Boshi Lang,

26
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,020
and the letter of the execution is good.

27
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Why did you send the letter of the execution?

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
Why did you send the letter of the execution?

29
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,020
Shouldn't I?

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,020
But I think...

31
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,020
You think I'm a demon, and I might cheat people.

32
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,020
Everyone has to pay for their own actions.

33
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,020
You can't let the good get the evil, and the bad get the good.

34
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
You can't let the evil get the bad, and the evil can't bully the evil.

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,020
You can't let the evil get the evil, and the bad can't bully the evil.

36
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
You're right.

37
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
Let's go.

38
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
Okay.

39
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Shen Ye, did you solve the problem last time?

40
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
What problem?

41
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,020
You suddenly changed.

42
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
You were alone.

43
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,020
And you told me that you would come back to me.

44
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,020
It's solved.

45
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
So, are you a demon?

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
Don't worry.

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,020
I'm not worried.

48
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,020
Why didn't you come to eat good food today?

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
Maybe he's packing up.

50
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Packing up?

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
He's leaving.

52
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
He's leaving?

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
What's wrong?

54
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
Where is he going?

55
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,020
He thinks I'm not good to him, so he's leaving.

56
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Isn't that a joke?

57
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,020
Did you promise him?

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
He's just like that.

59
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,020
Sometimes, he'll go out to play for a while.

60
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Is it dangerous for him to run out like this?

61
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,020
He's a demon, not a child.

62
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Yes.

63
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,020
But what if he meets another demon?

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
The last time, that Jiang's demon

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
almost caught him.

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
You don't want him to leave?

67
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Although we have a demon,

68
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
my dad and I don't have it on Chi Xue.

69
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Chi Xue grew up with my dad.

70
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,020
We all treat him as a family.

71
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,020
So he lost his parents and respected his choice.

72
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
And he's a demon.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
He'll leave me sooner or later.

74
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Why must he leave?

75
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
Why can't he be with another demon?

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
You said it yourself.

77
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
Can you be fair?

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
I mean,

79
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,020
can't you be like Chi Xue's good friend?

80
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,020
There's no need for friends to be with each other.

81
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Everyone has their own path.

82
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,020
We'll be strong together

83
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,020
and bring some strength.

84
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,020
Okay, let's go to the clinic.

85
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
Zhang Gui.

86
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
Miss, you're here.

87
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,020
I'm here to get my clothes.

88
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,020
I said you should get it today.

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
You just finished it last night.

90
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
Go in and try it.

91
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
If there's anything wrong,

92
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
I'll help you change it.

93
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Thank you.

94
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,020
I'll go and try it on.

95
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,020
Wait for me.

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
Okay.

97
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Mister, take a look.

98
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
The cloth in my shop is all new.

99
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
If you like it,

100
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,020
you can wear it.

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
I'll buy it for you.

102
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Stop.

104
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Qing Zhou,

105
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
help me to get the job.

106
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
I'll buy it for you.

107
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
I'll buy it for you.

108
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
Xue Ye.

109
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
Xue Ye.

110
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Xue Ye.

111
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Xue Ye.

112
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Xue Ye.

113
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
Xue Ye.

114
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Xue Ye.

115
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Xue Ye.

116
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Man Xin.

117
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Master, what's wrong?

118
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Why are you so hot? Get up.

119
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
It's a demon.

120
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
A big demon.

121
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Last night, it was a big demon.

122
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,020
He was a very powerful demon.

123
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
He was very powerful.

124
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,020
He was the one who hit me.

125
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Where's Xue Ye?

126
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
I don't know.

127
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
You're awake.

128
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
It's you.

129
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
Do you remember me?

130
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
I was in a hurry.

131
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
I was in a hurry.

132
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
But I remember you.

133
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
You were very lucky.

134
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
You didn't die.

135
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
I really forgot.

136
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
I was in a hurry.

137
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
I was in a hurry.

138
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
I was in a hurry.

139
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
I was in a hurry.

140
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
I was in a hurry.

141
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
It seems that you don't remember me.

142
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
You even forget yourself.

143
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
Xue Ye.

144
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
This is your name.

145
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Are you still happy?

146
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
Have you ever thought that

147
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
if you weren't the main demon,

148
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
what would happen to the demon?

149
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
What are you talking about?

150
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
I've heard that there's no need to be worried.

151
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
That's a place outside the world.

152
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
I don't want to tell you a story here.

153
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
I'm not interested in telling a story.

154
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
But as a master of the demon,

155
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,020
aren't you curious about where the demon is from?

156
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Wu You Jing.

157
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
It's the forest of the million demons

158
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
in this world.

159
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Every 12 years,

160
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
the forest of Wu You grass is scattered.

161
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,020
It's a secret path that leads to the open road.

162
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,020
It's the same as the world.

163
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
It's the forest that is scattered.

164
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
It's the same as the world.

165
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
No matter how much you go,

166
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
you'll get nothing.

167
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
But if you get the forest,

168
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
you can open the forest and become a demon.

169
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
The demon clan is in the west.

170
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
There's a way out.

171
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
It's so secret.

172
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
No one can see it.

173
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
The strongest demon clan of the Xuan Bao

174
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
is the real one.

175
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,020
The highest in the Xuan Bao clan is my father,

176
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Yue Yan.

177
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,020
And you are also my son.

178
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,020
My mother, Bao Di.

179
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
My name is Man Ying.

180
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,020
You think I'm a demon?

181
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
Yes.

182
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
12 years ago,

183
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
you were the one who saved a girl

184
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
and was sent to the forest.

185
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,020
You left the world here.

186
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Now Wu You Jing is about to open again.

187
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,020
I came to the forest in advance

188
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
and brought you back.

189
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
Actually, I thought about it a lot before I came.

190
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
I thought you would refuse.

191
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
I thought you would not want to go back.

192
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
I even thought you would have

193
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,020
the reason and reason to stand on your own feet.

194
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,020
But I never thought it would be like this now.

195
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,020
You actually lost your memory,

196
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,020
and you risked your life to live in the dark.

197
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
You are so ridiculous.

198
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Listen to me.

199
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
I am born in Guangping.

200
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
I have a father and a mother.

201
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,020
I am the main thing of Ganshan Hall.

202
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
I am the heir to the Eighth Gate.

203
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
It's not like you said anything in your mouth.

204
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
As a demon,

205
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
you have not only become a demon,

206
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
but also become a man of the immortal.

207
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Good.

208
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
Good.

209
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
Should I praise you?

210
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
I don't allow you to insult my parents.

211
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
Parents?

212
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
It seems that I said nothing.

213
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
You won't show up.

214
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,020
I won't answer you.

215
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Even if I forcefully take you back now,

216
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
it doesn't make any sense.

217
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
But you can't lie to yourself for long.

218
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,020
You should feel it right.

219
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
And I am also curious.

220
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
If your family and friends know that you are a demon,

221
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
what will they do?

222
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,020
They will accept you as they wish.

223
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,020
They will accept you as they wish.

224
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I have learned a sentence in the world recently.

225
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
It makes sense.

226
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
It's called,

227
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
I am not a demon.

228
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
I am a demon.

229
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
I will come to you

230
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
when I cherish your time.

231
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
You're not a demon.

232
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
I am a demon.

233
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
I am a demon.

234
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Fan Xiang,

235
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
why are you here?

236
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Xuanyi is not here.

237
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
What do you mean?

238
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,020
It's better that we go to a good time together.

239
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
But I just went to see Shantang and he is not here.

240
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,540
The department of the nine-story tea house, Wu Fang,

241
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,420
have you found them?

242
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,220
No.

243
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,420
It's mainly Chi Xue who said

244
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,980
that yesterday,

245
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,580
she got a demon beast into the hall.

246
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,260
Demon beast?

247
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,500
What kind of demon beast?

248
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,700
Why are you here?

249
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm here to find Lord Geng.

250
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,140
Do you have time to inform me?

251
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,380
What kind of demon beast are you talking about?

252
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,980
Chi Xue didn't say anything.

253
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,540
He just said it was a monster.

254
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,580
And it was powerful.

255
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,860
What about Chi Xue now?

256
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,300
He's fine.

257
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
The demon beast seems to be just about to faint.

258
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,540
That means,

259
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,860
Chi Xue didn't see Xuan Ye

260
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,060
and the demon beast.

261
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,340
No.

262
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,340
You should be more careful.

263
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,260
Xuan Ye came to the underground city

264
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,980
to get some rest.

265
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,260
There shouldn't be any danger.

266
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,060
I think he's going to chase the demon beast.

267
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,580
We can't wait any longer.

268
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,940
How about you go home and wait?

269
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,020
Okay.

270
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,020
I'll go first.

271
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll tell you what's going on.

272
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,540
Don't worry too much.

273
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,220
Xuan Ye.

274
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,380
Where did you go?

275
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,900
I've been looking for you for a long time.

276
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,140
Where did you go?

277
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,460
Chi Xue said he's in the house.

278
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,900
You went after him?

279
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,980
Demon beast?

280
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,860
Yes.

281
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,780
He said the demon beast is very powerful.

282
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,300
He fainted immediately.

283
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,900
You weren't at home last night.

284
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,460
I'll go ask Chi Xue first.

285
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,100
I'll go with you.

286
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,740
No need.

287
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,740
You go home first.

288
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,260
I'll go ask him first.

289
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,100
Okay.

290
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,100
Xuan Ye.

291
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,940
You're back.

292
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,700
Chi Xue.

293
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,500
Ban Xia said she had a demon beast at home last night.

294
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,580
Is it true?

295
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,700
What kind of demon beast is it?

296
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,740
He fainted very quickly.

297
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,860
He's very powerful.

298
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,780
I didn't react and fainted.

299
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
I didn't see it clearly.

300
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,420
You didn't see it?

301
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,180
I thought you went after him.

302
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,660
Xuan Ye.

303
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,020
I'm not going.

304
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,380
The demon beast is not good at dealing with it.

305
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,420
I'll stay and help you.

306
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,500
Okay.

307
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,700
Okay.

308
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,380
Have you ever thought...

309
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,260
what would happen if you were not the demon beast?

310
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:35,640
contraption of the

311
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,920
new

312
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,520
aura

313
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
But they can't fool Yue Chong.

314
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,520
So they have another name.

315
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
It's called the Eye of the Demon.

316
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Is there any way to fool Yue Chong?

317
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Not much.

318
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,520
The Eye of the Demon

319
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
It's all cut out.

320
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
What a coincidence.

321
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Or it's cut out.

322
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
It's not like you.

323
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
You're the one who killed the girl.

324
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Not like you.

325
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Ban Xia, what are you cutting?

326
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
Let me see.

327
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
It's obvious.

328
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
It's me.

329
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
It's a cat.

330
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Did you cut a cat?

331
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
I think it's like a tiger.

332
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I think it's like a tiger.

333
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Where's Xuan Ye?

334
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
He went out.

335
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Where did he go?

336
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I don't know.

337
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I didn't see him today.

338
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Such an important day.

339
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Why did Xuan Ye go out?

340
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Exactly.

341
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
You're drunk.

342
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
You talk so much.

343
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
You're not doing anything.

344
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

345
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm just chatting.

346
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Xuan Ye, where did you go?

347
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I went out to do something.

348
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Xuan Ye, did you go to the table?

349
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Did you just say that you broke into your family's medicine?

350
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Yes.

351
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Are you blind?

352
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Not yet.

353
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Don't worry.

354
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Don't worry.

355
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Mr. Geng knows about this.

356
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I also informed the outside hunters.

357
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Once he finds out the monster's trace,

358
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
he'll come to the front door to report.

359
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
That's a demon.

360
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
What's the use of looking for a hunter?

361
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
What's the use of a demon?

362
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
He can't even draw a human shape.

363
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
It means there's no blood-sucking.

364
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Why can't the hunter do it?

365
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
He's not blood-sucking.

366
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
He'll faint if he's blood-sucking.

367
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
It only means he has hidden power.

368
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
You have hidden power, too.

369
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Did you beat me?

370
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Right, Xuan Ye?

371
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Xuan Ye.

372
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Did you really go to the table?

373
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Yes.

374
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Chi Xue said that the medicine was very powerful.

375
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Do you need to ask some other helpers?

376
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
It's okay.

377
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
No need.

378
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Xuan Ye.

379
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Tomorrow, we're getting engaged.

380
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
You'll be a family member.

381
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
So no matter what you do,

382
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
you can't be so poor like before.

383
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Did you hear me?

384
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
I know.

385
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
You look so tired.

386
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Lie down and rest for a while.

387
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Okay.

388
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Okay.

389
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
What's wrong?

390
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
There's a great power in the Xuan Bao Clan.

391
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
My father did it.

392
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Yue Yan.

393
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
And you are also my father's son.

394
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
My brother named Man Ying.

395
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
You said I'm a demon?

396
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Yes.

397
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Xuan Ye.

398
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Xuan Ye.

399
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Xuan Ye.

400
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Xuan Ye, what's wrong with you?

401
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Xuan Ye.

402
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Xuan Ye.

403
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Xuan Ye.

404
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Xuan Ye.

405
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Xuan Ye.

406
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Xuan Ye.

407
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Did you see Xuan...

408
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Xuan Ye.

409
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Xuan Ye.

410
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Xuan Ye.

411
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Xuan Ye.

412
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Did you hear that?

413
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
Last night, you were a demon again.

414
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Really?

415
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Someone saw it with their own eyes.

416
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
They said it was a black demon.

417
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
There really is a demon in this world.

418
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
There's a demon in that world?

419
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I heard it was a book of the Ya Men.

420
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
I heard that the Gaon masters are all catching demons.

421
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Miss.

422
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
It's a war today.

423
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
You don't have to go out.

424
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
What do you think is good about this job?

425
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
What do you think is good about this job?

426
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Dr. Qiu wants to come.

427
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
We received the letter.

428
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
We went to Guangping.

429
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,520
I didn't expect to meet another joy.

430
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Ying He.

431
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
You are so bold.

432
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
You must have a good fortune.

433
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
I dare not believe it.

434
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I came here to confirm it.

435
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Is it your personal letter?

436
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,520
This time, it's really too much.

437
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
If we personally give it a try,

438
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
who will say that?

439
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
I dare not believe it.

440
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
You said that the girl in the middle of the night

441
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
looks weak and weak.

442
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
I didn't expect to be so bold.

443
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
It's thanks to Eunuch.

444
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Otherwise, how can she fight with a demon?

445
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Eunuch is already a son-in-law.

446
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Yan Qiu.

447
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I heard that the letter in the middle of the night

448
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
is also a good thing.

449
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Yes.

450
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
He saved me.

451
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
He is a reliable person.

452
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
He won't make a mistake in the next class.

453
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Ding Zhou.

454
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Is it really not here?

455
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,520
I think it's here.

456
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
I'll go and have a look.

457
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Don't worry.

458
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
There is no elder in the family.

459
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,520
He is very busy with his work.

460
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Yes.

461
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Uncle.

462
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Da Xia, why are you here?

463
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Is Xuan Yin not here yet?

464
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Your brother has gone to look for her.

465
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I'm going too.

466
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Fan Xiang.

467
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Fan Xiang.

468
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Xuan Yin.

469
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Xuan Yin.

470
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Xuan Yin.

471
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Xuan Yin.

472
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Open the door.

473
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
What time is it?

474
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Listen.

475
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Fan Xiang.

476
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
When did you come?

477
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
We just arrived.

478
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
There is a monster nearby.

479
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
What monster?

480
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
It's a black demon.

481
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Open the door.

482
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Open the door.

483
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Open the door.

484
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Xuan Yin.

485
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Xuan Yin.

486
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Xuan Yin.

487
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Xuan Yin.

488
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Xuan Yin.

489
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Open the door.

490
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Go and look for her.

491
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Xuan Yin.

492
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
Did you find her?

493
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
No.

494
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Miss.

495
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
The door behind is open.

496
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Let's go outside and look for her.

497
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
Miss.

498
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Miss.

499
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Miss.

500
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Miss.

501
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I can't get out.

502
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Did you find Xuan Yin?

503
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Xuan Yin may have been in trouble.

504
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
I passed by.

505
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
There were a few more people yesterday.

506
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
The monster that I saw.

507
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
He and Chi Xue might have been out of the monster.

508
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
What monster?

509
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
It's a monster.

510
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
I think it's a monster.

511
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
I found it.

512
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
There was a monster.

513
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
What kind of monster?

514
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
It's a monster.

515
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
It's a monster.

516
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
I didn't know that.

517
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
It's a monster.

518
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
It's a monster.

519
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
It's a monster.

520
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
It's a monster.

521
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
What monster?

522
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
It's said to be a black demon.

523
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Miss.

524
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Anxia, what's wrong?

525
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Anxia, do you know anything?

526
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Have you seen that monster?

527
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Anxia.

528
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Anxia.

529
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Don't worry.

530
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Xuanye is capable.

531
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Even if that monster is there,

532
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
it's still hard to get him.

533
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
We can't ask him to go out with your brother.

534
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
We'll keep looking for him.

535
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
How about you go home first

536
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
and wait for our news?

537
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Miss.

538
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Tingzhu.

539
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Miss.

540
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Miss, please go.

541
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Don't you think it's strange?

542
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
How strange?

543
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I met a demon in Shandong before.

544
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
It has something to do with Xuanye.

545
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Why didn't you tell me before?

546
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,520
Did I tell you?

547
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Why did you bleed?

548
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
How did you get it?

549
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Xuanye may have some trouble.

550
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
I passed away.

551
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
There were several people who saw that demon last night.

552
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
He and Chi Xue might have gone out.

553
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
They might have gone out for a while.

554
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
They might have gone out for a while.

555
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
I think that's why they didn't tell me.

556
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
They might have gone out for a while.

557
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
They might have gone out for a while.

558
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
They might have gone out for a while.

559
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
I think it's strange.

560
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
I think that demon is with Chi Xue.

561
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
He and Chi Xue might have gone out for a while.

562
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
What demon?

563
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
It's said that it's the Black Panther.

564
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
The Black Panther

565
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Who is it?

566
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Who is it?

567
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Who is it?

568
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Father.

569
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I heard that you saw someone.

570
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
I heard that you saw someone.

571
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
I saw a person hiding there.

572
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Xuanye.

573
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
It must be Xuanye.

574
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Xuanye.

575
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Xuanye, come out.

576
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Xuanye.

577
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Baixia.

578
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Baixia.

579
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
What's wrong?

580
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Mother, I heard that you saw Xuanye.

581
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
I can't be sure.

582
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
I saw a person hiding there.

583
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Baixia.

584
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Miss.

585
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Xuanye.

586
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Xuanye.

587
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
Xuanye.

588
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Xuanye.

589
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Xuanye.

590
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Xuanye, don't joke around.

591
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Come out.

592
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Come out.

593
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I'm really angry.

594
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
I'm really angry.

595
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I'm really angry.

596
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
I'm really angry.

597
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
I'm sorry.

598
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
I'm sorry.

599
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm really sorry.

600
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm sorry.

601
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
I knew it when I was leaving.

602
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
But...

603
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,520
But I don't know how to tell you.

604
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
I pushed you away from me.

605
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
Xuanye.

606
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Xuanye.

607
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
I'm not angry.

608
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
I should have told you earlier.

609
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I really don't care.

610
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,520
I really don't care.

611
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Xuanye.

612
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
I'm sorry.

613
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Can you come back?

614
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
I'm sorry.

615
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
It's all my fault.

616
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm sorry.

617
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Xuanye.

619
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Miss.

620
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Xuanye.

621
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
I heard your voice.

622
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Xuanye, look.

623
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Xuanye.

624
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Miss.

625
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Xuanye.

626
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Xuanye.

627
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Xuanye.

628
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Xuanye.

629
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Go back home.

630
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Go back home.

631
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Manxia.

636
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Go and check.

637
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
I'll call you back.

638
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Okay.

639
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Xuanye sent you a letter.

640
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Do you want to see it?

641
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,520
He said that your marriage was just for himself, but he didn't say the reason.

642
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Fan Xia, do you know the reason?

643
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,520
You don't want to say it, then forget it.

644
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,320
Although he is a mischievous person,

645
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,320
he is our family's benefactor, and I can't blame him for that.

646
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
I didn't want to marry him.

647
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,320
He is a drug dealer, and he is always in a dangerous situation.

648
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,320
I only have one daughter.

649
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,320
We have separated for a year.

650
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,320
I don't want to see you in danger.

651
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,320
You didn't convince me.

652
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:43,320
I didn't expect that your mother's health is almost the same.

653
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Fan Xia, let's go back to Nanyang with Uncle.

654
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Don't you miss your grandmother?

655
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,320
She knows that I was happy in the forest with your mother.

656
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
She didn't sleep for several nights.

657
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,320
She is already old. We should go back and see her.

658
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Fan Xia.

659
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,320
If you can't tell us anything, just let it go.

660
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,320
When the time is right, maybe we can move to the next level.

661
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
But I don't want to see you anymore.

662
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
You stay here.

663
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
It's useless.

664
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
What's the matter?

665
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Tell me.

666
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Go and ask grandfather how to do this.

667
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,320
If I tolerate him more...

668
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
If they don't tell me how to take care of him...

669
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Please go.

670
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Ok.

671
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Xun Yi, I finally found you.

672
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Xun Xun, let's go!

673
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
I'm not leaving.

674
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Why are you like a demon?

675
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Xun Yi!

676
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Let's go.

677
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
I can't control myself anymore.

678
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Let's go!

679
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Xun Yi!

680
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
Xun Yi!

681
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
You are the Xun Baoyi clan.

682
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,320
I will never leave my heart to shine.

683
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,320
I will never leave my heart to shine.

684
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,320
I will never leave my heart to shine.

685
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Before I die.

686
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,320
You are the one who will never forget.

687
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:28,320
I will never leave my heart to shine.

688
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Love is an producer of song.

689
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Demonstration is in an altitude
