of a little bit of a

76
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
We've arrived at the house.

77
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Where are we going?

78
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
To work.

79
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Isn't everyone dead?

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm going to the house.

81
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Dad is back.

82
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Dad.

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Dad.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Dad.

85
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
What's wrong?

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Hold it.

87
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
What was that sound?

88
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I fell down.

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
It's okay.

90
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
You fell down?

91
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Where did you fall?

92
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
It's okay.

93
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Why aren't you sleeping?

94
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Why are you sleeping?

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm hungry.

96
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
I went to get something to eat.

97
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Dad, when did you come back?

98
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Just now.

99
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
I just came back.

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
A lot of things happened at home.

101
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Do you know?

102
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
It's that new sister-in-law.

103
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I'll go in and tell you.

104
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Bai Xiang.

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
If you have anything to say,

106
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
let's talk tomorrow.

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Dad is busy with his work.

108
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
He's been tired for a day.

109
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
He wants to rest.

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Are you really okay?

111
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Bai Xiang.

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
What can I do?

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Dad is really tired.

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Dad.

115
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Then you should rest early.

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Grandma has been asking about you.

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
You should visit her early tomorrow morning.

118
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I haven't dyed your hair for a long time.

119
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
I'll dye your hair tomorrow.

120
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Okay.

121
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm going back first.

122
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Bai Xiang.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
It's dark.

124
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Walk slowly.

125
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
I know.

126
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
After I leave,

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I can't read anymore.

128
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I know.

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
One...

130
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Elaine...

131
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
You're my friend.

132
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Elaine...

133
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Elaine...

134
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,760
Yanzi Stir-fried Rice Seed

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,640
What's your name?

136
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,940
My name's Medha!

137
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,720
Miss.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
What's wrong?

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
You had a nightmare again?

140
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
You dreamed of the full moon?

141
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Tingzhao,

142
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
do you think the full moon is real?

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Here it comes again.

144
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Miss,

145
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
the doctor said it was just a dream.

146
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
What is in the dream?

147
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Bathing,

148
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
blacking out,

149
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
how can it be real?

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
But if there is a demon in this world,

151
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
does it mean

152
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
my dream is real?

153
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
The person inside is real?

154
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Is the full moon also real?

155
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Miss,

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
you'd better think about

157
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
how to answer the old lady's question.

158
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Master has been out for several days.

159
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
The old lady is obviously angry.

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
My father is back.

161
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Back?

162
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
When?

163
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Last night.

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Go get some water.

165
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
I need to wash up and find my father.

166
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Okay.

167
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Wipe it carefully.

168
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Okay. Wipe it again.

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Go to your house.

170
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Miss.

171
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Is my father in his room?

172
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Is the second master back?

173
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Is the second master back?

174
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Move.

175
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
It's so hot.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah.

177
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
It's so hot.

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Brother.

179
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Brother.

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
How could this happen?

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
How could this happen?

182
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
My father.

183
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
My father.

184
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
My father.

185
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Why is he here?

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
This house

187
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
was originally a mansion

188
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
on the Yunqing Market.

189
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
He used to make money

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
by renting a house.

191
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
My father rented this place.

192
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
He lived here for several days.

193
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
So when the second master

194
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
was in the fire,

195
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
the fire was very big.

196
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
He soon got to this house.

197
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
My father

198
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
was in a state of helplessness

199
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
and hid in the study.

200
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
In the end,

201
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
he was buried in there.

202
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
My sister died in there.

203
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
My second brother.

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Brother.

205
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
It's impossible.

206
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
When I was in the third cell yesterday,

207
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I saw my father.

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
My father was so thin and haggard.

209
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I saw a lot of white hairs.

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
We agreed to dye our hair together today.

211
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Really.

212
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Lan Xia.

213
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Lan Xia, believe me.

214
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
I saw him last night. He didn't die.

215
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Lan Xia.

216
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
The truth is right in front of you.

217
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Don't you believe it?

218
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
You must have made a mistake.

219
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
My father didn't die.

220
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
My father didn't die.

221
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
I saw him.

222
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
I saw him.

223
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
He didn't die.

224
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
My father didn't die.

225
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
It must be his destiny.

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
My father didn't die.

227
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Lan Xia.

228
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
What are you doing?

229
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm fishing for eels.

230
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Eels are half-dead animals.

231
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
If they die,

232
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
eels will definitely avenge them.

233
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
You said eels are born with bad eyesight.

234
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
But they are strong.

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
They like beautiful sounds.

236
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I can lure them here.

237
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
You mean beautiful sounds?

238
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Isn't it nice?

239
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
If you don't blow,

240
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
they might come faster.

241
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I can't catch them.

242
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Here they come.

243
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I can't catch them.

244
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Shi Xuan.

245
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Shi Xuan.

246
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Shi Xuan, look at the rope.

247
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
You can't escape.

248
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Shi Xuan.

249
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Shi Xuan.

250
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Shi Xuan.

251
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Shi Xuan.

252
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Shi Xuan.

253
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Shi Xuan.

254
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Shi Xuan.

255
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Shi Xuan.

256
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Shi Xuan.

257
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Shi Xuan.

258
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Shi Xuan.

259
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Shi Xuan.

260
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Shi Xuan.

261
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Shi Xuan.

262
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Shi Xuan.

263
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Shi Xuan.

264
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Shi Xuan.

265
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Shi Xuan.

266
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Shi Xuan.

267
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Shi Xuan.

268
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Shi Xuan.

269
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Shi Xuan.

270
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Shi Xuan.

271
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Shi Xuan.

272
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Shi Xuan.

273
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Shi Xuan.

274
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Shi Xuan.

275
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,320
It's okay. It's a nice day.

276
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,520
I came out for a walk.

277
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,720
Are you going back to the city? Do you want to go together?

278
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,920
I don't feel like going.

279
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,320
You feel like going? No matter where Dr. Jiu goes,

280
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,120
you and I feel like going.

281
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,720
Chi Xun, let's go.

282
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,720
Let's get married.

283
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,720
Chi Xun, let's go.

284
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,720
This... Is this a thief, Miss?

285
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,720
Chi Xun, let's go.

286
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,520
Chi Xun, let's go.

287
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,920
Why is it so messy?

288
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,320
Should I go out?

289
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Miss, Miss, come here.

290
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Look.

291
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Look.

292
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Why can't I see anyone in this mirror?

293
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Miss, Miss, come here.

294
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Miss, Miss, come here.

295
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
My poor child.

296
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Since I was a little girl, she's gone.

297
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Now, I'm gone too.

298
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
From now on, you're alone, alone in the world.

299
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,320
But how am I going to live?

300
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Grandma, don't be sad.

301
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,320
My father might still be alive.

302
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,320
The night before, I saw my father go home.

303
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
He was in his room.

304
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,320
He was still in a good mood, but he looked a little tired.

305
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,320
He said it was because he had to organize his books and he didn't rest well.

306
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
So I didn't talk to him much.

307
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,420
On the way back to the room, I heard the sound of the

308
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,320
sound of the three voices.

309
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,320
But the papers in the government office say that my father died of a second stroke.

310
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Think about it. How could a person who died of a second stroke

311
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
still be able to go home?

312
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
There must be something wrong with this.

313
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
My father must still be alive.

314
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
This...

315
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Is this a ghost?

316
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Miss, I know you're upset.

317
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
But...

318
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Uncle, I'm not saying this because I'm too upset.

319
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,320
You know that I have different eyes from other people.

320
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,320
If ghosts and monsters are around, I can tell.

321
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Uncle lives in the Eastern Courtyard and you live in the West Courtyard.

322
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
They're very far apart.

323
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,320
If you don't sleep at night, why would you go to Uncle's room?

324
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
I didn't go from my room.

325
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
When I came back from outside, I saw my father's room lit up.

326
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
I went to take a look.

327
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
It's so late. What are you going out for?

328
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I...

329
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
I went to meet a friend.

330
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
You live in the South China Sea all year round.

331
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Why do you have friends in the South China Sea?

332
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
I didn't lie.

333
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Manager Xu.

334
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
When I came back, I saw Manager Xu changing the candles.

335
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
His hand was burned at that time.

336
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I saw him first and then saw my father.

337
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Young Master, my hand was hurt when I changed the candle the night before.

338
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
It happened to be a child's hand.

339
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Miss, I didn't see you when I changed the candle.

340
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
I came back too late.

341
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I was afraid that I would be blamed for my grandmother's death, so I hid.

342
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Uncle Xu's hand injury is not a secret.

343
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
This can't prove that what you said is true.

344
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I know that this is hard to believe.

345
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,320
But don't you think it's strange?

346
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,320
My father and I came back for my brother's wedding.

347
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
But he rented a house outside.

348
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
He didn't come back often.

349
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
He seems to be hiding something.

350
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Uncle Xu asked me to rent this house.

351
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
He said he wanted to organize the book.

352
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
He didn't want to avoid anyone.

353
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
There are storms and storms.

354
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
There are also worries.

355
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Lan Xia, I know you can't accept Uncle Xu's death.

356
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,320
But you have to tell me the truth.

357
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Stop! Mirror!

358
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
I found this mirror in my father's room.

359
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
He can only see things that can't be seen.

360
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
I went to the fire scene in Penglai.

361
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I also found the same thing.

362
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Isn't this strange enough?

363
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
This...

364
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
How could this be?

365
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Impossible.

366
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I couldn't find anything yesterday.

367
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
I heard you saw it.

368
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Yes, I saw it too.

369
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
This can't find a shadow.

370
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I know.

371
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,320
It must be a powerful demon.

372
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
It used the eye-opening spell.

373
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
So we can't see it.

374
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
I know a main demon.

375
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Lan Xia!

376
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Stop.

377
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Take your lady back to her room.

378
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Why?

379
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Why can't you believe me even once?

380
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
I'll take you to the Monastery later.

381
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
To see Dr. Sun.

382
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm not dead!

383
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I told you my father is alive!

384
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
These are all demons!

385
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Demons?

386
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Demons again?

387
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Why can only you see those demons?

388
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Why can't I see any of them?

389
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
You've seen it.

390
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
You've all seen it!

391
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,320
But you can't see its disguise.

392
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
You don't think that

393
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Sister-in-law was kidnapped by a man, right?

394
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
He's a demon.

395
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
A man with a smile on his face.

396
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
A man with a beautiful body.

397
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
A man with a happy life.

398
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Shut up!

399
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Please come in.

400
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Sir, please come in.

401
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Sir, please come in.

402
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Sir, please come in.

403
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Mr. Chang.

404
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Sir, please come in.

405
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Sir, this is your first time here.

406
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Please come in.

407
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
This way.

408
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Have another drink.

409
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
This is my first time here.

410
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
This way.

411
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Did you see that?

412
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
You hit me?

413
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Mr. Song!

414
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Why did you leave?

415
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Sir,

416
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Chun Tao,

417
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
she has a guest today.

418
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
How about I arrange another girl for you?

419
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I won't disturb you then.

420
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Chun Tao, take good care of him.

421
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Sir,

422
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
your hand is...

423
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
You are a traitor!

424
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Miss,

425
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
if you meet any trouble,

426
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
you can come to Guangping City to find me.

427
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Miss,

428
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
it's time to take your medicine.

429
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
They don't believe me.

430
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
You don't believe me either?

431
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Of course I believe you.

432
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
But what's the use of me

433
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
believing you alone?

434
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
They don't believe you.

435
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
You don't need them?

436
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
I haven't found her for so long.

437
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
Could she have gone far away?

438
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
No.

439
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,320
She must be nearby.

440
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Why?

441
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
The password is different from other drugs.

442
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
The sound of the beauty is food

443
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
and medicine to her.

444
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
She must be in the city

445
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
to heal herself.

446
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
She is so evil.

447
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
What's wrong?

448
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
The cure is in the medicine.

449
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
It has been a whole night.

450
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Why hasn't she come out yet?

451
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
That's right!

452
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Mother,

453
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,320
how about we report this?

454
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Mother,

455
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
it's a matter of life and death.

456
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Okay,

457
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,320
let's report this.

458
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Qiu Sheng,

459
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
come here.

460
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
You're the fastest.

461
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Go to the yard and ask Song to bring more people.

462
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Go!

463
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Yes.

464
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Why are you in a panic?

465
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Do you know Song?

466
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Yes.

467
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Let's go and report this.

468
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Report?

469
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Let's go.

470
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Excuse me,

471
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
are you...

472
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
You're not a bad singer.

473
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
If you keep playing,

474
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
you'll get a cold.

475
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Little lady,

476
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
you're awake?

477
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
You're wearing a coat.

478
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Aren't you cold?

479
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Run!

480
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Run!

481
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
No!

482
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,320
You're getting uglier.

483
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
You're getting uglier.

484
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
You're getting uglier.

485
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
You're getting uglier.

486
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
You're getting uglier.

487
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
You're getting uglier.

488
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
You're getting uglier.

489
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
You're getting uglier.

490
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,320
You're getting uglier.

491
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
You're getting uglier.

492
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
You're getting uglier.

493
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
You're getting uglier.

494
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
You're getting uglier.

495
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,320
You're getting uglier.

496
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
You're getting uglier.

497
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
You're getting uglier.

498
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
You're getting uglier.

499
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
Shi Xue, take him away!

500
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,120
I was being very descriptive

501
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,240
charge VII

502
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,300
learning office

503
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,200
personnel

504
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,880
I won't let you go

505
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,160
Gu glamor

506
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,460
You won't be able to go

507
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,060
It starts well

508
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,260
He's a bit talented.

509
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,340
He has a good taste.

510
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,620
Bai Xia.

511
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,340
I have news about Man Niang.

512
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,660
Do you remember

513
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,620
the criminal who killed the Marquis

514
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,140
in the city recently?

515
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,540
The official document of the document

516
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,540
that the murderer

517
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,460
was Man Niang.

518
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,980
Do you believe it?

519
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,500
I'll go back and investigate.

520
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,100
You still don't believe it?

521
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,700
Of course I don't believe it.

522
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,500
She's just a weak woman.

523
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,820
I'll continue to investigate.

524
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,380
But no matter what,

525
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,820
there's no end to the world.

526
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,860
It's settled.

527
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,660
So don't think about it anymore.

528
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,420
Now,

529
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,260
even if Uncle is not here,

530
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,820
we'll take good care of you.

531
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,300
I understand.

532
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,580
It's raining.

533
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,540
I'll take you back.

534
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,740
No need.

535
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,620
I can go back by myself.

536
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,220
Go back and rest early.

537
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,300
Okay.

538
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Miss, I've packed everything.

539
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,780
Okay.

540
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,460
Let's go.

541
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,740
It's raining.

542
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,820
Uncle,

543
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,900
is there a crossroad

544
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,420
that leads to Guangping?

545
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,300
Do you know

546
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,340
when the ship

547
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,380
will arrive?

548
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,340
Every day at noon.

549
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,060
You're going to Guangping by boat?

550
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,140
There's only one time a day.

551
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,740
It's raining so hard.

552
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,340
I'm afraid you won't make it today.

553
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,140
Wait for tomorrow.

554
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,340
Miss,

555
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,220
let's go back.

556
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,740
Yes.

557
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,140
When will it stop raining?

558
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,100
Let's go.

559
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,260
What about him?

560
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,020
I'll deal with him

561
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,300
when the night of the full moon comes.

562
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,420
Okay.

563
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,220
You're a demon too.

564
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,700
You're so rude to your peers.

565
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,780
I'm different from him.

566
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,900
He's very stupid.

567
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,340
If I were to meet

568
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,380
such a powerful opponent like you,

569
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,220
I'd probably run out of ideas.

570
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,460
All half-bred demons are loyal.

571
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,380
Once you've decided who the master is,

572
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,820
you'll be able to get rid of him.

573
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,580
I'll be waiting for you.

574
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,340
I'll be waiting for you.

575
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,180
I've killed Ren Nian Xiao.

576
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,940
He'll take revenge for his master.

577
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,540
He'll be with his enemy

578
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,340
for a long time.

579
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,180
He's loyal to the demon.

580
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,940
Watch him.

581
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,860
Amazing!

582
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
You're back pretty fast this time.

583
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300
I didn't catch up with your wedding.

584
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
It's okay. It's okay.

585
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
There's still next time.

586
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Next time?

587
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
You still know to come back?

588
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Look at how long you've been wearing this pair of shoes.

589
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
It's so dirty.

590
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
I'll go wash it for you.

591
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
Second brother.

592
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
I finally know what Yue Chong likes to eat.

593
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,300
They like to drink Yang Hui Soup.

594
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Don't put any oil, salt, or vinegar in it.

595
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
Just boil it with water for a few hours.

596
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
It's clean when you blink.

597
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Wait.

598
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
Wait for my Long Yue Chong to grow big and strong.

599
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300
I'll hold it for you.

600
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Even if you know the 100-year-old demon, you have to run away.

601
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Did it go well this time?

602
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Son.

603
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,300
People are good and evil.

604
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
The demon has good and bad.

605
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
You can't just stand there and watch.

606
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Do you remember?

607
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
I remember.

608
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,300
The starry sky is very bright.

609
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
It's delicious.

610
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,300
The Moon and the Sky

611
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,300
The Moon and the Sky

612
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
The Moon and the Sky

613
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Listen to me, Immortal Li Er.

614
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,300
I have opened my eyes before the sword

615
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,300
and I have a good marriage that I don't want to ask for

616
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,300
The second day of the month is cold

617
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,300
I am willing to give up

618
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,300
I am not greedy for the mirror

619
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,300
I am not asking for the beast's eyes

620
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
The third day of the month is dark

621
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,300
I am willing to kiss the moon

622
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,300
I am willing to open the flower and give birth to a child

623
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,300
I am willing to give up

624
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,300
I only want to be a young man

625
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,300
I am willing to give up

626
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,300
I only want to be a young man

627
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Eat

628
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Eat

629
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Eat

630
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Eat

631
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300

Peace and quiet

640
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Who is it?

641
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,300
Eat

642
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Eat and sleep

643
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,300
Go back

644
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
Hurry up

645
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Boss, hang up

646
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Buy some small mushrooms

647
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,300
The third day of the month is dark

648
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,300
The fourth day of the month is dark

649
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
Peace and quiet

650
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,300
The third day of the month is dark

651
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Peace and quiet

652
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,300
The third day of the month is dark

653
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300

Peace and rush

663
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,880
The sun is

664
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,300
If memory will progress in a short time

665
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,300
push

666
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,300
If Chen Ai will burn on the bottom

667
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,300
I'm sorry.

668
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
