Well, you see,

he's a heavy drinker

181

and often goes traveling with friends.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Sometimes, he'd be gone for three

to five months.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,910
That's why I didn't report it.

185

May I ask, My Lord,

186
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,550
has something happened?

187

Dead?

191

He drank himself to death?

This Zhang fellow

193
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,080
was no good.

I've said it before—

198
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,670
if he kept drinking like that,

199
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,550
he'd drink himself to death sooner or later.

Judging by the torn clothing,

they were likely caused by the fall.

Ever since we left the world in the painting,

it was all just a painting, wasn't it?

345
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,560
What confuses me most is that

346
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,610
it seems impossible for me to move on

347
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,660
from that world.

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,570
And I'm not sure

you must have noticed

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,859
that Banxia likes Xuanye, right?

364
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,200
Banxia likes Xuanye?

365
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,840
How is that possible?

366

you're so clueless.

I'm almost certain

that Xuanye likes Banxia too.

384

Please stand up first.

However,

391

if you ask me to repay it

392

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
where do you live?

530
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,340
Why are you alone

531
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
in these wild mountains?

532
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,150
I live in Guangping City.

533
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,880
Guangping?

534
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,070
What a coincidence!

535
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,920
My fiancée

536
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,160
also lives in Guangping.

537
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,750
We're going there

538
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,830
to bring her back.

539
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:32,650
If

540
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,110
you're planning to return home,

541
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,370
why not travel with us?

542
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,790
How far is this place

543
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,350
from Guangping City?

544
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,030
How far?

545
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,920
Young Master, this is

546
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,250
the outskirts of Tanzhou.

547
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,140
About three miles ahead

548
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,100
is Tanzhou City.

549
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,370
Guangping

550
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,060
is about three days from here.

551
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,680
Banxia.

552
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,310
Where is he?

553
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,210
I don't know.

554
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,000
When I got up this morning,

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,130
he was already gone.

556
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,160
Banxia.

557
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,230
Father.

558
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,690
You went next door?

559
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,970
But Xuanye isn't home.

560
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,600
If there's nothing else,

561
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,860
I'll go back to my room.

562
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,870
Finally done for the day.

563
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,030
Banxia,

564
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,750
stop bustling about.

565
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,430
Come and have some pastries.

566
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,880
These cardamom cakes you made are so good.

567
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,940
Just as good as the ones sold outside.

568
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,210
Aren't you eating, Banxia?

569
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,200
Banxia?

570
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,440
What's wrong with you?

571
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
You seem distracted.

572
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm fine.

573
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,950
It's about your good neighbor again, isn't it?

574
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,400
It's just—

575
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,860
he left early this morning

576
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,040
without saying where he was going.

577
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
He didn't leave any message?

578
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,510
He barely goes out?

579
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,890
And he tells you every time he does?

580
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,200
Not every time.

581
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,790
But our relationship

582
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,230
is kind of different now.

583
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,030
Different how?

584
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,590
You two took an oath

585
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,920
to be together forever?

586
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
It seems to me that

587
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,270
you're

588
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,700
carrying a torch for him.

589
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,500
Last time I saw him,

590
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,040
he didn't look too happy.

591
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,680
He's just been

592
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,900
a bit strange lately.

593
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,610
What do you like about him anyway?

594
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,320
I think he's quite ordinary.

595
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
I mean, sure—

596
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,000
he's kind of nice-looking,

597
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,090
knows a bit of medicine

598
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,070
and martial arts,

599
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,510
and owns a house and shop.

600
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,720
His wife doesn't need to serve his parents

601
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,960
or deal with

602
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,180
the sisters-in-law.

603
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,350
Come to think of it,

604
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,350
he's actually got great qualities.

605
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,720
No wonder you like him.

606
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,980
Even I'm a bit tempted.

607
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,790
That's not why I like him.

608
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
It's because when I'm with him,

609
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
I feel at ease.

610
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,240
At ease?

611
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,350
No matter what I do,

612
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,700
as long as he's around,

613
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,880
I don't feel afraid.

614
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,650
You've really fallen for him.

615
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,110
Enough about me.

616
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,240
Your house is so big and bright.

617
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
It must have cost quite a bit, right?

618
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,720
Someone just died nearby.

619
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,960
It's considered a bit ominous,

620
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,220
so the rent is cheaper.

621
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,110
Besides,

622
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,550
it's close to the market.

623
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,480
So I moved in.

624
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,000
You're really brave.

625
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,150
Every patch of land buries someone.

626
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,360
I'm not afraid at all.

627
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,550
You vicious tramp!

628
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,590
Vicious tramp, come out!

629
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,550
You vicious tramp.

630
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,060
You cheated and caused my second uncle's death.

631
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,240
Today I'm here to get justice

632
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,960
for my uncle!

633
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,000
That's right! Justice!

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,720
Justice!

635
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
I didn't cheat. I didn't!

636
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,840
Nonsense!

637
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,320
If you hadn't cheated,

638
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,400
why didn't you report it

639
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,620
when my uncle went missing?

640
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,630
You clearly had something to hide!

641
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,240
Yeah!

642
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,700
Someone like you

643
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,310
should be expelled from the Zhang family!

644
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,440
Yes, expel her!

645
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,070
That's right.

646
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,110
A heartless,

647
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,020
unfaithful woman like you

648
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,210
has no right

649
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,840
to stay in the Zhang family!

650
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,300
Right! Expel her!

651
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,990
Everyone's watching.

652
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,790
You vicious woman,

653
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,920
do you admit to adultery?

654
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,750
Do you admit it?

655
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,070
Do you admit it? Speak up!

656
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,480
Speak!

657
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,160
Speak!

658
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,720
Just admit it.

659
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Yeah, do you admit it?

660
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,270
I admit it.

661
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,270
I admit it's all my fault.

662
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,890
I shouldn't have been born a woman.

663
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,480
If I hadn't, maybe my husband's death

664
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
wouldn't have brought

665
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,160
you bullies to my doorstep!

666
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,040
Watch your mouth!

667
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,130
What did you just say, you vile woman?

668
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,610
You all really think I don't get it?

669
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,410
You act all righteous,

670
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,380
but you just want

671
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,400
to pin a crime on me

672
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,090
and kick me out

673
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,770
so you can steal my house!

674
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,640
How dare you slander us?

675
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,630
You filthy tramp!

676
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,960
I'll tear your mouth apart today!

677
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,110
-Don't!
-Hit her!

678
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,550
Hit her! Hit her!

679
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,440
Back off!

680
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,360
Who are you?

681
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,240
Never seen someone dumping slop before?

682
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
I said back off, but you didn't move.

683
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Serves you right.

684
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,790
All of you ganging up

685
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,050
on one helpless woman—

686
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,590
aren't you afraid of the law?

687
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,110
Don't try to scare us with the law.

688
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,030
Who are you?

689
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
That's

690
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,720
none of your business!

691
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,240
You're assaulting someone in public,

692
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,400
and she's hurt.

693
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,550
If you don't leave,

694
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,750
I'll report this to the government now.

695
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,480
Fine.

696
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,830
You win this time.

697
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,790
But you two

698
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,160
can't protect her forever.

699
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,960
Just you wait.

700
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Just you wait!

701
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,520
Are you okay?

702
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,400
As your neighbor,

703
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,590
I've heard a bit

704
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,850
about your situation.

705
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,040
Forgive me for saying this,

706
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,200
but your husband

707
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,230
was an alcoholic.

708
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,480
He was rude

709
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,400
and violent.

710
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,480
His death

711
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,330
must be a relief for you.

712
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,540
Maybe you should report this.

713
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,920
You're all alone.

714
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,800
If they come back,

715
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,930
what will you do?

716
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,930
At worst, they'll beat me to death.

717
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,720
Don't say such things.

718
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,790
Is there no justice left in this world?

719
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,320
You can't be afraid of them.

720
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,310
The more fear you show,

721
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,840
the more they'll bully you.

722
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,960
The Sanhuai Lane

723
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,160
really is cursed.

724
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,400
Banxia,

725
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
do you remember the man

726
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
who fell to his death the other day?

727
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,960
He lived here too.

728
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,170
You knew him?

729
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,750
No.

730
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,810
I live right there.

731
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,310
We're neighbors from now on.

732
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,710
If you need any help,

733
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,680
just call me.

734
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,650
Thank you.

735
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,240
Let's go.

736
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,300
You again!

737
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,960
I was about to look for you,

738
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,489
yet you showed up yourself.

739
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,290
Where did you get this?

740
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,120
Do you really know Man Ying?

741
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,030
Yeah, I do.

742
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,090
Untie the rope,

743
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,370
kneel down,

744
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,770
and kowtow three times to me.

745
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,430
Then I'll take you to find him.

746
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,350
You don't know him.

747
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,950
Xuanye.

748
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,480
Xuanye…

749
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,230
Then do you know Xuanye?

750
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,200
You do.

751
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,070
Then take me to see him.

752
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,760
No way!

753
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,640
Then I'll have no choice but to kill you.

754
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,980
I don't think you will.

755
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,980
I don't have much patience.

756
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,230
Three.

757
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,190
Two.

758
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,860
I'll take you.

759
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,260
I can take you to him,

760
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,350
but after you see him,

761
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,480
you have to let me go.

762
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,070
Sure.

763
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,280
Once I see him, I'll let you go.

764
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,440
Physician Jiu isn't here.

765
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,700
Come back another day.

766
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
He's been gone for three days.

767
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,490
Think carefully again.

768
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,090
Did he say where he was going?

769
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,250
Where have you been all these days?

770
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,150
Banxia?

771
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,270
It really is you!

772
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:40,960
Don't you recognize me?

773
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,890
It's me, Li Xian.

774
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,030
Xuanye.

775
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,400
This is Banxia,

776
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,510
my fiancée.

777
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,350
Sir,

778
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,700
madam,

779
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,980
after I heard what happened to you,

780
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,810
I traveled day and night

781
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,470
to get here.

782
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
This is truly wonderful news.

783
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,480
Uncle Duan has returned,

784
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,020
and Aunt Duan has been found.

785
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,320
When my father heard about it,

786
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
he was so happy he drank

787
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,690
three big bowls of wine!

788
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,180
If not for his official duties,

789
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,580
he would've come with me.

790
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
It was a long journey.

791
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,000
Xian,

792
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
you must be tired.

793
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,570
Uncle, you're so kind.

794
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,030
We're all

795
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,490
one family now, aren't we?

796
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,800
Oh, right.

797
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,960
This is Physician Jiu. His name is Xuanye.

798
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,900
He saved my life.

799
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,550
My journey here

800
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,020
was full of danger—

801
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,420
steep mountains,

802
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,520
vicious beasts,

803
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,860
and wolves all around.

804
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,390
I barely made it out alive.

805
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,420
If it hadn't been for Xuanye,

806
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,550
who scared off the wolves

807
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,880
with his mere presence,

808
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,690
this fragile body of mine

809
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,920
would've disappeared

810
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,850
from this world.

811
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,320
Xuanye

812
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,880
is not only kind and righteous

813
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,140
but also clever, wise,

814
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,430
well-read,

815
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,710
and talented.

816
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,190
On our way back,

817
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,990
we talked about

818
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,390
astrology, geography, and local customs.

819
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,390
We never ran out of things to say.

820
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,990
I truly wish we had met earlier.

821
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,330
Xian, you may not know,

822
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,670
but we've known

823
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,540
Physician Jiu for some time now.

824
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,710
He also saved

825
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,840
our whole family.

826
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,360
What a coincidence!

827
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,670
Xuanye,

828
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,760
I told you we were destined to meet.

829
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,020
We should do as I suggested—

830
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,320
follow the ways of the ancients:

831
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,110
drink blood wine

832
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,640
and become sworn brothers.

833
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,600
But he refused.

834
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,310
Thank you, Physician Jiu,

835
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,560
for saving Li Xian.

836
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,850
It's a great kindness

837
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,070
to both the Duan family

838
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,470
and Banxia.

839
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,360
You must be tired

840
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,200
after your long journey.

841
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,440
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

842
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,360
In a few days,

843
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,480
I'll host a banquet at Yanlai Restaurant

844
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,670
and invite you to drink with us.

845
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,570
That's a great idea.

846
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,480
Xuanye,

847
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,230
don't turn us down then.

848
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,480
Okay.

849
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,440
I'll head back now.

850
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,030
Yeah, Banxia,

851
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,230
see Xuanye off for me.

852
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,360
Xuanye,

853
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,610
I'll come to thank you in person soon.

854
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,950
Xuanye.

855
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,760
Xuanye.

856
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,300
As you know,

857
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,880
I've already told my father

858
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,320
about breaking off the engagement,

859
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,030
and he was going to write to the Li family.

860
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,280
I don't know why

861
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,830
Li Xian suddenly showed up.

862
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,830
Are you mad?

863
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,150
I'm not mad.

864
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,960
Really?

865
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,070
Really.

866
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,660
You should go back now.

867
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,400
After all, he came here for you.

868
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,460
Don't be impolite.

869
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,810
But...

870
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm really fine.

871
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,330
Alright then.

872
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
I'll come see you later.

873
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,000
Okay.

874
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,950
Bodhisattva,

875
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,740
I'm here again.

876
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,510
Lv Sanlang is dead too.

877
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,190
I think

878
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,750
you must've heard my prayers

879
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,000
and used your divine powers

880
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,800
to punish the wicked.

881
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,880
My life has been full of sorrow.

882
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,670
I married Zhang Pu at 15.

883
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,150
After we married,

884
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,170
he drank excessively every day

885
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,480
and beat me

886
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,470
and yelled at me over the slightest thing.

887
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,950
After his death,

888
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,130
my neighbor Lv Sanlang

889
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,510
took advantage of my being alone

890
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,430
and often harassed me.

891
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,210
I had no one to turn to,

892
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,200
so I came to you.

893
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,370
But I never thought

894
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,850
you would really listen.

895
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,640
Bodhisattva,

896
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,200
you've already helped me twice.

897
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,480
I thought I could start

898
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,960
a new life,

899
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,270
but why is it still not possible?

900
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,280
Is it that I don't deserve

901
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,940
to have happiness in this life?

902
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,840
If I were a man,

903
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,640
everything would be different, right?

904
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,820
Bodhisattva,

905
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,070
please help me.

906
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,680
This is the last time I'm asking for your help.

907
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,190
Please show mercy.

908
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,960
Being a woman is too painful.

909
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,760
In my next life,

910
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,960
please let me be a man.

911
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,840
Take care.

912
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,070
Banxia.

913
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,660
Are you looking for Xuanye?

914
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Yeah.

915
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,390
He's not here.

916
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,680
Where did he go?

917
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,770
He went fishing.

918
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,160
Then I'll go find him.

919
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,140
Chi Xue.

920
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,580
Lend me your umbrella.

921
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,150
I don't want

922
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,740
my daughter involved in anything

923
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,690
related to demons ever again.

924
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,400
And I don't want her

925
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,590
to marry a demon hunter.

926
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,190
Do it!

927
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,190
Xuanye.

928
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,840
I've been looking for you.

929
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,920
It's going to rain,

930
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,230
so I brought an umbrella

931
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,030
to pick you up.

932
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,170
Let's go home.

933
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,040
Once it starts raining,

934
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,030
it'll be hard to find shelter.

935
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,710
Banxia.

936
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,070
I need to talk to you.

937
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,030
Can't it wait

938
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,420
until we get home?

939
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,360
Let's go home first.

940
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,710
Let's end things here.
