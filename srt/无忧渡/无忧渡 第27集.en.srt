[Episode 27]

3
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,680
I lost.

4
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,920
Your Go skills are impressive.

5
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,450
Better than your father's.

6
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,920
To be honest, Uncle,

7
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,479
when I was at home before,

8
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,740
my father didn't dare to play against me.

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,200
Banxia.

10
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,800
You're back.

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,180
I need your help with something.

12
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,240
What is it? Tell me.

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,590
It's getting into autumn these days.

14
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,910
The weather is turning cooler.

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,170
I want to buy some fabric to make clothes.

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,560
But the East Market is too far.

17
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,890
I don't have a carriage.

18
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,800
That's simple.

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,710
My carriage is right outside.

20
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,430
I'll take you there.

21
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:20,730
Let's go.

22
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,190
Wait.

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,020
Banxia.

24
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,430
It's time for dinner.

25
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,590
If you need to buy something,

26
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,790
go tomorrow instead.

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,500
No, I must go today.

28
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,000
Father, if you think

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,730
you'll have no one to dine with,

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,680
you can go next door to find Physician Jiu.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
After all, he rendered great help to you.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,850
It's good for you to get closer.

33
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,710
That's right.

34
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,840
Xuanye is easygoing.

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,030
He's easy to get along with.

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,240
You're neighbors.

37
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,870
It's good to visit each other often.

38
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,590
Well then...

39
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,329
Okay.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,750
Young Master,

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,430
where do you want to go?

43
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,400
To the East Market.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,560
To buy fabric with Banxia.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Got it.

46
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,960
It's just to buy fabric.

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,560
We don't need others to keep us company, right?

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,800
Can you drive the carriage?

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Yes, I can.

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,070
Then let's go by ourselves.

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,890
Of course, that's fine.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,910
You wait here.

53
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,430
Got it.

54
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,170
Banxia.

55
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,680
Banxia.

56
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,430
Xuanye.

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,690
Are we going or not?

58
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,060
We're leaving now.

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,260
Let's catch up later.

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,150
Xuanye.

61
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,680
Do you know what's going on

62
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,940
with Banxia recently?

63
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,070
She's ignoring me

64
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,360
and doesn't invite me to her house

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,090
to eat delicious food anymore.

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,080
That Mr. Li just now,

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,190
he said before

68
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,750
that he's Banxia's fiancÃ©.

69
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,560
Xuanye,

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
I thought you two

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
were a couple.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,720
Well, if Banxia

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
marries someone else,

74
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,089
does that mean I won't be able to eat

75
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,950
the delicious food she makes anymore?

76
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,150
Stop talking so much.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,050
Get back to work.

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,430
Xuanye,

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,530
are you sure this will work?

80
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,470
We'll only know after we try.

81
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,480
After all, this is just a formula

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,490
guessed by smell.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,130
I'm not certain either.

84
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
These are all the things

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,140
I smelled at his place before.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
Perhaps this is the

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,330
key to this magic spell.

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,430
What kind of magic spell is this?

89
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,430
It's so powerful.

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
I heard before

91
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,760
that some demons

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,820
can use secret techniques

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,580
to share others' five senses.

94
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,070
But as to exchanging five senses

95
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,040
and controlling the other's body like this,

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,970
this is the first time I've seen it.

97
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,270
Let's give it a try.

98
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,800
We can't let him

99
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,270
lead us by the nose anymore.

100
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,730
Chi Xue,

101
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,240
help me set up a formation in a moment.

102
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,570
Okay.

103
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,230
[Heal and Help]

104
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,390
Jia corresponds to Zhen (the East), and Yi corresponds to Li (the South).

105
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,390
All spirits return to their origin.

106
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,240
Go!

107
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,370
Xuanye?

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,360
Who are you?

109
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,050
Who exactly are you?

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,980
If you don't speak,

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,170
don't blame me for being impolite!

112
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,790
You? Seriously?

113
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,490
What are you doing?

114
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,870
Leave now.

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,080
I said leave.

116
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,020
Physician Jiu?

117
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,039
I've set up a formation

118
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,710
and switched identities with him.

119
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,630
Time is limited.

120
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,830
You need to leave now.

121
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
Leave.

122
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,070
Xuanye,

123
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,260
come back quickly.

124
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,730
I can't hold on anymore.

125
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,440
Xuanye.

126
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Chi Xue,

127
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,510
what's wrong?

128
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,870
Xuanye.

129
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,630
That demon refused to say anything.

130
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,150
In the Hundred Demon Catalog,

131
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,150
there's no relevant record either.

132
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,790
However, I can sense that

133
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,440
this demon's cultivation is not shallow.

134
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,610
Is he dead then?

135
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,670
I sealed

136
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,600
the eight major acupoints in his body.

137
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
If he forcibly breaks through,

138
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
he will be severely injured.

139
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Moreover, before I left,

140
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,550
I had set a big fire.

141
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,720
It's unlikely he can escape.

142
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,090
It's still not secure.

143
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,840
You should have killed him with one sword strike.

144
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,900
Our spiritual senses were connected at that time.

145
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,720
If I had killed him,

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,580
I wouldn't have survived either.

147
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,600
There was too little time.

148
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,920
Then why don't we strike while the iron is hot

149
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
and try again?

150
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,450
This magic spell

151
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,260
consumed a lot of energy.

152
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm afraid of being backfired.

153
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,100
Besides, now,

154
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,230
he must be prepared.

155
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,630
If we rashly try again,

156
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,670
it's also possible that

157
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,070
we'll fall into his trap.

158
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,170
I wonder

159
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,530
if Banxia has returned.

160
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,820
Why are you mentioning her again?

161
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,000
Because I'm hungry.

162
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,790
I haven't eaten anything today.

163
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,290
I just confronted that demon for a long time.

164
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm starving.

165
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,890
Aren't steamed buns filling enough?

166
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,150
They don't taste good.

167
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,820
I'm upset.

168
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,300
Where has she gone?

169
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,060
What did she

170
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,820
buy today anyway?

171
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,260
Let me tell you secretly.

172
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,810
She told me not to tell.

173
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,250
She bought hypostasis water.

174
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,510
What does she need hypostasis water for?

175
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,580
She doesn't even know how to use it.

176
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,550
She knows how to use it.

177
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,210
I taught her the incantation.

178
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,880
How could there be any problem with what I taught?

179
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,620
Banxia.

180
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,850
Aren't we supposed to go to the East Market to buy fabric?

181
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,910
Why are we here?

182
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,100
My hunger

183
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,390
is making me feel dizzy.

184
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,550
And if we don't head back soon,

185
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
it'll be dark by the time we get back.

186
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,790
How about

187
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,610
we leave?

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,130
Wait a little longer. A little longer.

189
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,350
Just a little longer.

190
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,170
When my father talked about the arrangements for our marriage,

191
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,120
did he explain

192
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,750
my situation to you clearly?

193
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,810
He told us everything.

194
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Your father said,

195
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,960
you're well-behaved, sensible,

196
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,220
gentle, and virtuous.

197
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,280
Although you're only two years younger than I am,

198
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,200
you've read

199
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,760
just as many books as I have.

200
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,910
He even had our Four Pillars of Destiny compared

201
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,440
and said

202
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,400
the two of us

203
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,950
are very compatible,

204
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,460
a match made in heaven.

205
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,790
He also said

206
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,540
that after we're married,

207
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,670
we'll surely live in harmony

208
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,410
and grow old together.

209
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,980
That's not what I mean.

210
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,630
My left eye...

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,060
You... You mean your hallucination?

212
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,100
Your father mentioned that, too.

213
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,440
Well,

214
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,770
doesn't it bother you?

215
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm not that old-fashioned.

216
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,910
Everyone gets sick

217
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,670
at some point in their life.

218
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,180
This isn't something

219
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,040
we can control.

220
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,270
Of course, I understand

221
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,630
that as a young lady,

222
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,000
you have many burdens.

223
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,290
But don't worry.

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,820
I will take good care of you.

225
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,620
And I will never look down on you.

226
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,890
It's not an illness.

227
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,120
It's not.

228
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,320
Absolutely not.

229
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,630
The things I see are real.

230
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,550
There are really demons in this world.

231
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,330
Think carefully, how can someone

232
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,660
come back from the dead?

233
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,380
My father and the others

234
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,860
were kidnapped by demons.

235
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,720
I chased them all the way from Nanyang to Guangping.

236
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
Although I had help from a master,

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,390
it still took a tremendous effort

238
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,550
to rescue them.

239
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,390
This kind of thing,

240
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,720
if it happens once, it can happen again.

241
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,240
It may happen repeatedly.

242
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,870
If we're married later,

243
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,240
aren't you afraid that one day,

244
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,170
those demons might kidnap you too?

245
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,840
They told me a few days ago

246
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,150
that your condition had greatly improved.

247
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,550
Has it relapsed?

248
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,600
But it doesn't matter.

249
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
My word is my bond.

250
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,270
I'm willing to face this with you.

251
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,320
I won't break off the engagement because of this.

252
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,480
I knew it.

253
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,240
All right.

254
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,480
Here.

255
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,720
Take this.

256
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,780
What are you doing?

257
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,640
The Earth follows the laws.

258
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,080
The essences of Yin and Yang are combined.

259
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,550
Carry out all the laws and principles.

260
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,670
Yin and Yang are just like a mirror.

261
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,480
True forms swiftly appear.

262
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,120
Appear quickly in your real shapes.

263
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,050
Close your eyes.

264
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,850
What... What are you doing?

265
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,270
Banxia,

266
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,380
I... I know I'm a good man.

267
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,200
But...

268
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,200
We can't do this now.

269
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,470
-B-Because...
-Take it.

270
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,700
There should be a certain degree of propriety in the interaction between men and women.

271
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,080
And you haven't officially married into my family yet.

272
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,010
Shut your mouth.

273
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,030
Okay.

274
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,780
Banxia!

275
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,290
Spicy, spicy, so spicy!

276
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,480
Hang in there for a bit. Hang in there for a bit.

277
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,200
Open your eyes, open your eyes, open your eyes.

278
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,750
Look, look, look.

279
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,080
Look there, look there.

280
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,170
Look at what?

281
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,390
Nothing?

282
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,670
What?

283
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,480
The dosage isn't enough.

284
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,050
Wait a moment. Let's try again.

285
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,390
Banxia.

286
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,390
Banxia, I...

287
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,150
Hold this, hold this.

288
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,670
Banxia.

289
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,600
The Earth follows the laws.

290
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,390
I... I don't know

291
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,910
what exactly you're doing.

292
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,390
I don't know

293
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,000
what you're trying to prove either.

294
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,720
But I think

295
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,320
all matters

296
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,150
can be solved

297
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,120
through other ways, right?

298
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,510
Banxia.

299
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,440
-This will work.
-Banxia.

300
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,700
Come on, hang in there.

301
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,750
Help me hold this for a moment.

302
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,080
I can't hold it anymore.

303
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
The effect is too strong!

304
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,200
Hey, you need to open your eyes!

305
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,030
Banxia!

306
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,600
Hey, you have to open your eyes!

307
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Open your eyes, open your eyes!

308
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,360
Open... Open your eyes, open them!

309
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,700
Look, look!

310
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Can you see it now?

311
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,320
Does one have to go through so much

312
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,250
just to enjoy sceneries now a days?

313
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,450
Still can't see it?

314
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,670
What is there?

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,860
I won't give up.

316
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,120
Come on, hold this.

317
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,720
Let's go all out.

318
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,840
We'll succeed in one go.

319
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,480
No, no, no.

320
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,440
I see it.

321
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,720
I see it.

322
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,390
Come on.

323
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,720
Here, here, here, here.

324
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,990
I see it, Banxia!

325
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,630
Banxia!

326
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,870
I see everything!

327
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:37,960
There.

328
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,260
It's there, right?

329
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,930
That's what you want me to see.

330
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,150
It's there.

331
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,150
It's everywhere.

332
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
It's just like...

333
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,120
It worked.

334
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,080
Come on.

335
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,120
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

336
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,630
Hang in there.

337
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,160
Come back. Come back.

338
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
Bear with it. Hang in there.

339
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,700
Come on, come on, look.

340
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,310
Fish.

341
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,339
This is a demon.

342
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,460
It's flying toward me.

343
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,510
My Lady.

344
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,230
[Qingche Hall]

345
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680
My Lady, why are you back so late?

346
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,850
Master and Madam are worried sick.

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,590
Young Master, Young Master.

348
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,070
This...

349
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,960
Ms. Duan,

350
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,200
what happened...

351
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,270
to my young master?

352
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,680
Nothing, he just fainted.

353
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,790
Fainted? This...

354
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,390
Young Master, wake up.

355
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,280
Young Master.

356
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,760
Where did you take him, My Lady?

357
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,360
He's seen quite a sight.

358
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,050
The young master had quite a shock today.

359
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,240
You should take him

360
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
to get some calming medicine later.

361
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,300
You used hypostasis water on him?

362
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,120
You should know

363
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,550
how terrifying demons can be.

364
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,200
Why did you reveal this to him?

365
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,230
Aren't you afraid it might bring trouble?

366
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,980
Then why did you

367
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,410
reveal it to me back then?

368
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,770
That's different.

369
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,550
How is it different?

370
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,130
I can see demons,

371
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,110
but what about him?

372
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,070
He's now going to marry

373
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,530
a woman who can see demons.

374
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,300
Should I keep it from him for the rest of his life?

375
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,070
If a person

376
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,310
doesn't know

377
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,970
what kind of situation he's in

378
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,720
and doesn't understand what he's facing,

379
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,480
how can he make decisions

380
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,740
that follow his heart?

381
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,770
If I kept hiding it from him,

382
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,480
I'd be depriving him of

383
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,940
the right to make a choice.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That wouldn't be fair to him either.

385
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,810
The more thoroughly

386
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,480
you see through some things,

387
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,220
the more you will hurt yourself.

388
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,050
Do you really think

389
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,380
this is for his own good?

390
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,340
What about you?

391
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,790
Do you really think

392
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,120
everything you've done is for my own good?

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
At least I'm better than you.

394
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,440
You didn't even give me

395
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,900
the right to make a choice.

396
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,540
My Lady,

397
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,980
you said something really good just now.

398
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,830
What?

399
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,240
If a person

400
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,640
doesn't know

401
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,440
what kind of situation he's in

402
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,510
and doesn't understand

403
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,510
what he's facing,

404
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,370
he can't make choices

405
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,970
that follow his heart.

406
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,920
What's so good about it?

407
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,670
I think it's quite good.

408
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,860
Mr. Bai,

409
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
you played so well.

410
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,200
It's been a long time since I've heard

411
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,070
such exquisite music.

412
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,030
Have a try?

413
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,090
It's a pity, though.

414
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,350
I haven't played for so long.

415
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,960
My skills are quite rusty.

416
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,070
Besides, I

417
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,550
work all day with my hands,

418
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,640
which are now rough and calloused.

419
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
How can I possibly play the Qin well?

420
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,040
Take another look at your hands.

421
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,070
Are they the same as before?

422
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,520
Give it a try.

423
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,200
Sir.

424
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,870
Have you seen this woman?

425
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,310
I haven't seen her.

426
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,710
Please think carefully.

427
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,040
I really haven't seen her.

428
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,640
Five li ahead

429
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,860
is Shendu City.

430
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,880
If you're looking for someone,

431
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,440
you might want to check the Shendu Government.

432
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
With some money,

433
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,570
you might get what you want to know.

434
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,790
Thank you for your trouble.

435
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,720
You're welcome.

436
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,380
Excuse me,

437
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,490
have you seen this young lady?

438
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,720
Well...

439
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,040
I haven't seen her.

440
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,160
Is this a young lady?

441
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,270
She just dresses

442
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,130
more like a man.

443
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,730
Is that one?

444
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,300
Sima Lingying!

445
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,540
Sima Lingying!

446
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,380
Sima Lingying! What happened?

447
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,640
What's wrong with you?

448
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,880
Demon.

449
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,540
Demon.

450
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,880
Sima Lingying!

451
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,830
My Lady, you're awake.

452
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,550
Li Xian is here again.

453
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,050
He's waiting for you in the front hall.

454
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,160
He's here again?

455
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
He came here

456
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,180
even though he's sick.

457
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,350
His eyes

458
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,550
gaze blankly at everything,

459
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,750
as if he's possessed.

460
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,150
It's quite frightening.

461
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,170
Well,

462
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,720
why do you keep gazing at me?

463
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,350
Yes.

464
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,880
I was reckless yesterday.

465
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,440
But I didn't expect

466
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
you to be so timid.

467
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,080
You fainted right away.

468
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,000
But

469
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,750
I certainly didn't mean any harm.

470
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,460
I just wanted you to see clearly

471
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,310
and not to blindly

472
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,110
get married.

473
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,110
In the future...

474
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,040
In the future...

475
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,780
I will respect you even more, My Lady.

476
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,510
I used to think

477
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,520
that you had hallucination.

478
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,040
Little did I know that I

479
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,100
was the one who was truly beyond cure.

480
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,480
My illness

481
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,200
is ignorance,

482
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,440
arrogance,

483
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,780
and most of all, narrow-mindedness.

484
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,510
Banxia.

485
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,070
Thanks to you,

486
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,240
I now know that in this world,

487
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,070
there are actually demons,

488
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,650
such mysterious creatures.

489
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,740
Aren't you scared?

490
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,040
Of course not.

491
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,850
But you fainted from fright.

492
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,640
I was just overwhelmed with excitement.

493
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,400
To be honest,

494
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,960
after I woke up this morning,

495
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,560
I still couldn't believe it.

496
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
I thought it was all just a dream.

497
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,200
It wasn't until I asked my coachman

498
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,930
that I realized it was all real.

499
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,830
Look, the thing is,

500
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,750
there are many types of demons in this world.

501
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,790
Not all demons

502
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,510
are like the fish demon

503
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,600
we saw yesterday,

504
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,270
which is kind and approachable.

505
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,790
They often transform into human form

506
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,590
and hide among people.

507
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,960
When you're not paying attention,

508
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
they'll skin you alive,

509
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
break your bones,

510
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,710
gnaw on your flesh, and suck your blood.

511
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,000
Really?

512
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,520
So you're saying

513
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,920
those demons in storybooks,

514
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,070
like fox demons, water demons, and painted skin demons,

515
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,800
are all real?

516
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,440
Banxia,

517
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,960
have you seen them before?

518
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,200
Can they really speak like humans?

519
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,260
Are they good at singing and dancing?

520
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,380
Wait a moment.

521
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,750
I've prepared pieces of paper and a brush.

522
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,480
I want to record everything in detail.

523
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,210
I'm going to write a book that is going to be famous around the world.

524
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,930
Sima Lingying.

525
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,440
Sir,

526
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,790
could you drive the carriage more steadily?

527
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,320
Alright.

528
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,680
Hang in there.

529
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,960
Once we reach Guangping,

530
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,820
Xuanye will find a way to save you.

531
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,330
Just hold on, okay?

532
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,910
Youhuang.

533
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,110
Excuse me,

534
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,280
have you seen this woman?

535
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,350
Let me see.

536
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,090
I really don't know.

537
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,200
No.

538
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,450
Thank you for your trouble.

539
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,350
Xuanye,

540
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,310
I followed your advice

541
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,480
and investigated Zhang Pu's wife.

542
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,610
Sure enough, I found something suspicious.

543
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,450
What is it?

544
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,370
Do you remember

545
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,440
that Lv Sanlang, who fell to his death

546
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,740
in front of Xingxian's house several days ago?

547
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,410
Yes.

548
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,480
He was a drunkard and a lecher.

549
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,960
He was even more despicable when drunk.

550
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,360
When Zhang Pu was still alive,

551
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,110
he didn't dare to harass Xingxian.

552
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,440
But after Zhang Pu died,

553
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,070
he became unrestrained.

554
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,600
He often bullied Xingxian.

555
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,410
Who told you this?

556
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,670
The neighbors all know about it.

557
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,720
What a coincidence.

558
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,380
Zhang Pu often beat Xingxian.

559
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,610
In the end, he died mysteriously.

560
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,490
Lv Sanlang molested Xingxian.

561
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,940
He also broke his neck.

562
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,110
In the end, Xingxian

563
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,630
also died inexplicably.

564
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,210
And her body is missing.

565
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,290
Are there any other clues?

566
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,550
No.

567
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,960
Although Zhang Pu and Lv Sanlang

568
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,980
were neighbors,

569
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,240
they weren't close.

570
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
They had no previous interactions.

571
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,350
Is there anything

572
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,400
in common?

573
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,230
For example,

574
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,310
knowing the same people

575
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,510
or frequently visiting the same place.

576
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,510
However, I heard from the neighbors

577
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,030
that they both loved drinking.

578
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,880
They were both regulars at Liushui Pavilion.

579
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,590
Whenever they made some money,

580
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,320
they would go there to spend it.

581
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,700
Banxia,

582
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,720
the flying thing,

583
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,980
what kind of fish is it?

584
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,960
Are there demons

585
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,760
on this street now?

586
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,240
Can you use that potion

587
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,300
on me one more time?

588
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,590
Let me tell you,

589
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,070
I'm definitely going to break off the engagement with you.

590
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,350
I have someone I like.

591
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,640
But that person is not you.

592
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
If you're sensible,

593
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,790
you should cancel the engagement quickly.

594
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,140
We'll both save face.

595
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,720
If you're not sensible,

596
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,440
don't blame me for being ruthless.

597
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,500
Do you understand?

598
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,640
Mr. Bai?

599
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Please wait, Mr. Bai.

600
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,650
I apologize for the intrusion.

601
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,810
My surname is Jiu.

602
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,510
I just heard your enchanting music.

603
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,790
May I ask where you're from?

604
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,030
You

605
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,480
are also knowledgeable about Qin?

606
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,270
Yes.

607
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,200
That piece, "Drunk in the Misty Waves," I played just now

608
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
is ordinary in techniques,

609
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,830
and the artistic conception is hard to express.

610
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,160
I was afraid I didn't handle it well

611
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,960
to lose the farewell sentiment.

612
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,530
I wonder what you think of it

613
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,450
after you heard it just now.

614
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,680
It's excellent.

615
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,510
The feeling of parting with a friend

616
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,370
was fully expressed in the music.

617
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,880
You can't even tell the difference

618
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,350
between "Evening Fishing Ballad" and "Drunk in the Misty Waves."

619
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,030
You must rarely listen to such music,

620
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,960
or perhaps you don't understand music theory at all.

621
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,170
What exactly are your intentions?

622
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,150
You might as well speak plainly.

623
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,880
Mr. Bai.

624
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,910
If there's nothing else,

625
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,330
I'll take my leave.

626
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,440
Xuanye.

627
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,830
Xuanye, where are you going?

628
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,260
You know what he is.

629
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,980
I suspect he's a demon.

630
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,110
Since you don't want

631
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,370
to tell me what you saw,

632
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,440
I'll have to go confirm it myself.

633
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,640
After you confirm it,

634
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,120
what do you plan to do?

635
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,720
That's my business.

636
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,510
He didn't do anything.

637
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,970
Why do you want to kill him?

638
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,060
When did I say

639
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,350
I was going to kill him?

640
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,000
And how do you know

641
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,260
he didn't do anything?

642
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,000
I can't even judge

643
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,550
whether a demon is good or evil.

644
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,840
How can you tell?

645
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,240
Are you two talking about...

646
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,960
You know him?

647
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,550
Take me to see him.

648
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,340
Alright.

649
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,600
Xuanye,

650
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
this is the place.

651
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,200
Mr. Bai excels in playing the Qin,

652
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,330
but he likes to lead a tranquil life,

653
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,510
having an aversion to a lively and bustling environment.

654
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,370
If he's willing to go to Shendu...

655
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,360
Banxia,

656
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,550
isn't this...

657
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,650
Mr. Bai.

658
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,740
These two

659
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,100
are my friends.

660
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,280
Good friends.

661
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,070
They also admire you very much,

662
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,400
so they came specially to visit you today.

663
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,670
I didn't expect

664
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,590
there was a Qin master like you

665
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,480
in Guangping.

666
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm truly ignorant.

667
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,720
I don't socialize much,

668
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,030
so many people don't know me.

669
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,020
Mr. Bai, you're being too modest.

670
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,410
Today, I heard

671
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,570
your heavenly music

672
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,010
and didn't have my fill.

673
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,280
I wonder if I might have the honor

674
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,770
of listening to it again.

675
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,590
I remember you

676
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,760
don't understand music theory.

677
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,690
It's true, I don't,

678
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
but beautiful things

679
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,640
can always be appealing and resonate with people,

680
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,300
can't they?

681
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,600
I go to Liushui Pavilion every month

682
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,750
to play for seven days.

683
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,200
If you want to listen,

684
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,810
why don't you go to Liushui Pavilion?

685
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,600
I want to listen to it now.

686
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,580
Mr. Bai,

687
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,970
I'd like to, too.

688
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,450
Why don't you agree?

689
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,510
Exquisite.

690
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,680
Marvelous.

691
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,110
I can even hear a bit of

692
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,590
feminine grace in it.

693
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,090
It's really an incredible artistry.

694
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,610
Maybe I was mistaken.

695
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:26,760
Indeed.

696
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,630
How could there be so many demons in this world?

697
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,080
You care about him a lot.

698
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,000
No,

699
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,770
I just don't think he seems like a bad person.

700
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,550
And didn't Li Xian also say

701
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,020
that he is

702
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,480
a Qin master who's indifferent to fame and fortune?

703
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,140
Yes, he's an absolute master.

704
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,290
You still don't understand.

705
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,990
What don't I understand?

706
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,030
What I've said all along,

707
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,070
the difference between human beings and demons,

708
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,270
doesn't just refer to the fact that they're two different species.

709
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,310
Their lifespans,

710
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,400
abilities,

711
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
backgrounds, and experiences also differ.

712
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,350
All these determine that

713
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,350
here is different

714
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,370
between human beings and demons.

715
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,000
The evil in the eyes of human beings

716
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
is very likely

717
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,070
to be the most ordinary thing

718
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,510
in the world of demons.

719
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,550
And what human beings despise

720
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,590
is also very likely

721
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,320
to be exactly what demons like.

722
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,400
Therefore,

723
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
the difference in standards for good and evil

724
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,810
determines that

725
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,480
the ultimate outcome for human beings and demons

726
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,540
will be different.

727
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,030
Banxia,

728
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,100
if you don't understand this,

729
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,300
you'll eventually be harmed by demons.

730
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,159
We can't generalize like that, can we?

731
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,070
Necessary restrictions are imposed on the demon clan.

732
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,780
Demons who harm or hurt people

733
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,060
will be expelled from the human world, and their primordial spirits will be taken away.

734
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,590
Is this also generalizing?

735
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,440
What did I do wrong?

736
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,699
I just don't think it needs to go that far.

737
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,690
Can't human beings and demons

738
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,250
coexist peacefully?

739
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,360
What about you?

740
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
Aren't you still keeping Chi Xue

741
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
by your side?

742
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,920
It's different.

743
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,630
Well,

744
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,670
may I interject?

745
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,800
Are you saying Mr. Bai is a demon?

746
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,880
No wonder.

747
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,360
I was always puzzled

748
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,000
about the reason why his music

749
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,360
is so captivating

750
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,450
and unique.

751
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,890
If he's a demon,

752
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,620
then everything makes sense.

753
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,940
Aren't there any exceptions?

754
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,140
Have you forgotten Manniang?

755
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,210
And Chi Wangchuan?

756
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,550
Have you forgotten what the Dream Demon did

757
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,280
to make your parents

758
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,760
be separated for over a decade against their will,

759
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,840
which led to the fact that they almost couldn't meet in the end?

760
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
Can you forgive all of these?

761
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,550
There's something

762
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,080
I'm not sure if I should ask.

763
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,320
Banxia,

764
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,960
you told me before

765
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,710
that you wanted to break off our engagement

766
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,440
because you

767
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,700
have someone you like.

768
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,880
Is that person

769
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,190
Xuanye?

770
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
It really is, huh?

771
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,710
Well, I

772
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,730
certainly have a good eye for people.

773
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,730
Xuanye, you see,

774
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,150
I admire you so much,

775
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,530
and my fiancÃ©e

776
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,870
is also so fond of you.

777
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,600
Your charm

778
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,590
is indeed evident to all.

779
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,900
The two of us are truly destined to meet,

780
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,460
Xuanye.

781
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,670
We should've become

782
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,600
sworn brothers.

783
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,110
But you didn't listen to what I said before.

784
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,260
What nonsense are you talking about?

785
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,030
Who... Who is your fiancÃ©e?

786
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,980
You should talk less.

787
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,840
Why is she angry?

788
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,990
In principle,

789
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,470
I should be the angry one.

790
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,960
Xuanye.

791
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,710
Xuanye.

792
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,590
I'm not really angry.

793
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,400
Xuanye.

794
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,640
Xuanye, wait for me.

795
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,730
Mr. Bai.

796
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,190
He seems to be from the government.

797
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,520
He came to find me before

798
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,840
to ask about the matter regarding Zhang Pu.

799
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,700
The government

800
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,440
doesn't have such a master.

801
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,110
Master?

802
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,590
I'm afraid he has already seen through

803
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,510
my background.

804
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,710
What should we do now?

805
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,710
We don't need to fear him on normal days,

806
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,710
but if he connects

807
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,390
these recent cases together,

808
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
there might be some trouble.

809
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,400
Well,

810
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,430
for the next days,

811
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,320
you go to Liushui Pavilion to play in my place.

812
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,030
Me?

813
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,780
They probably

814
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,040
won't let it go easily.

815
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,030
They'll keep watching us for a while longer.

816
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,000
When the time comes, I'll use spiritual power

817
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,510
to make you look more like me.

818
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,000
But the magic spell can only last for two hours.

819
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,200
You're a human being.

820
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,140
They can't do anything to you.

821
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:34,950
[Ganshan Clinic]

822
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,880
Xuanye!

823
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,030
Xuanye!

824
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,150
What's up?

825
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,000
As you said,

826
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,320
I found Sima Lingying

827
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,190
near Shendu.

828
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,210
Please save her.

829
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,030
When I encountered her

830
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,230
on the official road,

831
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,360
she fainted.

832
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,760
She mentioned there was a demon.

833
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
How is her condition now?

834
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,770
You go out first.

835
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,230
Chi Xue,

836
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,370
you go out first.

837
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,390
You both go out first.

838
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,990
Including me?

839
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,800
Both of you.

840
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,070
Close the door.

841
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,460
Alright,

842
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,490
stop pretending like that.

843
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
You're really something, Physician Jiu.

844
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,820
How did you see through it?

845
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,960
People involved in a situation are often blind to its true nature.

846
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,280
This little trick of yours

847
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,740
can only work on Youhuang.

848
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,110
Tell me,

849
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,730
how were you captured by the demon?

850
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,420
I want to know the details.

851
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,080
That day, I was in Shendu

852
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,340
going out on business.

853
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,660
I happened to run into a demon

854
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,520
who was in conflict with someone.

855
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,370
His actions were ruthless,

856
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,010
clearly beyond human capability at a glance.

857
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,530
I...

858
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,120
I'm a bit thirsty.

859
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,010
Could you pour me a glass of water?

860
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,370
What happened?

861
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,030
Xuanye said she was trapped by a demon

862
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,950
near Shendu,

863
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,510
so I headed towards Shendu,

864
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,910
searching along the way.

865
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,420
Who knew that before entering the city,

866
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,230
I found her fainted

867
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,030
on the official road in Xiang County's territory?

868
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,020
You were near Shendu.

869
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,400
Why did you come all the way to Guangping?

870
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,220
To deal with matters involving demons,

871
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,710
I must certainly find Xuanye.

872
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,150
Ordinary clinics can't deal with these matters.

873
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,690
Moreover,

874
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,070
if I had sent her back to Shendu

875
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,590
and that demon had come after her,

876
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,720
how would I be supposed to deal with it?

877
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,670
Right.

878
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,710
I didn't realize

879
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,170
you were so thoughtful.

880
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,000
Am I?

881
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,720
I used the insect oil Youhuang gave me.

882
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,870
I intended to lure the demon away

883
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,880
and capture it in one fell swoop.

884
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,810
But in the end...

885
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,840
It turned out as you saw.

886
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,750
I underestimated it.

887
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,610
What happened next?

888
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,400
Later, he recognized the insect oil.

889
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,000
So he guessed that I knew you.

890
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,090
He then tried every possible way

891
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,290
to force me to reveal your whereabouts.

892
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,840
He's after you.

893
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,920
I've brought trouble upon you.

894
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,550
I'm sorry.

895
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,280
What do you mean by trouble?

896
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,480
You saved my life.

897
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,490
Besides,

898
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,720
didn't you also save Youhuang's life?

899
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,770
I'll resolve this matter as soon as possible.

900
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,470
But you must be very careful.

901
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,190
That demon is powerful.

902
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,560
He's difficult to deal with.

903
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,030
I know.

904
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,340
I know you're used to being alone,

905
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
but there are some things

906
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,180
you shouldn't try to handle all by yourself.

907
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,580
If you can't handle this,

908
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,360
I can ask people from the government office

909
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,000
to help.

910
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,360
I appreciate your kindness,

911
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,280
but that won't be necessary.

912
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,840
Alright.

913
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,540
Given what you said,

914
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,800
you must have acknowledged

915
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,840
this favor.

916
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,770
So, can you help me?

917
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,710
Come in.

918
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,000
How is she?

919
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,550
She was poisoned by demon poison.

920
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,040
She needs someone with strong Yang energy

921
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,790
to take care of her closely for 21 days.

922
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,630
Only then can the poison be neutralized.

923
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,590
It's best not to leave her side at all,

924
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,450
whether you eat, drink, or sleep.

925
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,860
I have to be with her even when I sleep?

926
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,080
Is there such poison?

927
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,440
Yes, indeed.

928
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,190
I only learned about it

929
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,360
after I met her.

930
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,150
Aren't there other ways

931
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,900
to neutralize the poison?

932
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,840
No, there aren't.

933
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,400
It's not convenient to take care of her

934
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,360
in my place.

935
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,950
You should take her home.

936
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,480
Me?

937
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,760
Didn't I tell you?

938
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,210
It's not convenient to take care of her

939
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,940
in my place.

940
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,960
Come on.

941
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,230
Thank you.

942
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,030
Can I really do it?

943
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,570
If you don't try,

944
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,330
how can you know it's not possible?

945
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,790
Remember,

946
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,000
the magic spell can only last for two hours.

947
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,800
Be careful in everything you do.

948
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,160
Mr. Bai,

949
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,840
you've come early today.

950
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,660
Hello, Sir.

951
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:12,800
Please.

952
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,510
Mr. Bai's Qin skills are truly amazing.

953
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,030
They make people feel as if they are in a fairyland

954
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,800
and completely immersed in the music.

955
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,230
Great!

956
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,000
Great!

957
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,960
Great! Great! Great!
