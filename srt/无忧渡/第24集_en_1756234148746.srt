Banxia.

4
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,450
Have some fish.

5
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,720
I've removed all the bones for you.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Chief Constable Chu,

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,300
you didn't have to do that.

8
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,430
I'd like to help.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,650
The fish here tastes great.

10
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,180
Try some.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,560
I doubted if you knew how to get the bones out,

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,960
so I removed them for you.

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
What do you think?

14
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,100
Have some more.

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,960
This distilled liquor

16
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,750
is very strong.

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,750
Stay away from it.

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,010
Here,

19
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,390
have some tea.

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm good, Chief Constable Chu.

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,540
I-I can manage on my own.

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,270
You got choked. Just take a sip.

23
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,980
I'm really good.

24
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,850
This is the one, right?

25
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,250
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,340
What's wrong, Banxia?

27
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,240
I just choked on the liquor.

28
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,720
Drink some tea then.

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,750
Thank you.

30
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,990
The liquor tastes great.

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
Li likes drinking too.

32
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,560
He didn't join us today.

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,280
What a pity.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
He took a leave and went back to his hometown.

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,280
A leave?

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Why?

37
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,000
A brother of his is getting married.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,600
He has to be there to help out.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,150
Li has never been married.

40
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,910
What could he

41
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,040
possibly help with?

42
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,670
His brother already held an engagement ceremony.

43
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,140
There is only one step left undone

44
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,960
before the wedding.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,710
The Li family is quite influential there.

46
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,000
The elder members will handle the worshipping of ancestors.

49
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,170
and welcome the bride.

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,540
How hard could that be?

51
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,310
You know so much about it.

52
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,560
After all, I have

53
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,310
been through the same thing.

54
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,250
Seriously?

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,430
You've never been married.

56
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,470
Of course I have.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,490
That was just a joke.

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,640
I've never been married.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,980
Careful. Careful.

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,460
I'm telling you...

61
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,570
Watch your tongue.

Mr. Yan?

00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,390
You can leave now.

65
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,710
No need to wait for me.

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,890
Let's go.

67
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,600
Shall I wait for you downstairs?

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,510
No, I'm all good.

69
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,710
You should get going.

70
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,470
Tingzhou,

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
take Banxia home.

72
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,720
Okay.

Slow down. Slow down.

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,190
You gotta be careful these days.

77
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,800
Banxia?

78
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,210
Didn't I tell you to go?

79
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,830
Why are you waiting here?

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,720
I don't have much

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,850
to do at home anyway.

82
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,400
What are you staring at?

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,940
I have such good taste.

84
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,510
For clothes, I meant.

85
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,240
You were right.

86
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,240
It would fit with a full stomach.

87
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,240
I bought you clothes as a gift.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't you think you should

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
give me something in return?

90
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,480
Well,

what do you want?

Let's go.

93
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,800
Come with me.

Here we are.

95
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,190
Get some rest.

I'll come to see you off tomorrow.

straight,

101
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,290
it's unnecessary for us

102
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,090
to meet again.

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,530
What do you mean?

104

I don't know what

105
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,390
is making you do this.

106
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,870
But when you think it through,

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,360
you can come to the capital city for me.

Thank you.

Enjoy.

113
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,410
So delicious.

114
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,050
Get a bite.

115
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,380
If you want me to eat it,

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,690
why didn't you just buy two bowls of it?

117
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,170
One is enough for both of us.

118
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,060
You're not eating it.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,320
Do you hate me or what?

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,830
No, I don't.

121
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,330
Come on,

122
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,190
try some.

It's good, isn't it?

124
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes.

125
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,470
You eat it.

126
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
It's all yours.

It's quite late now.

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,740
I'll take you home after you finish this bowl.

129
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,260
So soon?

130
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm not done wandering around yet.

131
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,660
You don't want

132
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,030
your parents to get worried, do you?

133
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,000
I already told them

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,360
this would take a while when I left.

135
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
Don't you worry about it.

136
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,680
How are they doing lately?

137
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,320
Is the medicine working?

138
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,310
My father is much better now.

139
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
But my mother

140
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,990
still doesn't feel well.

141
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,159
She's having dreams very often,

142
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,049
and can't sleep without the calming fragrance.

143
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,390
But the frequent use of it

144
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,590
is harmful to health.

145
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:42,960
Well,

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,440
and sleep-aiding prescription

149
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,570
for you to take home.

150
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay.

151
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you remember

152
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,270
the wish we made here?

153
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,000
Now it has come true.

154
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,410
My parents have come back safely.

155
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,330
However, for some reason,

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,790
my mother doesn't seem to like me.

157
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,750
She always avoids me.

158
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,600
She speaks too politely to me.

159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,910
She hates it when I touch her.

160
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,380
Xuanye,

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
tell me.

162
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,870
Am I not being

163
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,200
a good enough daughter?

164
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
I've grown up,

165
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,360
but not in the way

166
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,670
she likes.

167
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,730
Is that why she's acting this way?

168
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,840
You know

169
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,200
what your mother has been through.

170
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,680
She was a Guanyin Bodhisattva statue for over 10 years.

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,210
She couldn't speak or move.

172
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,520
Clear though her mind was, she was controlled by others.

173
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,480
Do you know how

174
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,710
despairing that was?

175
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,960
She didn't commit suicide,

00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,630
go insane,

177
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,560
or become completely different.

178
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,870
It wasn't easy for her.

179
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,360
The effects

180
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,990
of past experiences sometimes linger on.

181
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
I've seen many people

182
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,740
who couldn't

183
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,270
reconcile with their past.

184
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,720
Your mother

185
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
is doing a good enough job

186
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
coming this far.

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,220
You should be patient,

188
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,230
and spend more time with her.

189
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
You're right.

190
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,870
I was not being considerate enough.

191
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,880
You know so many things.

192
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,180
I do, only when I'm compared with you.

193
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,080
That was scary.

194
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,080
I don't think I can

195
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,010
enjoy fireworks shows these days.

196
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,050
We're already back to reality.

197
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,510
Everything in the painting

198
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,770
was untrue, wasn't it?

199
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,690
But it was still frightening.

200
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,870
Banxia,

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,530
have you ever thought about

202
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,210
what your life would be like

203
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,080
if you couldn't see demons?

204
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,700
Very different, I assume.

205
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,080
My life would be happier.

206
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,390
My father would still be an official,

207
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,250
and my mother wouldn't have left.

208
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,320
We could've been

209
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
closer to each other.

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,270
I might've received education,

211
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,690
learned to ride horses,

212
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,620
or even studied martial arts.

213
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,360
Aren't you describing He Quelian's life?

214
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,710
Her life seems pretty good, doesn't it?

215
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,370
You like that kind of life?

216
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,620
Not really.

217
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,060
Why?

218
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,630
Because

219
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,630
I wouldn't have met you in that case.

220
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,630
Well,

221
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,030
Xuanye,

222
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,080
you said everything in the painting

223
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,060
was untrue.

224
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,460
Does that mean what you said to me

225
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,420
was also untrue?

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,610
What did I say to you?

227
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,410
Have you forgotten it?

228
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,870
How could you forget

229
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,320
something that important?

230
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,480
That day, you told me

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,600
that you liked me.

232
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,080
I remember it vividly

233
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,550
though you don't!

234
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,150
It happened in

235
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,550
a similar night to this.

236
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,960
There were many stars.

237
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,090
The moon was hidden.

238
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,480
Then, the moment

239
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,860
the fireworks showed up,

240
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,630
you told me

241
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,120
that you liked me.

242
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,630
You said

243
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,000
you had kept

244
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,400
refusing me

245
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,270
because you didn't think

246
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,840
we were a good match for each other.

247
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,270
You said

248
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,960
you lived

249
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
a dangerous life as a demon hunter...

250
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,890
Why are you bringing this up again?

251
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,480
It's not fair to say that, is it?

252
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,920
When I last asked you about that,

253
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,980
Chief Constable Chu

254
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,180
interrupted us.

255
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,820
You didn't give me an answer.

256
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,240
Did I not give you an answer?

257
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Did you give me an answer?

258
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
It's late.

259
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,960
Maybe we should go.

260
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,480
No!

261
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,750
We have to

262
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,150
make things clear today.

263
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,050
Must I

264
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,580
spell everything out?

265
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,870
Of course.

266
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,870
It's an important issue.

267
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,330
It must be stated clearly.

268
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,790
You can't just

269
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,180
patronize me, right?

270
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,670
You must

271
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,870
give me an answer now.

272
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,270
Will you accept

273
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,360
me or not?

274
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,550
Do you like me?

275
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you want to be with me?

276
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,790
If I can't get an answer today,

277
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,270
I...

278
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,150
♫When you're in love, you wish this love could last forever♫

279
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,490
♫Leaning in close to whisper softly♫

280
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,080
♫I miss you♫

281
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,190
♫On every moonlit night♫

282
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,570
♫Tenderness ties us together♫

283
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,560
♫Let me take your hand and keep our promise♫

284
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,390
Now...

285
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,060
♫You shake my soul and pull at my heartstrings♫

286
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
Have I made things clear yet?

287
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,520
♫If I think this world is beautiful♫

288
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,270
♫It's partly because of the moon♫

289
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,880
♫And mostly because I met you♫

290
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,280
Let's go.

♫When life gets hard♫

292
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,390

♫This lingering love♫

♫Is a treasure we both cherish♫

♫When I turn around, you're there♫

♫Right by my side♫

297
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,910
Dad.

298
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,320
It's quite late.

299
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,670
Why are you standing here?

300
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,240
I couldn't sleep anyway.

301
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,320
Thank you for taking my daughter home.

302
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,900
Uncle,

303
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,230
you're very welcome.

304
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,820
Physician Jiu,

305
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,840
I'd like to

306
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,270
invite you over for a gathering some time.

307
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,130
My wife and I will treat you to wine

308
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,730
as a gesture of gratitude.

309
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,760
Uncle, it's very kind of you.

310
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,790
You've thanked me many times already.

311
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,720
I can't thank you

312
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,050
enough for saving me

313
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,360
and my wife.

314
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,530
Alright.

315
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,960
It's very late now.

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,570
You've shown

317
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,300
enough courtesy to each other.

318
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,030
Xuanye,

319
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,960
since my father has invited you,

320
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,690
you should come over some time.

321
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,630
Okay.

322
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,280
Bye then.

323
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,420
I'll get going now.

324
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,000
Uncle,

325
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,970
goodbye.

326
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,480
Come back in.

327
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:18,960
Banxia,

328
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,240
did you

329
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,650
drink alcohol?

330
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,960
Just a little bit.

331
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,600
Is Mom asleep?

332
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,440
She is weak since she was just rescued.

333
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,150
She is taking a rest in the room.

334
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,750
Oh, right.

335
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,150
What does Physician Jiu like to eat?

336
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,280
What does he not eat?

337
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,670
He likes...

338
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,030
Meat.

339
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,110
We should buy plenty of meat.

340
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,670
Did you eat enough food at the gathering?

341
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,270
Would you

342
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,870
like to eat something now?

343
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm full.

344
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,720
I'm a bit thirsty, though.

345
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:57,910
Dad,

346
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,910
why don't you make some tea with orange peel?

347
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,360
Sure.

348
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,150
Wait for it in your room then.

349
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,910
[Ganshan Clinic]

350
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,760
Big Brother,

351
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,270
we've finally found you.

352
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,000
Big Brother,

353
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,220
you're really here.

354
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,240
Mom,

355
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,750
it's me, Banxia.

356
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,870
Mom, are you asleep?

357
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,770
I think I just saw you. Were you out?

358
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,310
Are you asleep?

359
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,069
Mom,

360
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,569
were you asleep?

361
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,349
Yes.

362
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,630
What's up?

363
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,210
My dress needs sewing.

364
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,109
Can you do me a favor?

365
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,830
Come in.

366
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,270
Okay.

367
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,310
Big Brother.

368
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,040
Big Brother.

369
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,710
No need for this anymore.

370
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,960
What happened

371
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,510
in the painting was just a dream.

372
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,440
You don't need to call me Big Brother anymore.

373
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,480
Well, we'll call you

374
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,020
Physician Jiu then.

375
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,510
Okay.

376
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,720
We're here

377
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,330
to deliver a letter to you

378
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,460
for the owner of the Sky Cavern.

379
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,200
Xuanye,

380
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,920
the mess caused by the Enlightenment Bookstore

381
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,050
has been cleaned up.

382
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,400
The other people who were brought

383
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,860
into the painting have all gone home safely.

384
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,100
The demon you entrusted to my care

385
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,880
already left yesterday.

386
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,460
Guangping is not far from the Underground City.

387
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,750
We should often visit each other.

388
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
If you encounter difficulties,

389
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,440
just come meet me.

390
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,890
I'll give you as much help as I can.

391
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,220
Thank you.

392
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,310
Let's talk inside.

393
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,640
Mom, you're beautiful.

394
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,140
Where did that come from?

395
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,830
You're really pretty.

396
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,720
Xuanye told me

397
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,950
the time doesn't stop

398
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,150
even in the painting.

399
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,270
Why haven't you changed a bit?

400
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,140
You little flatterer.

401
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,060
I'm not buttering you up.

402
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,030
Mom,

403
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,970
I'm so happy that you're back.

404
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,560
You've been through so much suffering.

405
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,170
I promise I'll be a good girl.

406
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,940
I'll never upset you. I'll always cheer you up.

407
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,150
We'll lead a happy life as a family

408
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,240
and never be parted again.

409
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,070
I went to your room, but you weren't there.

410
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,750
It turns out you're here.

411
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,550
I was asking Mom to fix my dress.

412
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,310
It's done.

413
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,030
Your mom is bad at this.

414
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
You should have

415
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,700
asked me for help instead.

416
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,480
Nonsense.

417
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,680
Mom's much better than you at this.

418
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,600
It's pretty late now.

419
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,440
I've placed the orange peel tea

420
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,270
in your room.

421
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,390
Off you go.

422
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,110
Okay.

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,020
Thank you, Mom.

424
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,710
Goodnight.

425
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,250
How did you raise her?

426
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,590
Why is she

427
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,750
so glib-tongued?

428
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,160
You're apparently

429
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,830
pleased.

430
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,570
Have I not taught her well?

431
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,350
Come on.

432
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,190
Well,

433
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,430
I don't know your names yet.

434
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
I am Xiang Shan.

435
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,900
I am Xiang Feng.

436
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,890
Physician Jiu,

437
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,550
my two brothers and I

438
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,110
may seem rude to you.

439
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,310
In the Underground City,

440
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,650
we must have offended you.

441
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,710
I apologize for that, Physician Jiu.

442
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,520
It's water under the bridge now.

443
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,030
As I recall,

444
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,680
the three of you were always together.

445
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,090
Why did only you two

446
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,610
enter the painting?

447
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,300
Two years ago,

448
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,000
we took on a task

449
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,530
of looking for Lord Xin'an.

450
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,840
We stayed in the Underground City thereafter.

451
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,640
That night,

452
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,070
we heard

453
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,160
that the Lord had visited the Enlightenment Bookstore.

454
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,480
We also found

455
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,560
that bookstore suspicious,

456
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
so we decided to go there at night.

457
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,600
Those people were surprisingly alert.

458
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,550
They noticed us right after we entered the store.

459
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,010
Our youngest brother was killed on the spot,

460
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,520
while we two were sucked into the painting.

461
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,590
Our mistake was

462
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,960
that we overestimated

463
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,920
ourselves.

464
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,480
If you hadn't come to our rescue,

465
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm afraid we would have...

466
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm sorry for your loss.

467
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,410
Physician Jiu,

468
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,460
we'll never forget

469
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,720
that you're our lifesaver.

470
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes.

471
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,550
If you ever need a favor,

472
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,570
we'll do anything we can to help you.

473
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,230
It's very kind of you.

474
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
In the painting,

475
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,290
you also gave me much help.

476
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
Let's say we're even.

477
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,240
It's getting late.

478
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,180
We should probably get going.

479
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,740
It's late.

480
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,310
Why don't you spend the night here

481
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,350
and leave tomorrow?

482
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,350
We need to carry

483
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,440
our brother's coffin back to our hometown.

484
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,030
We can't delay it.

485
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,310
Indeed.

486
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,280
Big Brother,

487
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,380
we're grateful for your help.

488
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,310
I hope

489
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
we will meet again soon.

490
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,130
Big Brother,

491
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,880
see you.

492
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,510
See you.

493
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,270
We'll go there together.

494
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:50,650
Okay.

495
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,950
Ladies, take your pick.

496
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,130
They're all fresh, miss.

497
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,790
All freshly slaughtered this morning.

498
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,590
New arrivals.

499
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,790
It is wrapped for you.

500
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,470
Chickens for sale!

501
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,550
High-quality silkies!

502
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,070
Sir,

503
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,110
what is this?

504
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,340
Look, miss.

505
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,640
It's a specialty of Jiangshan,

506
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,570
named "silkie."

507
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,690
You can fry it or make soup with it.

508
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,720
It's nutritious,

509
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,520
and it helps to replenish blood.

510
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,480
Sounds good.

511
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,750
Shall we buy a silkie

512
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,950
and make soup with it?

513
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:18,880
Okay.

514
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,960
We'll take one.

515
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,400
Got it!

516
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,720
Banxia,

517
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,590
when shall we

518
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,830
invite Physician Jiu over for a meal?

519
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,480
Yeah.

520
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Don't call him Physician Jiu.

521
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
Just address him by his name.

522
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,680
That's inappropriate.

523
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,040
He saved all of us.

524
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,550
We're deeply indebted to him.

525
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,750
We should be respectful and polite to him.

526
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,240
Your reverence

527
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,920
will scare him away.

528
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,270
Why is that?

529
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,240
Are you two

530
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,920
already...

531
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,340
No!

532
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,310
Just don't call him Physician Jiu.

533
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,400
It makes him sound old.

534
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,830
Just call him Xuanye.

535
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,910
Banxia!

536
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,310
Sir,

537
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,110
here you are.

538
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,750
How much?

539
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,680
20 copper coins.

540
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,310
The medicine in Ganshan Clinic

541
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,110
is really not expansive.

542
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,000
Their prices are 20% lower

543
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,640
than those of Changping Clinic.

544
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,240
That's because

545
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,100
nobody buys from Ganshan Clinic.

546
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,270
A case happened there six years ago.

547
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,270
Haven't you heard about it?

548
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,070
Six years ago?

549
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,670
What case?

550
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,880
Listen,

551
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,570
six years ago, a murder

552
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,520
happened there.

553
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,550
Don't you know that?

554
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,070
No.

555
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,300
The whole neighborhood knows about it.

556
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,480
Summon blood with blood.

557
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,140
Summon eyes with eyes.

558
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,170
Summon a life with a life.

559
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,830
Summon a spirit with a spirit.

560
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,160
Black covers the black head.

561
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,510
Cloud conceals the cloud tail.

562
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,170
Demon Ancestors are supreme.

563
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,920
The world is in the primal chaos of heaven and earth.

564
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,640
Go!

565
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,860
I found you.

566
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,030
No wonder Lou Ying couldn't find you.

567
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,850
What is this place?

568
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,900
[Ganshan Clinic]

569
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,790
Xuanye?

570
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,040
Xuanye,

571
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,530
why are you standing here?

572
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,950
Xuanye, are you okay?

573
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,440
Banxia?

574
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
Yes, it's me. What happened?

575
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,780
How are you?

576
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,530
Are you feeling better?

577
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm fine.

578
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,750
Why did you

579
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,750
go outside?

580
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,170
I don't know.

581
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,350
Maybe I had a nightmare.

582
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,910
What's wrong?

583
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
Why are you bleeding?

584
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,290
H-How did you get injured?

585
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,160
A Moon Bug?

586
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,890
Did it bite you?

587
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,740
But why would it hurt you?

588
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,870
Maybe I was sleepwalking,

589
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,240
and somehow offended the bugs in the dream.

590
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,440
Don't talk nonsense.

591
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,480
How long has it been since you fed them?

592
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,410
Are they hungry?

593
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,480
Possibly.

594
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,480
I remember you saying that they like soup made with lamb lungs.

595
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,720
When the morning market opens tomorrow,

596
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,400
I'll go buy some to make soup.

597
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:41,960
Okay.

598
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,480
It'll be a while before this is done.

599
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,030
You don't have to keep watch on it.

600
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,720
It's okay.

601
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,800
I don't have better things to do anyway.

602
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,310
These Moon Bugs must be starving.

603
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,590
That's why they bit you.

604
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,250
I'll make them plenty of soup.

605
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,730
Let me do it.

606
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,380
Come on.

607
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,040
Oh, right.

608
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,370
After I walked you home that night,

609
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,010
did your father say anything unusual to you?

610
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,000
No.

611
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,870
Why do you ask?

612
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,760
No reason.

613
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,930
I was just worried that he might

614
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,000
reprimand you for drinking alcohol.

615
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,750
I only drank a teensy bit.

616
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,070
Plus,

617
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,310
my dad is really nice to me.

618
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,370
He wouldn't say anything harsh to me.

619
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,840
Glad to know.

620
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,720
What's on your mind?

621
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,720
Nothing.

622
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,160
Really?

623
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,440
Banxia,

624
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,560
last night on the street,

625
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,290
was there anything odd

626
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,110
about me when you saw me?

627
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,120
You were wandering alone

628
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,030
on the street at midnight.

629
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,600
Wasn't that odd enough?

630
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,160
Don't worry.

631
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,310
I won't make fun of you

632
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,910
just because you sleepwalk.

633
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,690
You see,

634
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,920
I've memorized every word of the mantra

635
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,200
and the esoteric formula of the lightness skill.

636
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,440
But why don't things go smoothly

637
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,310
when I use it?

638
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,110
That was just a dream.

639
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Are you really taking it seriously?

640
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,470
The martial arts school was untrue.

641
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,100
So were those martial arts skills.

642
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,250
When the rules set by the Dream Demon

643
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,450
don't apply anymore,

644
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,540
everything will collapse on its own.

645
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,720
You didn't become

646
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,320
a martial arts master at all.

647
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,690
People can't achieve much

648
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,840
in martial arts

649
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,110
without constant practice

650
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,550
and training that could

651
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,590
last for years.

652
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,090
It's about accumulation.

653
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,920
It's too good to be true if one can become a master

654
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,520
after having a dream, right?

655
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,440
You want to learn martial arts?

656
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,010
How about this?

657
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,050
If you're not afraid of hardship,

658
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,150
I can teach you some

659
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,590
self-defense techniques.

660
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,670
Can't I learn something else?

661
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,480
I want to be equipped with proper martial skills,

662
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,409
so that I can catch demons with you.

663
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,920
That is very dangerous.

664
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,800
Keeping in good health should be

665
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
your purpose instead.

666
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,370
Don't underestimate me.

667
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,840
What if I'm blessed with huge talent

668
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,880
and a great body

669
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,719
that make me a natural-born martial artist

670
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,320
just like He Quelian?

671
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,870
It's done.

672
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,610
What are you doing?

673
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,820
You think you'd never get burned?

674
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,730
Let me do it.

675
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,440
I used to think of it as a joke

676
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,880
that some drama performers

677
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,490
would mistake their shows for the reality.

678
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,340
But now, I'm acting the same way.

679
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,070
I hope the Moon Bugs will stop their craziness

680
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,430
after eating this.

[Ganshan Clinic]

682
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,370
[Li's Tavern]

683
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,550
You...

684
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,520
Chief,

685
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,760
why did you

686
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,130
get drunk so fast today?

687
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,460
Not only today.

688
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,550
He's been like this every day recently.

689
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,870
He seems distraught.

690
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,630
Chief.

691
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:14,920
Chief,

692
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,720
more liquor?

693
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,680
No, I'm done with it.

694
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,090
I have to go now.

695
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,180
Someone's waiting for me at home.

696
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,400
Who's waiting?

697
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,230
My wife.

698
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,440
You don't really have a wife, do you?

699
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,100
You must've had a dream again.

700
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,360
Miss,

701
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,710
are you shopping for grocery?

702
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,400
The vegetables are very fresh today.

703
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,600
I'll come back later.

704
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,360
Okay.

705
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,840
Hello, miss.

706
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,510
Are your parents with you?

707
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,680
They're resting at home.

708
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,280
This pig was just slaughtered this morning.

709
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,230
The meat is fresh.

710
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,710
Look,

711
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,840
I especially saved

712
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,900
this piece for you.

713
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,480
Isn't that the younger son of the Jiu family?

714
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
What Jiu family?

715
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
There's only one, isn't it?

716
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,010
The owner of Ganshan Clinic, where a murder happened six years ago.

717
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,030
You're right.

718
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,230
He is the younger son of the Jiu family.

719
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,070
He's not just running a clinic now,

720
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,040
but also working for the government.

721
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,480
He solved a big case not long ago,

722
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,600
and was even commended by the governor.

723
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,320
Physician Jiu has excellent medical skills.

724
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,710
He is also an exceptional

725
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,400
osteopath.

726
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,190
Plus, I've noticed

727
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,620
that the prices of the medicinal materials

728
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,480
in his clinic are much lower than those of others.

729
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,280
Guys,

730
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,510
if you need medical help,

731
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,710
just go to his clinic.

732
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,250
Miss,

733
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,610
I'll give you a big discount

734
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,920
on this piece of meat!

735
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,400
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

736
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,400
Why did you

737
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,760
say all that stuff

738
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,690
to those people?

739
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,770
You did good deeds.

740
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,400
Why not let more people know?

741
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,000
You're hunting demons

742
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,730
to protect the local citizens.

743
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,110
It's fine that they don't want to show gratitude.

744
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,920
But they shouldn't have

745
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,980
taken that attitude with you, right?

746
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,110
Sometimes,

747
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,590
you might not care about something,

748
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,450
but others would make stories up.

749
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,880
The situation will only get worse

750
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,030
in this way.

751
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,810
Interpersonal relationships

752
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,470
are all about communication.

753
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,020
Here we are.

754
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,670
For what?

755
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,050
Buying presents for my parents.

756
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,200
Aren't you coming to my home for a meal?

757
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,830
Don't your parents mean for it

758
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,610
to be a gesture of gratitude?

759
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,500
Why would I buy them presents?

760
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,070
Y-You should show them respect

761
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,380
since they're elders.

762
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,000
That is what courtesy is.

763
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,480
What's more,

764
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,710
you and I...

765
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,850
We're...

766
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,960
What's going on between us?

767
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,990
You honestly don't know?

768
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,140
What are you trying to say?

769
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,600
You're just pretending, aren't you?

770
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,950
I'm not pretending.

771
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,410
You are!

772
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,360
Dad, Mom,

773
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,510
Xuanye bought

774
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,960
these medicinal materials for you.

775
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
They provide nutrition

776
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,560
and strengthen your bodies.

777
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,190
He said

778
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,760
that you must be in poor health since you were trapped

779
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,290
in the painting for so long.

780
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,510
Exercise and nutritious food

781
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,400
will help with your recovery.

782
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,460
Thank you, Physician Jiu.

783
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,790
You saved me and my wife

784
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,590
from the painting.

785
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,820
Before we could repay your kindness,

786
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,360
you've brought us so many gifts.

787
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,960
How mortifying.

788
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,330
Please accept my gifts.

789
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,320
I am a demon hunter.

790
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,860
It's my job to catch demons.

791
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,770
You two are elders.

792
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,400
Since this is my first visit,

793
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
I should at least show some respect.

794
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,880
Let's go to eat.

795
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,630
Okay.

796
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,280
Physician Jiu, this way.

797
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,370
Physician Jiu,

798
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,200
we will never forget

799
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,960
how you saved our lives.

800
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,770
It's kind of you to say that, Uncle Duan.

801
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,070
You can just call me Xuanye.

802
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,150
Please stop calling me Physician Jiu.

803
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,030
Yeah.

804
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,880
Unnecessary formality, isn't it?

805
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,670
And you,

806
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,150
make yourself at home.

807
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,300
Come on.

808
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,630
Thank you.

809
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,400
You often

810
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,260
deal with demons.

811
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,070
I suppose it's very dangerous.

812
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,080
Xuanye is not only a demon hunter.

813
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,600
He also owns the nearby clinic.

814
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,330
When he doesn't have to catch demons,

815
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,530
he'd receive patients.

816
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,920
Young though he is,

817
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,880
he's a real master of magic skills.

818
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,440
Most demons

819
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,630
are no match for him.

820
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,120
He can easily catch demons

821
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,600
like cats catching mice.

822
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,690
Silly girl,

823
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,800
what kind of lousy analogy is that?

824
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,000
Anyway, just don't worry

825
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
about your lifesaver.

826
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,590
He's really good.

827
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
We're out of wine.

828
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,160
I'll go get some.

829
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,160
Banxia

830
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,440
is unruly

831
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,320
and undisciplined.

832
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,370
She must've caused trouble to you.

833
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,720
Uncle Duan, Banxia is fine.

834
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,840
Some time later,

835
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,000
after we recover,

836
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,670
we'll go back to Nanyang.

837
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,840
It's time we made arrangements

838
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,190
for Banxia's marriage.

839
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,480
Thanks to you,

840
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,040
we could live to

841
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,300
see Banxia get married.

842
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,630
By the way,

843
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,680
has Banxia told you

844
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,240
about her future marriage?

845
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,630
She is engaged to

846
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,010
my friend's son.

847
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,920
He is a well-educated

848
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,190
and reliable

849
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,230
young man.

850
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,070
As parents,

851
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,390
we wish for nothing but a stable life for Banxia.

852
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,320
We just hope Banxia

853
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,190
can marry a nice guy

854
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,840
and lead a peaceful life.

855
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,630
That's all

856
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,440
we've ever wanted.

857
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:03,470
[Qingche Hall]

858
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,560
When I was away,

859
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,990
what did my dad say to you?

860
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,910
Nothing important.

861
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,790
A new tavern is said

862
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,320
to have opened on the east street.

863
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,060
The raw fish there tastes amazing.

864
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,590
Shall we go there some time?

865
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,800
Sure.

866
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,630
Go back in.

867
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,850
No need to see me off.

868
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,400
Your dad drank a lot of wine.

869
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,330
You should fix him a hangover cure.

870
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,800
I'll do the cooking and bring

871
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,110
some to you then, alright?

872
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,880
No need.

873
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,030
This amount of wine

874
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,360
can't do anything to me.

875
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,060
I'll get going now.

876
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,710
Has Banxia told you about

877
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,930
her future marriage?

878
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,550
She is engaged to

879
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,070
my friend's son.

880
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,030
He is a well-educated

881
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,280
and reliable

882
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,360
young man.

883
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,580
My Lady, you're back.

884
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,840
Banxia!

885
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,180
Come here. Sit with us.

886
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:04,710
Dad,

887
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,400
Mom.

888
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:06,900
Take a seat.

889
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,960
Okay.

890
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,410
Did Physician Jiu leave?

891
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,770
You're quite close to him,

892
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,190
aren't you?

893
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,590
Yes.

894
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,400
Xuanye's father

895
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,880
was also a demon hunter.

896
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,130
On his deathbed, he specifically

897
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,550
told him not to go to the Underground City.

898
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,680
But in order to help me save your lives,

899
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,970
he disobeyed his father's last order.

900
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,930
He treats me very well.

901
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,030
Dad,

902
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,320
have you written to Uncle Li yet?

903
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,880
To cancel the engagement.

904
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,030
Have you forgotten it?

905
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,400
No,

906
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:50,790
I haven't.

907
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,200
How could I forget it?

908
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,720
You told me

909
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,000
that you arranged that marriage for me

910
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,110
to keep me away

911
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,030
from the demons.

912
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,620
Now that you and Mom are both safe,

913
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,710
you don't need to worry about that anymore.

914
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,510
Plus, given my special left eye,

915
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm afraid I'll bring harm

916
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,280
to Uncle Li and Li Xian

917
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
if I marry into their family, right?

918
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,440
Banxia,

919
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,540
that's not the only reason

920
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,220
you're rejecting this marriage, right?

921
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:27,760
Right.

922
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,550
What you're thinking is correct.
