FINALLY

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,360
Although this was a short career,

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,880
my timing was pretty good,

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,460
I'm going to make a

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I'm so drunk.

106
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
What are you doing?

107
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
It's a little cold in the bamboo forest at night.

108
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
You just got sick.

109
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,120
Take off your shoes.

110
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,640
I'll cover you with the quilt.

111
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
No need.

112
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
Let me do it.

113
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,760
You don't know how to take it off.

114
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Put it here.

115
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
You take a good rest.

116
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,160
I'll get you a pot of hot water.

117
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
No need.

118
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
You can wipe your face with hot water.

119
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,720
Have a good rest.

120
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,440
No need.

121
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't sleep.

122
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
Why can't you sleep?

123
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
It's too noisy.

124
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Really.

125
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,480
It's too noisy.

126
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,440
How can you sleep?

127
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Shen Yi.

128
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,560
You drank the white wine?

129
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,440
It's okay.

130
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,160
I drink it every day.

131
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
It's okay.

132
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,040
Okay, it's gone.

133
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,280
What are you looking at?

134
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
Nothing.

135
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,280
Chi Chi, do you have a family?

136
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,320
Yes, I do.

137
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,440
Where are they?

138
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,160
They are Xuanyi.

139
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,160
I mean, like parents, brothers and sisters.

140
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I don't remember.

141
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Why don't you remember?

142
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
But I have memories of Gaishuan Hall.

143
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
I haven't seen other families.

144
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Have you seen Xuanye's family?

145
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
What kind of people are they?

146
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Just like you.

147
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Like me?

148
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Love to talk, love to knock on doors, and good at cooking.

149
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
He must miss them very much.

150
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm coming in.

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Xuanye, are you awake?

152
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Where is Zhi Xue?

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Xuanye.

154
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Where are you?

155
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm going to have breakfast.

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Go to find You Huang.

157
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Xuanye is sick and has a severe fever.

158
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
You Huang.

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
You Huang.

160
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Open the door.

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Xuanye is sick.

162
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Open the door.

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Dr. Jiu is sick?

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Where is You Huang?

165
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
He went back to the rescue team.

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
He left last night.

167
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
What should we do?

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
He is sick.

169
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Dr. Jiu can cure himself.

170
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm wet.

171
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
I can't walk.

172
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Can you help me?

173
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I'm fine.

174
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
I'm fine.

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
I'm fine.

176
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I'm fine.

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
I'm fine.

178
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Can you help me?

179
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Come out.

201
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Help.

202
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Help.

203
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Help.

204
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Help.

205
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Help.

206
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Help.

207
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Help.

208
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Help.

209
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Help.

210
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Help.

211
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Help.

212
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Help.

213
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Help.

214
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Help.

215
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Help.

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Help.

217
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Help.

218
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I'll give you some water.

219
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,760
Only Tang復 mandu can treat me like this

220
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,740
The human per banным not easily

221
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,480
So your heart isn't necessarily

222
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
The blood in your bodywares

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,060
I guess it's a bit faint

224
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,220
Jheon came to see Da Singing

225
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,220
I'll ask the servants to accompany you.

226
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
They are so stupid.

227
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,220
They can't even say a word.

228
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,220
In your eyes, I'm also a stupid person.

229
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,220
I can't speak.

230
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
Wuniang, you...

231
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Do you have anything else to say?

232
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Wuniang, I'm sorry.

233
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,220
I hit you yesterday.

234
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
It's my fault.

235
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,220
But I'm afraid you did something wrong.

236
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Yes.

237
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I had another dream last night.

238
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
I dreamed that we went back to Gui Mapo.

239
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,220
That was a rainy night.

240
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
Wang Qi was blown away by the wind.

241
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
I went to find Wang Qi.

242
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,220
But you tried to stop me from going.

243
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,220
And you went.

244
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,220
It was so hard to find him.

245
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
I couldn't rest assured.

246
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,220
I only found you when I was a child.

247
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,220
But your arms and legs were broken.

248
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,220
You still have Wang Qi in your mouth.

249
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Father.

250
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,220
It's been a long time.

251
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
Yes.

252
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,220
But for me,

253
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,220
it's like yesterday.

254
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,220
Wuniang, you're a good child.

255
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Without you, I wouldn't be able to get to where I am today.

256
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,220
No matter what others say, I know what I'm doing.

257
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,220
We did something great together.

258
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
I've decided.

259
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Let's close this inn.

260
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
And then we'll leave.

261
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Okay?

262
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Leave?

263
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Yes.

264
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
You don't like it, right?

265
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Then let's leave.

266
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Where are we going?

267
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Wherever you want.

268
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,220
Let's find a place with a lot of mountains and rivers.

269
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Let's live in peace and quiet.

270
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,220
Okay?

271
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,220
Wuniang, what are you laughing at?

272
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Nothing.

273
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,220
I just think your idea is great.

274
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,220
I've been tired of you for a long time.

275
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
That's great.

276
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,220
I'll go pack up my things.

277
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Look.

278
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,220
I made this for you.

279
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Do you like it?

280
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,220
Father's craftsmanship is the best.

281
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,220
That's great. I'll go pack up my things.

282
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,220
You too.

283
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Okay.

284
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Wuniang, they're back.

285
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Wuniang.

286
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
You're awake.

287
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
It's still a little hot.

288
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
I'm fine.

289
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Drink some water.

290
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
I just finished it.

291
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,220
By the way, did you return the waistband to Guangping City?

292
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
I know.

293
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,220
His people were killed.

294
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
We all think it was someone in the inn who did it.

295
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
He will go back and get the people.

296
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,220
It's a demon.

297
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,220
If it's a demon, who is his opponent?

298
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
I gave him something to protect himself from.

299
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,220
It won't be dangerous.

300
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Lie down and rest.

301
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Banxia, I'll take you away when I'm better.

302
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,220
You've taken care of me for so long.

303
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
You must have a hard time.

304
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
Thank you.

305
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,220
Why are we talking about this?

306
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,220
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Who is it?

308
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Who is it?

309
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
Who is it?

310
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
The more white your face is, the more red your mouth is.

311
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
The whiter the better.

312
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,220
Everyone has a change of heart.

313
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
I like it.

314
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Me too.

315
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Wu Niang.

316
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:13,220
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

317
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Eight.

318
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Eight.

319
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Shun Yi.

320
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
This...

321
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Shun Yi.

322
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
Shun Yi.

323
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Wu Niang.

324
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
Wu Niang.

325
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
Sister.

326
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
You're awake.

327
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Head.

328
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,220
You're all awake.

329
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Wu Niang.

330
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
What are you doing?

331
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Why are you tying everyone up here?

332
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
What are you doing?

333
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Why are you tying everyone up here?

334
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
Sister.

335
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Don't you know why?

336
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
What's going on?

337
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Let us go.

338
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Let us go.

339
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Officer Dong Tian.

340
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
What kind of trick is your good daughter playing?

341
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
How would I know?

342
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Wu Niang.

343
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
What are you doing?

344
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Why are you tying everyone up here?

345
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,220
Hurry up. Put them down.

346
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
Thank you for your appreciation.

347
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,220
Wu Niang.

348
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,220
This is a good thing.

349
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Maybe everyone doesn't know yet.

350
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
Today is my birthday.

351
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,220
I heard that

352
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
on your birthday,

353
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
you have to have a friend to celebrate.

354
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
That's a good thing.

355
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Wu Niang is very poor.

356
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,220
Only my father and his family are here.

357
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
So I invited everyone

358
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,220
to celebrate with me.

359
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Please don't blame me.

360
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,220
I don't remember

361
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,220
how old I am.

362
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
I don't remember

363
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
when my birthday is.

364
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Is it the day I was created

365
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,220
or the day I got my spiritual wisdom?

366
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
But it doesn't matter.

367
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
From today on,

368
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,220
I will be like everyone else.

369
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,220
I will be like everyone else.

370
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,220
I will be like everyone else.

371
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,220
I will be like everyone else.

372
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
I will be like everyone else.

373
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
I will be like everyone else.

374
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
I will be like everyone else.

375
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Today is the ninth of July.

376
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
The star of heaven is in your life.

377
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,220
You will have everything you want.

378
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Father.

379
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
I have a good day.

380
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
What do you think?

381
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
Good.

382
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
By the way,

383
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,220
I prepared a birthday meal.

384
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
A guest taught me

385
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
to eat longevity noodles

386
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,220
on my birthday.

387
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,220
It's not tasty.

388
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
I can't swallow it.

389
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Father.

390
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Can't all people

391
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,220
eat?

392
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Why can't I?

393
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
It's okay.

394
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
I won't eat it.

395
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Today is my birthday.

396
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Do you have a gift?

397
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
Who wants to celebrate your birthday?

398
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
I am a official in Guangping.

399
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
It's a big crime to be a official.

400
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Li.

401
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,220
Little girl.

402
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Today, it happened suddenly.

403
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
We didn't prepare a gift for you.

404
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
We were rude.

405
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
How about this?

406
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Let everyone go.

407
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
We will buy you a gift.

408
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
This official

409
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
is so bad.

410
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
He even lied to the children.

411
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
If I let you go,

412
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
you will lose your job.

413
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,220
Where do you want me to go?

414
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
How about this?

415
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,220
I want to tell you a story.

416
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
You tell me a story.

417
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
I will tell you everything.

418
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
I will tell you everything.

419
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
I will tell you everything.

420
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
I will give you everything as a gift.

421
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
You crazy woman.

422
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
Don't touch her.

423
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
I will tell you.

424
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
Okay.

425
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
I don't

426
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
know how to tell a story.

427
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
I will tell you

428
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
what happened in my life.

429
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
I was ordered to kill myself

430
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,220
alone

431
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
to chase the fat man.

432
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
I fell into the mountain

433
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,220
and got lost.

434
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,220
When I woke up,

435
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
the fat man was already awake

436
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
and had no damage.

437
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
But he didn't touch me.

438
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Why?

439
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Because the people around us

440
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
were surrounded by

441
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
the evil wolves.

442
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
We were soldiers

443
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
and thieves.

444
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
But we were trapped in the wolves' group.

445
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,220
We had to fight with our hands.

446
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
We fought with our backs.

447
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,220
We were separated from the wolves

448
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
and survived.

449
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
You were enemies?

450
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
You were partners?

451
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
And then?

452
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
We were discovered by the soldiers.

453
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
I was taken to the old wound.

454
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
He was taken to the dungeon.

455
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,220
And then?

456
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
And then he was beheaded.

457
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
You didn't save him?

458
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Why should I save him?

459
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,220
He was less hurt than you

460
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
and more awake than you.

461
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
If he wanted to kill you,

462
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
he would have saved your life.

463
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Then you owe him.

464
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I am a thief.

465
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
I kill people to pay for their sins.

466
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
How can I be kind to you?

467
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
You are so

468
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
kind.

469
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Then I ask you.

470
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
What should we do with the wolves?

471
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
What about the wolves?

472
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
You killed the wolves.

473
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
What should we do?

474
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,220
Wolves are human.

475
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
They should be killed.

476
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
But

477
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,220
it's just

478
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
a strong set of wolves.

479
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
If the wolves

480
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
are weak to you,

481
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
you kill them.

482
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
If the bandits are weak to you,

483
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220
you kill them.

484
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Then today,

485
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
if you are weak to me,

486
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
you are a fish on the board.

487
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
How can you have so much

488
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
hypocrisy and evil

489
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
ethics?

490
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
What a

491
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
fake story.

492
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
It's so obvious.

493
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Is it not good?

494
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
No.

495
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Hello?

496
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,220
It's your turn.

497
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
I have nothing to tell.

498
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Chief.

499
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
You have nothing to tell?

500
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Or you don't know

501
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
anything?

502
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
You don't know

503
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,220
what love is.

504
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,220
I and Man Niang

505
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
fall in love at first sight.

506
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,220
I thought we would grow old together.

507
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,220
But

508
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
I didn't expect

509
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,220
she was a

510
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
monster who killed people.

511
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
After she died,

512
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
I couldn't

513
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
be selfish.

514
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,220
That's why

515
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
I was confused

516
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,220
by your white-haired man.

517
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
I was left here.

518
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
But in the end,

519
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
she died

520
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
in the hands of that monster.

521
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
Do you understand

522
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
why your wife

523
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
was found and disappeared

524
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
without leaving?

525
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
She risked her life

526
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
for you.

527
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
But you

528
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,220
died in the hands

529
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
of her

530
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,220
and had a fight with your enemy.

531
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
You were in love with her?

532
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
She killed people.

533
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
What about her?

534
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,220
She was just

535
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
a monster.

536
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
I have heard some

537
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,220
stories.

538
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
In the story,

539
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
love and affection

540
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
are different.

541
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
But I know the stories are all fake.

542
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
The real one is

543
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
a couple.

544
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
It's a love story

545
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
about love and affection.

546
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
It's a selfish and false story.

547
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
And you said

548
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
it was all

549
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
fake love and affection.

550
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,220
Dad.

551
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,220
You told me

552
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
that

553
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
you should be

554
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
kind,

555
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
diligent,

556
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
and kind.

557
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Yes.

558
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
But most of the people

559
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,220
I met

560
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
were the same as them.

561
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
They were stupid,

562
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
selfish,

563
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
hypocritical,

564
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,220
and full of lies.

565
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Is this

566
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
what you want me to look like?

567
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
No.

568
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,220
No.

569
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,220
You said

570
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
the desert is lonely.

571
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
You can't stand it alone.

572
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,220
So you made me out of it.

573
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,220
You said I was your daughter.

574
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
So I really

575
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
took you as my father.

576
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
You said

577
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
there was a

578
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
orange tree

579
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,220
in the old house of Guangping City.

580
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,220
Every year,

581
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
I could get a lot of fruits.

582
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
I can't taste them,

583
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
but I really want to see them.

584
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
But, Dad,

585
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
we walked a thousand miles.

586
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Why didn't you

587
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,220
go in before the door?

588
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,380
This time,

589
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:13,260
I instantaneously

590
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,260
made it from the front door.

591
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,260
It's through now.

592
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
I remember

593
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
our movie face-to-face,

594
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Why would a father be afraid of his daughter?

595
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,220
What's wrong with you?

596
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
You say...

597
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,220
You say this is good.

598
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,220
You want to open a hotel here.

599
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,220
What else did you name this place?

600
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
A reunion hotel!

601
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
With who?

602
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,220
You and me?

603
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
This is not a hotel at all.

604
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,220
You locked me in a cage.

605
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
You want to lock me here forever.

606
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
You...

607
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
You're afraid of me.

608
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
Why did you make me out of this?

609
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,220
You think I'm a monster.

610
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,220
Why did you teach me so many manners?

611
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
You...

612
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,220
You treated me like a snake.

613
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
You treated me like a prisoner.

614
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,220
But you're still my daughter.

615
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
You say it's for my own good.

616
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,220
Do you know what I hate the most?

617
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,220
You...

618
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,220
What's wrong with you?

619
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,220
My daughter...

620
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Miss.

621
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I understand.

622
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
You want true love.

623
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,220
You want love.

624
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,220
The more you have, the more you lack.

625
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Not to mention people.

626
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Yes.

627
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,220
Some people are stubborn.

628
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
But they might be brave.

629
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Some people are selfish.

630
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
But they might be smart.

631
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,220
No one is perfect.

632
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
We are like this.

633
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Your father is like this too.

634
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Yes.

635
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,220
You're right.

636
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,220
Sister Duan.

637
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,220
You're really someone I love.

638
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,220
You're better than them.

639
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,220
But...

640
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,220
You're going to die.

641
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
I told you.

642
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,220
I have a brother.

643
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,220
He was like me.

644
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,220
He was very unhappy being here.

645
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,220
But he found a way.

646
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,220
He found someone he loved.

647
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
He pretended to be the other person.

648
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,220
And he came home for the other person.

649
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,220
My brother has been gone for a long time.

650
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,220
I don't know if the new family likes him.

651
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,220
Sister Duan.

652
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I've been waiting for a long time.

653
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,220
I really like you.

654
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,220
I like your appearance.

655
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,220
I like your personality.

656
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
Don't worry.

657
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,220
I'll take care of your family.

658
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,220
I believe your family will like me.

659
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:39,220
I'll do everything you want to do.

660
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
You're crazy.

661
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Get out.

662
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,220
Is that enough?

663
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
Manager Feng Tian.

664
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Do you know what kind of person your daughter is?

665
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,220
No.

666
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
You're not sick.

667
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,220
You didn't drink that wine.

668
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,220
You've been acting.

669
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
You're a fool.

670
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,220
It's a pity that you're not a doctor.

671
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,220
You didn't even learn the etiquette.

672
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,220
But you're still trying to teach me.

673
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
I'm in a good mood today.

674
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,220
I can teach you the principle of one person and two bodies.

675
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,220
That's the evil that can never win.

676
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
What's your name?

677
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm Xu Zi Yuan.

678
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
What's your name?

679
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,220
Shi Qun.

680
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,220
Shi Qun.

681
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,220
Shi Qun.

682
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
Shi Qun.

683
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Shi Qun.

684
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Shi Qun.

685
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
Shi Qun.

686
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Shi Qun.

687
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

688
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

689
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

690
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

691
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

692
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

693
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

694
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

695
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

696
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

697
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

698
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

699
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

700
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

701
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

702
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

703
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

704
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

705
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

706
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

707
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm not sure if I can do it!

708
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
office

709
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,880
You're brought out!

710
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,300
Xun Yi, why are you cutting the net?

711
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,580
You don't know?

712
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,220
Why are you looking at me?

713
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,440
He said toji skinny

714
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,420

Are you stupid?

719
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,140
That was the last fight...

720
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,740
Ipower!

721
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,900

You...

727
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,020
Your wound is quite deep.

728
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,420
Manager, where is the medicine in your shop?

729
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,020
Manager Feng Tian.

730
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,220
Manager.

731
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,620
Forget it. There should be some medicine in the study room. I'll go look for it.

732
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,220
Thank you.

733
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,420
Let's go.

734
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,380
People don't understand oneself.

735
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,660
You could негоciate such a thing.

736
00:38:45,760 --> 00:39:02,280
I that was trying to solve the pentacle puzzle is a

737
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,800

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
Hurry up!

739
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,420
Do I look like you?

740
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
I do, don't I?

741
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
You...

742
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Be quiet.

743
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
I don't want to kill you now.

744
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,420
I heard that...

745
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,420
after a person died,

746
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
their expression was not beautiful anymore.

747
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Today is my birthday.

748
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
Can I make a magic trick for you?

749
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
Look at me.

750
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,420
One,

751
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
two,

752
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,420
three.

753
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Sister Duo.

754
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Sister?

755
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Where are you?

756
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,420
Am I beautiful?

757
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Now,

758
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
we are exactly the same.

759
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,420
I will become you soon.

760
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
When I first saw you,

761
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
I was thinking,

762
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,420
how great it would be if I could become you.

763
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
You are so free,

764
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,420
without any fear,

765
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,420
as if no one could interfere with you,

766
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,420
and force you to do anything.

767
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,420
But...

768
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
I always feel that you are not happy.

769
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,420
Don't talk nonsense.

770
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
I am happy.

771
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,420
Is it so hard to admit that you are not happy?

772
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
You people...

773
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,420
You people are so hypocritical.

774
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
So, sister Duan,

775
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,420
let me replace you.

776
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,420
Let me replace your name,

777
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,420
your identity,

778
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
your life.

779
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
I promise you,

780
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,420
I will live a happier life,

781
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
and live a better life than you.

782
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
I don't want to.

783
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
I don't want to.

784
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
Don't even think about it.

785
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
I don't want to.

786
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
Why don't you want to?

787
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Why don't you want to?

788
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Why does everyone have the right to say no to me?

789
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Wu Niang, don't be like this.

790
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,420
Wu Niang, don't be like that.

791
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
I've heard enough.

792
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
I've heard enough.

793
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Listen to me.

794
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
I want to.

795
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,420
I want everything.

796
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,420
The only thing I don't want now,

797
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
is to not be a phoenix mother anymore.

798
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
Don't be a phoenix mother.

799
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Don't be a doll that has been manipulated.

800
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
In my opinion,

801
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,420
no one has manipulated you.

802
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
You are saying these big,

803
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
obvious things now,

804
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,420
isn't it just standing on your own

805
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
and talking to yourself?

806
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,420
You said your father imprisoned you.

807
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
But what did he do?

808
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
He was just trying to accompany you.

809
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,420
He couldn't even come back from his home.

810
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,420
It's you.

811
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
You killed innocent people with your own hands.

812
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,420
And now you've become a vicious demon.

813
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Do you really think that you can become me

814
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
by killing me?

815
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,420
Even if you leave here with me,

816
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
my family can see through you.

817
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
Do you really think that

818
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
changing your appearance can change your life?

819
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
It's impossible!

820
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,420
Duan Qianxian.

821
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
You are really sharp-tongued.

822
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,420
No wonder I like you more and more.

823
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
If it's really as you wish,

824
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,420
and your family can see through you,

825
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
then I'll send them off to accompany you.

826
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Accompany you!

827
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,420
Duan Qianxian!

828
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,420
Duan Qianxian!

829
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,420
Duan Qianxian!
