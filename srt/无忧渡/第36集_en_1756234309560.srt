00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,039
While

4
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,430
I'm on leave,

5
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,020
I'm taking your mother

6
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,030
to the temple in Yuancheng Mountain for some rest.

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,710
We

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,180
will be back in 10 days.

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,640
Banxia,

10
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,710
why don't you listen to me

11
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,310
and come with us?

12
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:02,890
I'm not going.

13
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,740
It's too boring in the mountains.

14
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,540
Alright then.

15
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,150
Stay home

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
and don't wander off.

17
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,820
Got it.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Just go.

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,650
Alright.

20
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,240
Banxia,

21
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,250
don't cause any trouble.

22
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,920
My Lady, look at that.

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,770
That lantern is so beautiful.

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,870
My Lady,

25
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,960
look at this.

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,410
Look at this.

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,430
A lotus lantern.

28
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,560
It's the latest design.

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
It's so beautiful.

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,750
My Lady, look.

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,150
It's so pretty.

32
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,200
My Lady.

33
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,079
Are you alright, My Lady?

34
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,000
Young lady,

[Mr. Pu]

36
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,040
come and take a look.

37
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,160
See if there's anything you like.

38
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,550
How much is this?

39
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,830
I've already

40
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,480
accepted money from your young lady

41
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
once.

42
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,950
I can't take it again.

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,020
Young lady,

44
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,070
the time has come

45
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,360
for fate to unfold.

46
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,740
Banxia,

47
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,950
I think you've fallen for Xuanye.

48
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,320
Do you know that?

49
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,560
Banxia.

50
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:30,520
♫Who forgot about the ups and downs of that long night's journey?♫

51
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,080

53
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,640
♫Who remembers what's deeply engraved by fate?♫

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,370

♫Waiting for a light that won't go out♫

60
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,070
Will you accept

61

me or not?

62
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,270
Do you like me?

63
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you want to be with me?

64
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,680
If I can't get an answer from you today,

65
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,040

nothing lasts forever.

72
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600

♫Who forgot about the ups and downs of that long night's journey?♫

or even disappear completely.

76
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,800
You just need some time.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,620
After this period,

78
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,880
♫Leaving behind a pouring rain of love and hatred♫

79
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,030

♫A fleeting memory, yet love endures♫

85

and the trip isn't easy.

86
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,130
I won't be coming back.

87
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,040

90
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,070
Xuanye. His name is...

91
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,460
His name is Xuanye.

92
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,680

Why did all of you

101

Time to go.

117
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,000
Sir.

118
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Take me to the Underground City.

119
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,410
Do you have a pass token?

120
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,480
No.

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,060
But I have this.

122
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,630
Here.

123
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,350
This won't do.

124
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,320
To enter the Underground City,

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,550
you need a pass token.

126
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,270
Please help me.

127
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,360
These...

128
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,470
are all yours.

129
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,870
Here.

130
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,720
I'm begging you.

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
Please help me, will you?

132
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,910
Well...

133
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,180
I remember you now.

134
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Xuanye,

135
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
I remember you now.

136
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,030
Xuanye.

137
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,150
It's been a long time

138
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,550
since anyone lived here.

139
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,810
I'll go clean up first.

140
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,200
I'm not leaving.

141
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,300
I'll be right in this room.

142
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,380
It looks quite clean here.

143
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,870
It seems like someone has cleaned it.

144
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,360
Was it you?

145
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,750
I used to

146
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,120
come here to stay occasionally.

147
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,670
Come here to stay occasionally?

148
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,620
So,

149
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,640
how long has it been

150
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,900
since you remembered?

151
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,120
Actually, as soon as I opened my eyes,

152
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,580
I remembered everything.

153
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,950
How is that possible?

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,360
Didn't they say the Real-felicity Sword

155
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,890
makes you forget everything with one strike?

156
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,270
I don't know why.

157
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,790
Maybe something

158
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,190
happened in the process.

159
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,220
What about you?

160
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,700
How did you remember?

161
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
Do you remember

162
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,550
the old man

163
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,210
who sold us the Echo Conch

164
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,610
in the Underground City?

165
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,480
I ran into him again.

166
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,120
He gave me the Echo Conch back,

167
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,810
exactly as it was.

168
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,270
When I heard the sound inside,

169
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,730
I remembered everything.

170
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,600
The Echo Conch?

171
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,390
So, you've been to Guangping before?

172
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,750
Yes, I have.

173
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,630
But didn't they say the Realm Gate

174
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,320
opens once every 12 years?

175
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,600
Our Mystic Panther Clan has a treasure

176
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,710
that allows one clan member

177
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,080
to freely pass through the Realm Gate

178
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,510
and travel to the human world.

179
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,750
Now that the Carefree Herb has withered,

180
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,320
our clan

181
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,750
needs someone

182
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,120
to come to the human world to gather primordial spirits.

183
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,960
So I came out.

184
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,790
Then why

185
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,270
didn't you come to find me?

186
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,200
Actually,

187
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
I've been by your side all along.

188
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,870
When the Real-felicity Sword was drawn,

189
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,070
everything changed.

190
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,120
You all forgot me.

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,750
But you remember everything.

192
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,270
So, Jue Ming beneath the Matchmaking Tree

193
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,130
said he had been there

194
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,010
for many years.

195
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Was this also your doing?

196
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,340
Since I knew in advance

197
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,330
that some evil demons would harm people,

198
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,730
how could I just stand by?

199
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,480
I found

200
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,170
the Moon-Fearing Demon early

201
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,450
and eliminated it.

202
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,270
I also found Manniang early as well.

203
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,930
It's just that

204
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
something happened in the process,

205
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,080
and she escaped.

206
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,020
I thought that with my intervention,

207
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,040
she wouldn't meet your brother.

208
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,670
After Chi Wangchuan died,

209
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,150
Ji Li aged instantly.

210
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,610
She left the Yunmen Dance Troupe.

211
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,710
As for where she went after that,

212
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,720
I don't know.

213
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,300
Constable Yan Li from the government office

214
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,610
didn't die either.

215
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,080
So,

216
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,190
you also went to the Reunion Inn

217
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,390
and met Feng Wuniang?

218
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,720
Yes.

219
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,480
Though I stopped

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,140
Feng Wuniang from doing evil,

221
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,320
I didn't expect that

222
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,240
Qingshan's demon nature wouldn't change.

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,750
After I left,

224
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,880
to save Feng Tian, Nine Lives

225
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,090
traded his lives for money in the city.

226
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,450
He even went to ask my father for help.

227
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,610
When I rushed there,

228
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
I found that Feng Wuniang

229
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,660
had already been killed by Qingshan.

230
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,520
And Qingshan

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,330
was killed by Feng Tian.

232
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,650
What about Nine Lives?

233
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,710
Nine Lives sacrificed himself again

234
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,920
to save Feng Tian.

235
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,090
Xingxian...

236
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,240
Xingxian was saved by you too?

237
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,520
Aren't you the one who saved her?

238
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,310
I just helped her a couple of times

239
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,380
by coincidence.

240
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,790
Even a small change

241
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,880
can lead to a different outcome.

242
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,530
You scolded Xingxian,

243
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,320
and that woke her up.

244
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,130
She went to the government office

245
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,010
to sue Zhang Pu

246
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,640
and ask for a divorce.

247
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,300
Did Zhang Pu agree?

248
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,020
Of course not.

249
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,870
But Chilian has been in Guangping

250
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,800
for so many years

251
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,690
and has some influence there.

252
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,240
Plus, Lord Geng from the government office

253
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,320
is quite fair,

254
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,810
so he ruled in favor of their divorce.

255
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Chilian even found a job

256
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,550
for Xingxian.

257
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,960
This time,

258
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,630
it shouldn't end

259
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,750
as badly as before.

260
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,720
Didn't you

261
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,270
dislike Xingxian before?

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,130
Why did you help her?

263
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,550
She's not a bad person.

264
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,350
It's just that

265
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,550
in her suffering,

266
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,690
she lost her kindness bit by bit.

267
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,020
But for what happened before,

268
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,000
Chilian can't be absolved of responsibility.

269
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,000
So,

270
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,240
you saved everyone.

271
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,390
I did

272
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,760
what I could.

273
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,890
What about Shen Tunan?

274
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Have you seen him?

275
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,600
I have.

276
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,340
He didn't go to the Carefree Land.

277
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,270
He's just

278
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,750
an ordinary

279
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,750
demon hunter now.

280
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,050
But just like before,

281
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,080
any demon in his hands

282
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,450
can't escape death.

283
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,310
I disciplined him twice.

284
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,200
And with my father's restrictions,

285
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,120
he's become much more restrained

286
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,000
over the years.

287
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm glad to hear that.

288
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,250
What about you?

289
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,790
Are you happy

290
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
being He Quelian?

291
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,960
I...

292
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,540
can't see demons anymore.

293
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
Now I just eat, drink, and have fun every day.

294
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,940
I've been going to school,

295
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,180
and I even learned how to ride a horse.

296
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,030
And my father found a martial arts master

297
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,960
to teach me.

298
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,400
I may not be as good as you,

299
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,270
but I'm not bad.

300
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,510
But for some reason,

301
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,120
I just felt unhappy.

302
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,100
It was like there was a piece missing in my heart.

303
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,730
There was something I couldn't remember,

304
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,760
but I didn't know what it was.

305
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,540
Xuanye,

306
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,420
can you not leave me?

307
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,620
Xuanye...

308
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,370
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,510
My Lady.

310
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,380
My Lady, where have you been?

311
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,350
I've been looking for you all night.

312
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,550
I even went to the government office.

313
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,240
Chief Constable Chu is leading

314
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,790
the entire government office in search of you.

315
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,890
If we can't find you today,

316
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,750
I'll have to notify His Lordship.

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,440
Alright.

318
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm back now, aren't I?

319
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,210
If you had gone missing,

320
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,640
His Lordship would've scolded me to death.

321
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,680
Go to the government office now

322
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,480
and let Chief Constable Chu and the others know I'm safe.

323
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,140
Don't let them worry anymore.

324
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,500
I'll go right away.

325
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,310
Go now.

326
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,730
Come with me.

327
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,180
No one has lived there for a long time.

328
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,110
Only Chi Xue goes up occasionally.

329
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,750
Uncle Jiu knows

330
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,270
the rules of the Real-felicity Sword.

331
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,070
You could reveal yourself to him.

332
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,170
Fate has changed.

333
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,510
They've long forgotten about me.

334
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,790
Telling him

335
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,520
would only cause him more trouble.

336
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,210
But if you say it,

337
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
he will definitely believe you.

338
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,660
Our connections are gone.

339
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,810
Even if he believes me,

340
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,260
things won't return to how they were.

341
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,240
But at least,

342
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,270
you've remembered everything now.

343
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,310
That's

344
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,070
the greatest gift to me.

345
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,350
I dare not

346
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,350
ask for more.

347
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,060
Gift...

348
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,630
That's right.

349
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,060
I gained

350
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,120
12 years of time for no reason

351
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,350
and learned so many skills.

352
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,880
Now I'm good at both literature and martial arts.

353
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,410
Pretty impressive, right?

354
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,890
Yes, of course.

355
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,960
Your literary talent is exceptional,

356
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,070
your martial arts skills are remarkable,

357
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,440
and you're great at cooking.

358
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,770
It's truly impressive.

359
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,450
But you've never seen me cook.

360
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,830
What's wrong?

361
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,750
Xuanye,

362
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,270
let's go out for a walk.

363
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,000
Sure.

364
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,010
Where do you want to go?

365
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go to the places we went before.

366
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,570
Let's go to Yanlai Restaurant for drinks,

367
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,500
to Fa'en Temple to offer incense,

368
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,640
fish by the lake,

369
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,000
visit Mrs. Yu's dessert shop,

370
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,110
and buy some snacks at Sanyuan Shop.

371
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,740
In short,

372
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,640
let's just stroll around

373
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,100
Guangping City together,

374
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
just the two of us.

375
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,720
Alright.

376
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,440
Let's enjoy ourselves

377
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,510
together.

378
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,590
♫When you're in love, your smile is like the spring breeze♫

379
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,380
♫Walking beside me, bathed in moonlight♫

380
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,590
♫No need for words, I already feel it♫

381
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,150
♫Dark hair like ink, time stretches on♫

The elders say

429
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,030
that if two people in love

430
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,690
share a snowfall,

431
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,590

435
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,440
the snow will melt as soon as it hits the ground,

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,640
No,

567
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,160
I haven't.

568
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,310
Don't listen to his nonsense.

569
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,590
I'm just a minor official,

570
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,650
hardly worthy of being called a Lady.

571
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,590
I'm a friend of Chu Youhuang.

572
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,190
Everyone,

573
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,060
please just call me Lingying.

574
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,530
Hello, Miss Lingying.

575
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,270
Then, shall we...

576
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,350
Please, sit down.

577
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,280
Lady Sima, please.

578
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,040
After you.

579
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,690
Please, sit.

580
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,680
Banxia,

581
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,170
I see there's a heater roasting meat.

582
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,370
Did you prepare wine?

583
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,470
We prepared wine from Huang Village. Is it strong enough?

584
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:29,960
Jiu,

585
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,220
you look like someone who knows his wine.

586
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,720
The wine from Huang Village here

587
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,060
is my favorite.

588
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,890
New clothes.

589
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,730
How do I look?

590
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,760
Do I look good?

591
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,950
Who invited you here?

592
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,270
Xuanye.

593
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,640
You know each other?

594
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,320
What's his background anyway?

595
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,550
He...

596
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't think

597
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,000
he looks like a proper merchant.

598
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,170
Why are you asking about him?

599
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,070
I'm asking for my young lady.

600
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,510
I don't know

601
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,480
what kind of spell

602
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,010
he has cast on my young lady.

603
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,440
They've only known each other for a few days,

604
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,150
and they're already inseparable.

605
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,030
When my master

606
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,980
and madam return,

607
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,110
they'll be furious.

608
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,139
Let me take it over there.

609
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,190
Here it comes!

610
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,889
Thank you.

611
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,320
Come, sit and eat with us.

612
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,570
Smells delicious.

613
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,630
Here, Jiu.

614
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,630
Your favorite.

615
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,170
Banxia,

616
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,170
pork belly.

617
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,400
Jiu, how long have you been in Guangping?

618
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,199
Are you planning to stay longer?

619
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,610
I've been here for a while.

620
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,760
But I've almost finished

621
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,960
what I came here to do.

622
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,270
I'll be leaving soon.

623
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,320
Jiu,

624
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,190
I heard that in the past two years, Jingchu has suffered

625
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,030
a spring drought, a summer flood,

626
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,230
and a great disaster.

627
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,440
Even with the imperial court's aid,

628
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,100
it's just a drop in the bucket.

629
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,010
Has your hometown been affected?

630
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,030
These years

631
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,840
have been tough for everyone.

632
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,570
Everyone is having a hard time.

633
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,090
But solutions are always devised by people.

634
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
As long as we keep going

635
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,240
and work hard,

636
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,790
we'll make it through

637
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,280
and see the light

638
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,090
at the end of the tunnel.

639
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,510
That's right.

640
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,400
A major disaster doesn't last more than three years.

641
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,550
Think about how difficult it was for every founding emperor

642
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,110
to establish their dynasty.

643
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,880
Which of them didn't start from nothing?

644
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,710
But now,

645
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,030
haven't they all ended up

646
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,620
living comfortable and prosperous lives?

647
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,480
Could our hardships be worse than theirs?

648
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
As long as we persist

649
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,710
and keep working hard,

650
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,310
there will be a good outcome.

651
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,480
Remember,

652
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,920
man can always conquer nature.

653
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,590
Well said.

654
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,630
Here!

655
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,920
Man can always conquer nature.

656
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,230
Tingzhou,

657
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,760
come and eat some.

658
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,960
I'll do the roasting.

659
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,590
Here, Jiu.

660
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,450
Let me help you.

661
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,840
Banxia,

662
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,670
what's your relationship

663
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,590
with Mr. Jiu?

664
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,580
Don't worry.

665
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,240
I won't tell your father.

666
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,360
Didn't I just tell you?

667
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,290
That was not the truth.

668
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,320
I can tell you and Mr. Jiu

669
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,410
are more than just friends.

670
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,140
What about you?

671
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,440
Are you just friends

672
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,030
with Chu?

673
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,360
Banxia,

674
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,400
Commissioner and I

675
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,670
are truly just friends.

676
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,230
See?

677
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,840
This is their first meeting,

678
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,110
and she can already tell.

679
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,970
Yet you're still putting on airs.

680
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,840
Lady Sima,

681
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,230
if you ask me,

682
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,760
there are plenty of young men

683
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,440
in our government office.

684
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,770
Don't just stick to one.

685
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,710
Here.

686
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,520
Everyone,

687
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,020
let me propose a toast.

688
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,590
Today, we met Xuanye

689
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,190
and made a new friend.

690
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,290
Banxia is safely home.

691
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,590
Lady Sima

692
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,200
has been transferred to Guangping City.

693
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,110
And it seems like Youhuang

694
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,630
is about to start a family.

695
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,630
What are you talking about?

696
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,280
Well said.

697
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,670
Four joys have come to us all at once.

698
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,130
Come on,

699
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,940
bottoms up!

700
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,750
Here!

701
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,590
Eat up. Have more meat.

702
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,070
Let's roast more.

703
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,870
The meat skewers have gone cold.

704
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,200
Thank you, Lady Sima.

705
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,640
It's for Banxia.

706
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,280
Two!

707
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,760
Eight!

708
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,510
Drink up!

709
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,110
Four! Five!

710
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,810
Drink up!

711
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,630
Drink up!

712
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,760
That's right.

713
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,340
Lady Sima,

714
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,870
how can you avoid drinking?

715
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,740
Xuanye.

716
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,230
Another round.

717
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,690
Come on.

718
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,550
Let's have a drink.

719
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,590
Two!

720
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,090
Two!

721
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,670
Four!

722
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,110
Two!

723
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,430
Physician Jiu, why are you here?

724
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,190
I heard it was so lively

725
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,190
in the courtyard.

726
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,490
I didn't expect you to be here too.

727
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,760
Little bro,

728
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,750
I have something to ask you.

729
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,440
Who are you really?

730
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,880
Father.

731
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
You've suffered.

732
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,170
After seeing you that day,

733
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,810
I noticed a new mark on the Hidden Dragon Case.

734
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,820
That's when I realized

735
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,210
the Real-felicity Sword had been used,

736
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,330
and it was connected to you.

737
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:55,960
Either

738
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,480
I used

739
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,560
the Real-felicity Sword for you,

740
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,480
or

741
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,400
you used it yourself.

742
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,710
But in either case,

743
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
you must be

744
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,840
someone close to me.

745
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,490
Are you

746
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,410
staying in Guangping?

747
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,000
No.

748
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,170
My father has passed away.

749
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,960
The Mystic Panther Clan is in turmoil,

750
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,070
the Carefree Herb is dying in large patches,

751
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,000
and the Carefree Land is in danger.

752
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,630
Zi Kong can't

753
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,850
handle it alone.

754
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,760
When will the Realm Gate close?

755
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,310
About...

756
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,520
less than a day left.

757
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,010
So the next time we meet

758
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,110
will be 12 years later.

759
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,490
How have you been traveling

760
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,080
between the two realms all these years?

761
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,460
This thing

762
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
is called a Taofu.

763
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,590
It lets me move between realms.

764
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,530
But I've used it too many times.

765
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,130
It's broken now.

766
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,520
Is this the only one?

767
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,630
Yes.

768
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,270
What about that girl

769
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,960
from the Duan family?

770
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,110
Everyone has their own responsibilities.

771
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,970
We can't force things.

772
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,860
Since the Real-felicity Sword has been drawn,

773
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,520
you two shouldn't remember each other anymore.

774
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,630
But that girl

775
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,840
remembered everything.

776
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,280
Now,

777
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,070
I don't know whether that's a blessing

778
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,960
or a curse.

779
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,920
Your bonds have been severed.

780
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,050
What's gone is gone.

781
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,320
Don't let your mother and your brother

782
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,670
know about this.

783
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,590
Your brother

784
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,320
is getting married next month.

785
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,990
You won't make it in time.

786
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,920
Yes.

787
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,890
Well, that's it.

788
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,410
Go and do what you need to do.

789
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,000
Maybe one day,

790
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920
you and I

791
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,440
will meet again.

792
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,360
Father,

793
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,490
I, Xuanye,

794
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,360
thank you and Mother for raising me.

795
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,480
Youhuang,

796
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,710
come on, hurry up.

797
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,150
What are you hiding for?

798
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,670
This is between us—

799
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,070
we know what we're doing.

800
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,830
Do you?

801
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,590
Alright, alright, alright.

802
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,300
You're not young anymore...

803
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,900
Alright, alright, alright.

804
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,230
I'm afraid

805
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,250
I won't make it

806
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,290
to your wedding.

807
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,600
This

808
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,030
is my wedding gift to you.

809
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,750
Thank you.

810
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,120
I can't accept this gift.

811
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,960
About this marriage,

812
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,480
I still need to think it over.

813
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,110
Miss Sima,

814
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,260
don't mind him.

815
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,490
This gift is for you.

816
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,640
If one day

817
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,000
you marry someone else,

818
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,530
just send me an invitation.

819
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,620
Okay.

820
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,960
Xuanye, Banxia,

821
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,280
let's meet again another day.

822
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,110
Next time, come to my place,

823
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,310
and it'll be my treat.

824
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,880
Xuanye.

825
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,320
Take care.

826
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,960
Take care.

827
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,660
Banxia, thank you for your hospitality.

828
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,180
Farewell, Mr. Jiu.

829
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,560
Farewell.

830
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,590
Take care.

831
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,580
Is this gift heavy?

832
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,480
Let me carry it for you.

833
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,810
It's not heavy. No need.

834
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,140
Let me carry it for you.

835
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
Why don't you show me

836
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,620
what's inside?

837
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,920
This is Banxia's gift

838
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,840
for me and someone else's wedding.

839
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,760
What does it have to do with you?

840
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,400
What if it's very valuable?

841
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,330
I'm leaving too.

842
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,990
Chi Xue,

843
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,590
from now on, take good care of your master

844
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,670
and his wife.

845
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,700
Don't make them angry.

846
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,760
Also,

847
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,070
practice your martial arts diligently.

848
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,530
If you can't win, just run.

849
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,610
Don't be reckless.

850
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,570
Understand?

851
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,670
I got it.

852
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,240
Alright.

853
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,420
Go back now.

854
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,570
See me off for a bit.

855
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:05,800
Tingzhou.

856
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,880
I'm going out for a while.

857
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,400
Xuanye,

858
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,400
is the Carefree Land big?

859
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,280
It's very big.

860
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,170
Just like the human world,

861
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,730
it has vast land,

862
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,670
beautiful mountains and rivers,

863
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,930
and expansive oceans.

864
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,550
The Reversed Land

865
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,550
is just an entrance

866
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,750
to the Carefree Land.

867
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,850
Further inside,

868
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,040
it's the home

869
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,530
of countless demon clans.

870
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,720
So where do you live?

871
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,960
Pass through the habitat of those

872
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,220
powerful demon clans,

873
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,630
and you'll reach an ice field.

874
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,480
It's cold there, with heavy snow,

875
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,880
and a vast ice lake stretches for miles.

876
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,270
On the ice lake

877
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,450
stands a royal city.

878
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,220
That royal city

879
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,130
is the territory of the Mystic Panther Clan.

880
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,610
That's so far away.

881
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,480
Yes, it is.

882
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,410
The moon looks beautiful tonight.

883
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,510
Is there a moon in the Carefree Land?

884
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,120
Yes, there is.

885
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,030
That's good.

886
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,460
No matter how far apart we are,

887
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,760
we'll still look at

888
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,360
the same moon when we look up.

889
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,030
Indeed.

890
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,430
I'll see you off here.

891
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,850
Alright.

892
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,930
Take care of yourself.

893
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,960
I will.

894
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,800
You too.

895
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,380
I'll be going then.

It's called

the Carefree River.
