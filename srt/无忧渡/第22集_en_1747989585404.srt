1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The End

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:26,980
Themon

3
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

4
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

5
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

6
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

7
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

8
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

9
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:37,980
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the castle.

10
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:49,860
Italian

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
If you are here,

12
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
you'd better do it again.

13
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Yes.

14
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
No need to pay.

15
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
Do it again.

16
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,860
Do it again.

17
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,860
What does it mean to be a master?

18
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,860
You are here to gather us today

19
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
not to collect the money.

20
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,860
No.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
Then this student thinks

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,860
what's the purpose of the banquet today?

23
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,860
Today, you are here to gather us.

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,860
Second, you want to announce to the world

25
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,860
that as long as you have the money, you can do it.

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,860
After today, we will be the students of the king's family

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,860
and also the representatives of the Han family.

28
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,860
If we have a reputation in our bank,

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,860
we will remember our own birth today.

30
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,860
You are right.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,860
You are right.

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
You are right.

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
You are right.

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,860
You are right.

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
You are right.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,860
The nine brothers are so talented.

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,860
I really admire you.

38
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,860
We are as good as you.

39
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
From now on,

40
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,860
you are my best friend.

41
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,860
Liu,

42
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,860
you really said what I thought.

43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
I am lucky to know you.

44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,860
Since we are the same,

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,860
we should be friends.

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,860
Let's be friends.

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Let's be friends.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Let's be friends.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
Please excuse me.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
We are family after drinking the blood wine.

51
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Well...

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
Let me do it.

53
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
It's your turn.

54
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Okay.

55
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Let's do it together.

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
Okay.

57
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Come on.

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
What is this?

59
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Cheers.

60
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Let's drink.

61
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
Let's drink.

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Come on.

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Good wine.

64
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
Let's drink.

65
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Please.

66
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Why is there only one?

67
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,860
And we have such a big thing.

68
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
There is no reaction.

69
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
There must be a ghost.

70
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
You can go and have a look.

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,860
How can I look at so many people?

72
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
You can do it.

73
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Cao Ji Jiu.

74
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,860
Brother Duan wants to perform a sword dance for everyone.

75
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
Can you do it?

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Duan Xue Zi can dance sword dance.

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
You are a little bit confused.

78
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
A little bit confused.

79
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Go ahead.

80
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Tell me the dance.

81
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
I will.

82
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,940
The

83
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,860
Xie An Mang is not here.

84
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
How can these students have a hidden memory?

85
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
It's okay.

86
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Tomorrow they will be happy again.

87
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
But you are talking about this person.

88
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,860
He has changed his name to Nang Hu Ye Yan.

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
But he didn't say Xie An Wang.

90
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Yes.

91
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,860
Xuanyi.

92
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
My father remembers his own name.

93
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
He has no memory like us.

94
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,860
That means he will act according to the character he has in his paintings.

95
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Do you think Xie An Wang is your father?

96
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,860
This place is the most likely to have a hidden memory.

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
I will change it.

98
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Yes.

99
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Master.

100
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
Over there.

101
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,860
What you said yesterday is still a bit more.

102
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
What?

103
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
What?

104
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
You said you liked me yesterday.

105
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
I just want to know what you said.

106
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I just want to know what you said.

107
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,860
I just want to know what you said.

108
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,860
You said you liked me.

109
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I don't know when it happened.

110
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
It seems like a long time ago.

111
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
You remember it all?

112
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
I thought you didn't remember what I said.

113
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Does he remember what's not important?

114
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Then I will say.

115
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Yes.

116
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,860
I had a lot of concerns before.

117
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,860
I had a lot of engagement.

118
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
But I don't like that guy at all.

119
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
But I also understand that after all,

120
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,860
it's still a long time ago.

121
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
But after all this time,

122
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I found that

123
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
we really like you.

124
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
So no matter what you said,

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
I decided to admit you anyway.

126
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
Go.

127
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
You don't like me.

128
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
You still admit her?

129
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
He Julien.

130
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
You are too deep.

131
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Go after her.

132
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Follow me.

133
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,860
How about we go to the temple first?

134
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,860
This is the temple of Buddha.

135
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
It's about the master.

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
I don't believe that the demon will kill me here.

137
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Let's go.

138
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
What are you doing?

139
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,860
I will try.

140
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
What are you doing?

141
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Don't you think this is my mother?

142
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,860
The biggest miracle of the flower exhibition is the tears.

143
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,860
The tears are the cause of death.

144
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
This is the real big deal.

145
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,860
The real six-leaf clover.

146
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Mother.

147
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Is it you?

148
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
Mother.

149
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
Mother.

150
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
Mother.

151
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
Mother.

152
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Mother.

153
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Mother.

154
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
What's wrong?

155
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,860
Why is mother here?

156
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Why is she like this?

157
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Mother.

158
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Can you remember me?

159
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
Mother.

160
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Are you a fan?

161
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,860
Mother.

162
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Mother.

163
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,860
I am Fan Xia.

164
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
Why are you like this?

165
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Father.

166
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Fan Xia.

167
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Are you sure this is your father?

168
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,860
Father.

169
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Father.

170
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
Father.

171
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Father.

172
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
What's wrong?

173
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
It's me.

174
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
It's me.

175
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
Fan Xia.

176
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
It's me.

177
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
I am Fan Xia.

178
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
What's wrong?

179
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
Father.

180
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Father.

181
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Father.

182
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
Father.

183
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Father.

184
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Father.

185
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
Father, why are you like this?

186
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Father.

187
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
Brother, are you hurt?

188
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Father.

189
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Father.

190
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
Brother.

191
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
Brother.

192
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Brother.

193
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Why are you here?

194
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,860
Brother.

195
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,360
Brother.

196
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,860
Brother, what happened?

197
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
I cannot rest in peace revolutionary.

198
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,880
Why are you here?

199
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,860
Why are you here?

200
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Brother, please forgive me.

201
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Brother.

202
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,860
I don't care what you do.

203
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
Brother.

204
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Brother.

205
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,080
A their

206
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,580
a

207
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,740
LOL

208
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Ha ha ha

209
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
All give me

210
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Thank you

211
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,740
Then

212
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Why can't my father see

213
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
Can't hear and can't talk

214
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
He was sealed for 30 days

215
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
The outside world is closed

216
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Is that monster doing it

217
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
I have been thinking

218
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Why that monster caught your mother

219
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Not enough

220
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
And you father caught it

221
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Now I understand

222
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Is for Guan Yin Luo Lei

223
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
He put your mother here

224
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
But not Luo Lei's Guan Yin Xiang

225
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Can't take this

226
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,740
He really is a sad and bitter heart

227
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Father

228
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
I will definitely save you and mother

229
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Go out

230
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Don't be too worried

231
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Your father was just sealed for 30 days

232
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,740
It's okay to leave here

233
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
fast

234
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
go

235
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
Liu Mekui

236
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Liu Mekui

237
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Sister-in-law

238
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
How did you know that she came here

239
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
What happened

240
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
The head is in the government

241
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Sister-in-law

242
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
I'm sorry

243
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
Sister-in-law, don't be angry

244
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
I'm not in a marriage

245
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Today there is a man

246
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
He chose to meet today

247
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I can't help but retreat

248
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Did you bring the right person personally

249
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Did something happen to Yueyue before?

250
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
The world changed in the picture

251
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
Who is Yueyue

252
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
It's a killer

253
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
What does it look like

254
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
More than 50 years old

255
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
But the hand is very cruel

256
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
It's the one in the body

257
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Where is he now

258
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Said to go to Chen Xi

259
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Sister-in-law, we are leaving first

260
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
go

261
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
go

262
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,740
This person is a killer of the tiger den

263
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
High-power martial arts

264
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Brotherhood

265
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
There are more than ten people in his hands

266
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Just now

267
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
He killed several of our brothers

268
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
from the prison

269
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
So

270
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
You must get the case as soon as possible

271
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Are you all clear

272
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Isn't it going to Chen Xi?

273
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
What are you doing here

274
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
It's too far, let's talk about the horses

275
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
go

276
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Qu Lian

277
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Qu Lian, sorry

278
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Our marriage is probably going to be postponed

279
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
It's okay

280
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
I understand

281
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
It's important to pretend to be a criminal

282
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,740
This is

283
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
My friend

284
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Master

285
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740
Master, Xun Chunwei is in the south water street

286
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,740
He is running away to protect him

287
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
South water street

288
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
go

289
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
He and the two of them

290
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
They both ride away my horse

291
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
What am I riding

292
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,740
This is his place

293
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
I will see the real thing

294
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
I will see

295
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
The business

296
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
The business is him

297
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
I will get it

298
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,740
I am not fast

299
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,740
I am not fast

300
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
I think you are not that fast

301
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
It seems that his power is the same as mine

302
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
He will be limited in painting

303
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Zhao, how can you be so fast

304
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
This is the business

305
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
The business

306
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,880
Please

307
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Is not doing

308
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,180
Right.

309
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,760
Geh...

310
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,420
Enemy's behind us.

311
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,100
shot and

312
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,440
you away that

313
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,460
ah

314
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,540
oh

315
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,440
ah

316
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,500
ah

317
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,220
ah

318
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,560
Ah

319
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,940
There are only a few people left.

320
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,140
Catch them all!

321
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Yes!

322
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
That's the direction of the underground city!

323
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,140
That's the exit to the world of painting!

324
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Sister!

325
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,340
You caught my father and mother!

326
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,340
I'll kill you!

327
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,140
You're going to kill me!

328
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
Bansha!

329
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,540
You guys, wait!

330
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Sister!

331
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Bansha!

332
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
Bansha!

333
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,740
Wait!

334
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,740
I want to look at your fingers first

335
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,940
and then your face.

336
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,540
Then your head!

337
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,740
No, no, no!

338
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,740
No, no, no!

339
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
I want to look at your face first

340
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
and then your fingers.

341
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,740
And then your head.

342
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,740
Sister!

343
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Ruhuang!

344
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
Find the doctor!

345
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Help Bansha!

346
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
Qu Yuan!

347
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
Bansha!

348
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
Qu Yuan!

349
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,140
Qu Yuan, what's wrong?

350
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Find the doctor!

351
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Help!

352
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,140
Qu Yuan!

353
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Sister, hold on!

354
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Come, take care of her!

355
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Yes, yes!

356
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Bansha!

357
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,140
Sister!

358
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,140
Xu Li!

359
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
Sister!

360
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,540
What's wrong with the old man?

361
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Why is he dead?

362
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Why is he dead?

363
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
He was right next to me.

364
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
He didn't know what to do

365
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
and why he didn't say anything.

366
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
He must have asked for his life

367
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,540
when he was with the old man.

368
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Let's go!

369
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
Brother!

370
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Brother!

371
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
Brother!

372
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Brother!

373
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Brother!

374
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
Brother!

375
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
Brother!

376
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Brother!

377
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Brother!

378
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
Brother!

379
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Brother!

380
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Brother!

381
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Where is Brother?

382
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Brother is here again.

383
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Go to the museum to see.

384
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Mr KazAtak

385
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Mr KazAtak

386
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Uncle!

387
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
What is wrong?

388
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,340
Besides,

389
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,240
angel was really right.

390
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,240
They refused the proposal.

391
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
Eh!

392
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,640
Oh well!

393
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:49,840
O will follow me!

394
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
What is this?

395
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Who is this?

396
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Miss, you know him?

397
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Miss, you are almost there.

398
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Hurry and catch the time.

399
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Don't hit him.

400
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Don't hit him.

401
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Are you okay, big brother?

402
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Big brother.

403
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Everyone, my big brother has been injured this morning.

404
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
He has a heart attack.

405
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I heard my big brother give you a compensation.

406
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
I mean,

408
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
you two are not in the same team.

409
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
I mean, what's going on?

410
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
He is crazy.

411
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
He even dares to leave the house.

412
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
It's our fault. We didn't take good care of him.

413
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
You are making a big mistake.

414
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Don't show us any respect.

415
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Master, look.

416
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
This is the day of the big wedding.

417
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I won't argue with you.

418
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Hurry and go back.

419
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Thank you, big brother.

420
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Big brother.

421
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
What's wrong with him?

422
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
Is he really in a bad mood?

423
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
I don't know.

424
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I didn't see him like this before.

425
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Why is he in a good mood?

426
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
What's wrong with him?

427
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
He is in a bad mood.

428
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
It's a big deal.

429
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Didn't we have a river here?

430
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
We can go to the underground city.

431
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Why can't we see it?

432
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
What did he say to you?

433
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
You don't know

434
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
there was a river here?

435
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
I've never heard of a river.

436
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I've never heard of underground city.

437
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I've never heard of it.

438
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I've never heard of it.

439
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
I've never thought

440
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
that you can do anything

441
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
with your nose drawn.

442
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
The underground city

443
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
is just beginning.

444
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Come with me.

445
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
I want to play with you.

446
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
I want to play with you.

447
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Come with me.

448
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Come with me.

449
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Come with me.

450
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Come with me.

451
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Come with me.

452
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Come with me.

453
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Come with me.

454
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Come with me.

455
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Come with me.

456
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Come with me.

457
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Come with me.

458
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
We are working

459
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
in the same clothes.

460
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
You can't be too careful.

461
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
You've got me.

462
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Stop talking nonsense.

463
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Brother.

464
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Why are you still here

465
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
after all these days?

466
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Come.

467
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Come with me.

468
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
It's getting dark.

469
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Don't you feel hungry?

470
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Come with me.

471
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
Come with me.

472
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
It's useless to run so fast.

473
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Can you be faster

474
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
than the drawing pen?

475
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
What did you say just now?

476
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I said you can't be faster

477
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
than the drawing pen.

478
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
You shouldn't have

479
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
found that new bride.

480
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
How do you know?

481
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Who are you?

482
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
I'm a man who escaped

483
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
from the South Lake.

484
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
I escaped from my own story.

485
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
You are the one who took me in?

486
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
You went to the South Lake.

487
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Why are you here?

488
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Isn't it obvious?

489
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
It's hot here in the daytime.

490
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
It's quiet at night.

491
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
You can be yourself.

492
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
I'm asking you.

493
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Why are you in the drawing?

494
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
Mr. Nian.

495
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
What year is it now?

496
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
It's the eighth year of Tianxiang.

497
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
It's been two years.

498
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
How do I feel

499
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
if it's more than a few hundred years?

500
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Two years ago,

501
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
I got the blood test

502
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
to visit the world's most famous medicine.

503
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
In front of the Shen Laobing Temple,

504
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
whether you are a royal family

505
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
or a famous person,

506
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
it's a ritual.

507
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Someone told me that

508
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
there was a real man

509
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Huang Pubei

510
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
who was a monster.

511
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
I believed

512
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
that this woman would come here.

513
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
You are here to seek medical treatment.

514
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
It's a pity that it's late.

515
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
The doctor said that I was already ill.

516
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
He couldn't help it.

517
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
I was in the underground

518
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
and I was in the middle of the night.

519
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I was so excited.

520
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
I went to the Tihu Shujai.

521
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
The chief of the village

522
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
heard my story.

523
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
He told me that he had a way to save me.

524
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
He said that there is a

525
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
best place in the world.

526
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
As long as you are there,

527
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
I can still be my lord.

528
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
And I will be free from the pain.

529
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
The most important thing is

530
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
to live long and not die.

531
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
You believe it?

532
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Of course.

533
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
You don't understand

534
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
the kind of

535
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
high-ranking people we have.

536
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I have believed that

537
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
I am more than a madman.

538
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
And I am not

539
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
lying.

540
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I left it

541
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
and I am still a memory.

542
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
I am always happy.

543
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
If I didn't wake up

544
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
maybe

545
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
I would have survived.

546
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
How did you wake up?

547
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I couldn't remember.

548
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
I only know that one day

549
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
I drew a picture

550
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
and a picture of the moon.

551
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
And it suddenly woke up.

552
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
I saw

553
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
this picture of my wife.

554
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
She woke up.

555
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Where is that picture?

556
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
It's gone.

557
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
I burned it.

558
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Because my wife died.

559
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
You don't understand.

560
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
If you wake up

561
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
and don't accept the arrangement of the picture,

562
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
you will die.

563
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Everything in the picture

564
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
is based on the new meaning.

565
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
No one is willing to accept the meaning

566
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
of the picture.

567
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
No one is willing to admit the place

568
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
of the match.

569
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
No one is willing to believe the truth

570
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
and see the truth.

571
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
And this truth

572
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
is to make you disappear completely.

573
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
People will

574
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
see the stars as they are.

575
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
The soul of God.

576
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
The soul of God.

577
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
What's wrong?

578
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
You also believe it.

579
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Do you regret it?

580
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Regret?

581
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Do you regret coming here?

582
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
What's the use of regret?

583
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
I made my own choice.

584
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
But I was locked here.

585
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I didn't want to live.

586
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
I was afraid that I would disappear.

587
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
The underground city used to be a tree.

588
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Although it's gone now,

589
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
there must be another thing.

590
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
It's useless.

591
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
I'm the one.

592
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Everything in the picture

593
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
is based on the meaning of the picture.

594
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
The stars of the sun and moon are all in the sky and earth.

595
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Including you and me.

596
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
She is so good at drawing.

597
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Why don't you draw a moon?

598
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Who's hungry?

599
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Is that the person?

600
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
This is so good.

601
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Look.

602
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Brother, what's wrong?

603
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
I don't know.

604
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Is my brain broken?

605
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
I can't drink so much.

606
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I can drink a few bottles.

607
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Brother,

608
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,080
you don't want to go to work today?

609
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
I don't want to go.

610
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I...

611
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
I don't want to go either.

612
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
What does it have to do with you?

613
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,080
If you really don't want to go to work today,

614
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
then take a rest.

615
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
We'll go to work.

616
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
I... I'm not going.

617
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Brother, I'm not going.

618
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
I'm going.

619
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
You're not going to work?

620
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
You're not going to work?

621
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Give me a sip.

622
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Brother,

623
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
brother,

624
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
give me a sip.

625
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
It's gone.

626
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
It's gone.

627
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Thank you.

628
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Brother.

629
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,880
Brother, brother.

630
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Yang Kai.

631
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,080
Brother, you haven't eaten for a day.

632
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,880
Yang Kai.

633
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
It's been a day.

634
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,080
Please.

635
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Come, take me.

636
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Okay.

637
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Brother, please sit down.

638
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
Sit down.

639
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,680
Old Fan, go buy it.

640
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
I don't have much money in my heart.

641
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,480
I have money on you.

642
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Buy some food for brother.

643
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,480
Brother, what do you want to eat?

644
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,680
Noodles or less?

645
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Yang Fei.

646
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,480
Buy some Yang Fei.

647
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,880
I want Yang Fei soup.

648
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Okay.

649
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Are you tired?

650
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,480
Come, add some sauce.

651
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,880
Okay.

652
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,880
You don't know the rules.

653
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
Come.

654
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,680
Brother, how can you drink this soup?

655
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,280
Put some of this.

656
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Is it done?

657
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,280
Right away.

658
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,080
Put some green onions.

659
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Yang Fei.

660
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,480
What do you think?

661
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,880
What do you think?

662
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,260
This way.

663
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,800
OK The Kurdish pun is very reasonable

664
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,500
like this.

665
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,060
And we translated it into Chinese.

666
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,220
Thank you.

667
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,820
I'll do it later.

668
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,160
Thanks.

669
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,240
Boss

670
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm sorry.

671
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Boss, here's your drink.

672
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Okay.

673
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
Here you go.

674
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Take it.

675
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
It's done!

676
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Where's the man?

677
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
You're here, kid.

678
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
I'll wait for you.

679
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
You're a businessman.

680
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
I'm here!

681
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,240
What's going on?

682
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Good boy.

683
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
You're so smart.

684
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
I'll let you try this.

685
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
What's going on?

686
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Kill them!

687
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Get away!

688
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
Get away!

689
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Get away!

690
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
I'm sorry.

694
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
I'm sorry.
