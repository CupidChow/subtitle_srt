3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,460
Good, you're here.

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,080
Where did you take my dad?

5
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,100
You've got some nerve.

6
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,140
I'm not afraid of you at all!

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,310
Is that so?

8
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
It's a trap again!

9
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,640
Impressive.

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,020
Take Tingzhou out.

11
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,730
No worries.

12
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,130
We're fully prepared.

13
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,790
There's no way he's getting away this time.

14
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,790
He's really here?

15
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Let me see

16
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
who he is!

17
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,690
I'm here to help you!

[Heal and Help]

19
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,120
There's no big deal.

20
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
Take some medicine, and you'll be fine.

21
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,020
I'll prescribe it for you.

22
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,140
Thank you, Physician Jiu.

23
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,390
My Lady.

24
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,690
Actually, I heard you call me

25
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,570
last night.

26
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,960
But I don't know why.

27
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,240
I could hear,

28
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
but I just couldn't open my eyes

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
or move a bit.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,130
You were bewitched by a demonic spell.

31
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,920
I seriously injured that demon.

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,779
It'll take him a while to recover.

33
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,480
Just in case,

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,660
the government should warn everyone in the city

35
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
not to play the game

36
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,230
of pear-genie summoning anymore.

37
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,500
Well...

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
If we issue such a notice as you said,

39
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
what are the people going to think

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,830
of our government office?

41
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,800
Then just buy

42
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,900
all the pears.

43
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,260
Well...

44
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,830
Wait, Xuanye...

45
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,870
Banxia,

46
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,290
come with me.

47
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,210
What are you doing?

48
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,010
What's wrong with you?

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,310
I'm fine.

50
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,870
You look like you're going to faint.

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,130
What are you going to do?

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Xuanye...

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
Banxia,

54
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,270
come here.

55
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,140
Hey, you...

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,740
What's wrong with you?

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,120
Xuan...

58
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,600
What's this?

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,750
That Mirror Demon is still alive.

60
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,070
He might come again.

61
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,640
If you run into danger,

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,700
you must wake me up.

63
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,490
If you can't wake me,

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,260
just stab me with this.

65
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,190
Why should I stab you?

66
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,230
Did you

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,500
catch what I just said?

68
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Yes.

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,760
But what's happening?

70
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm feeling too drowsy.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,940
I want to sleep.

72
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,010
What did the two of them go to do?

73
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,990
To sleep.

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,800
Sleep?

75
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,130
I don't think

76
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,860
this is appropriate.

77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,600
Xuanye used the Mountain-shaking Sword.

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,150
Wait,

79
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,330
what does the Mountain-shaking Sword

80
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,730
have to do with sleeping?

81
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,960
Every sword he uses

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,510
takes a different toll on him.

83
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,670
Dubhe makes him gluttonous;

84
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,730
Mountain-shaking makes him sleepy.

85
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,390
But he still can't

86
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,159
drag My Lady into it.

87
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,920
This demon is hard to deal with.

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Except Xuanye,

89
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,800
who else can protect

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,550
your lady?

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,240
Youhuang,

92
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,560
where are you going?

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,409
Youhuang!

94
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,610
I'm talking to you!

95
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,800
You ignore me every time I call you!

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,460
Youhuang!

97
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,690
Wait for me!

98
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,360
Um,

99
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,390
what should we do now?

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
What do you mean?

101
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,320
There's a demon around.

102
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,750
I'm too scared to go back home alone.

103
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,980
You can go find an inn.

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,070
Xuanye.

105
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,100
Xuanye.

106
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm so thirsty.

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,270
I want to have some water.

108
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,770
A cultivator? Seriously?

109
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,950
Don't you even know men and women should keep a proper distance?

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm engaged, okay?

111
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,270
If they call off the engagement,

112
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,730
will you marry me instead?

113
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,470
Oh...

114
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,900
Jeez, seriously?

115
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,130
Well,

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,150
um...

117
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,510
And down here...

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,590
Sir,

119
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,540
what are you doing?

120
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,140
We didn't do anything illegal.

121
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Why are you confiscating our pears?

122
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,540
Consider it as the government buying them from you.

123
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,430
You can go ask the government for money.

124
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,950
Well...

125
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,120
Sir,

126
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
I also have

127
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
some pears to sell at home.

128
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,090
Does the government need more?

129
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,850
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

130
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,150
Send them all to the government office

131
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,010
with none left!

132
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes, sir. I'll fetch them right away.

133
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,410
Are you alright?

134
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,020
That demon hunter's power is overwhelming.

135
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,150
I'm no match for him.

136
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,650
We can't stay here any longer.

137
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,480
Go pack up.

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,540
We'll leave the city tonight.

139
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,180
You're so badly injured.

140
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,360
Where can we be

141
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,300
if not here?

142
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,630
You stay here for rehabilitation.

143
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,590
Let's make long-term plans

144
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,990
after you recover, okay?

145
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,970
How are things going out there?

146
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,530
Everything's fine.

147
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,750
What's wrong?

148
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,150
Nothing.

149
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,270
I thought you wouldn't come tonight.

150
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,250
I was held up by the dance troupe.

151
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,150
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

152
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,740
I'm willing to wait for my wife

153
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,270
no matter how long it takes.

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,370
Despite a few

155
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,420
twists and turns about our marriage,

156
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,000
my father

157
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,520
finally gave his consent to it.

158
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,230
He also said

159
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,150
he would give us a shop as a gift.

160
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
But the condition is that

161
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,330
we can neither invite our friends

162
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,220
nor hold a grand wedding at home.

163
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,330
I understand his concerns.

164
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,920
And I'm actually

165
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,850
quite tempted by that shop.

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,980
But after careful consideration,

167
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,840
I still said no.

168
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,340
Because I promised you

169
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,200
I will give you a proper and official wedding ceremony.

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,110
I also want everyone in the city

171
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,130
to know that

172
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,990
you will marry me,

173
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,860
and that you're the most beautiful woman in the world.

174
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't want a grand wedding ceremony.

175
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,460
Let's leave this place together.

176
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Let's go to a place

177
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,940
where no one knows us.

178
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,440
I have some savings.

179
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,200
I can keep you company when you study

180
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,130
and cook for you.

181
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,560
As long as I can be with you,

182
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,160
even if

183
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,220
it's just one year,

184
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,100
I'll have no regrets in my life.

185
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,610
You don't want to?

186
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,920
I do.

187
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,070
Having you is the best thing

188
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,380
I could ask for.

189
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,870
Who are you?

190
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,750
What do you want?

191
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,470
Don't you really want to

192
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,520
be with her?

193
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,880
Then I'll let you stay with her forever!

194
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,520
Li.

195
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,550
What are you busy with?

196
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,080
Nothing.

197
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,520
The mirror's face-down.

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,780
Why did you still come?

199
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,970
Didn't we agree that

200
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,160
when the mirror is flipped over,

201
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,820
that means I'm not available?

202
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,870
Is it necessary

203
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,040
between you and me?

204
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,200
Or

205
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,110
is there a secret

206
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,510
you don't want me to know?

207
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,350
Nope.

208
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,380
Just some women's issues.

209
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,030
What brings you here?

210
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,930
I'm here to send you a pear.

211
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,260
I've washed it.

212
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,200
Take it.

213
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,160
Didn't you promise me

214
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,950
you wouldn't kill people

215
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,700
for pears again before the right time?

216
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
That being said,

217
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,690
he made a wish.

218
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,740
I had to grant it.

219
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,890
I don't want to eat.

220
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,710
Li,

221
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,130
be good.

222
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,830
Don't infuriate me.

223
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,030
Good girl.

224
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,780
Why doesn't this pear have a fishy smell?

225
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,760
I almost forgot.

226
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,630
I couldn't help but kill him

227
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,530
as soon as he ate it.

228
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,250
I was supposed to wait seven days,

229
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,160
but I really couldn't help it.

230
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,200
When I saw his face,

231
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,650
I couldn't wait

232
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,820
to wipe him out immediately.

233
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,200
You mortals always say,

234
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,720
"What you eat makes who you are." Right?

235
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,730
The owner of this pear

236
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,890
is a scholar.

237
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
I guess

238
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,520
this pear

239
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,030
boasts some scholarly properties.

240
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,350
Eat it,

241
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,950
and you'll understand

242
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,920
the meaning of "loyalty"

243
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,319
and "fidelity."

244
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,350
Banxia.

245
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,080
You're awake.

246
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,540
Tingzhou and Chi Xue

247
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,140
went to buy groceries for me.

248
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,800
You must be hungry.

249
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,200
I've made some porridge.

250
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Why did you leave?

251
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,960
Didn't I tell you

252
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,150
to stick around me?

253
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,730
But I didn't leave the Ganshan Clinic,

254
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,760
nor did I go out.

255
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
You slept for three whole days.

256
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,960
We've been tied together the whole time.

257
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,910
I needed to eat, drink,

258
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,990
wash up, and use the bathroom, right?

259
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,100
My bad. I forgot that.

260
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,160
I know you were worried about my safety.

261
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,810
But to protect me,

262
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,910
there's actually a simpler method.

263
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,910
What is it?

264
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,150
Draw another mark on me.

265
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,600
That monster hasn't been caught yet.

266
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,430
I'm afraid...

267
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,290
Done.

268
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,480
Xuanye.

269
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,400
I saw a scar on your chest.

270
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,660
When did you get that?

271
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,040
I saw it by accident.

272
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,140
It's a big scar.

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,760
Quite scary.

274
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,080
So when did you

275
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,610
get hurt?

276
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
I don't remember.

277
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,090
You don't remember?

278
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,480
That was a deep wound

279
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
so close to your heart.

280
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,520
You almost died.

281
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,290
How could you not remember?

282
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,330
I don't remember anything

283
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,450
from my childhood.

284
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,090
What are you looking at?

285
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,000
Do you want some more?

286
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,800
Xuanye,

287
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
can I

288
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,740
go get changed later?

289
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,110
It's been three days.

290
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,560
It's going to stink.

291
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,490
After I finish it

292
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,830
I'll escort you back.

293
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,190
Okay.

294
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,910
Chief.

295
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,640
Chief!

296
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,140
A weird case again!

297
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,250
What happened?

298
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,200
Another murder occurred.

299
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,830
The victim, Zhou Jingyuan,

300
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,560
24 years old,

301
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,860
a local in Guangping,

302
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,870
was found dead

303
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,670
this morning.

304
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,080
His case is quite similar to Tian Rui's.

305
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,140
But he didn't turn into a dried corpse

306
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,320
Didn't turn into a dried corpse?

307
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
He just aged a bit.

308
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,620
Didn't turn into a dried corpse?

309
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,910
Are you Chief Constable Chu?

310
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,640
Yes, it's me.

311
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,500
Get up and talk.

312
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,480
Are you the one who reported the case?

313
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,870
Yes.

314
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,960
Sir,

315
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,890
I'm just a merchant.

316
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,510
I know little about

317
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,370
autopsies and how to crack cases.

318
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,300
But I've never seen anything

319
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,020
spookier than this

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,870
in my whole life.

321
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,000
May I see the body?

322
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Please go ahead, sir.

323
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,970
My son...

324
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,430
My son!

325
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,150
How could you leave me,

326
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,040
your mother like this?

327
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,110
My son...

328
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,770
My son!

329
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,030
Son, what happened to you?

330
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,150
My son...

331
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,760
Ma'am! Ma'am!

332
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,310

Hurry!

336
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,560
Go get a doctor!

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,450
Ma'am...

338
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,190
Cuiying!

339
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,820
Come on, take her back to her room.

340
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,290
Cuiying...

341
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,080
Chief,

342
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,530

Why did you call me so loudly? Almost startled me.

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,160
Ms. Ji Li?

385
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,970
Hello, Miss Duan.

386
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,110
What a coincidence.

387
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,850
What brings you here?

388
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,030
Our dance troupe's invaded by rats.

389
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,430
I came to buy a rat killer.

390
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,910
You even sell that?

391
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,510
Miss Duan,

392
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,940
I have something to attend to. So I'll take my leave.

393
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,560
Chi Xue.

394
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,120
What did that woman just buy?

395
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,980
Rat killer.

396
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,490
Anything else?

397
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,040
And a bottle of insect oil.

398
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,000
What's insect oil?

399
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,120
You have something to do with it?

400
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,530
Another person died on North Street this morning.

401
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,640
The victim was

402
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,600
a young scholar.

403
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,350
After his sudden death,

404
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,210
he turned into a middle-aged man.

405
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,480
That woman you saw just now

406
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,280
was there mourning the deceased.

407
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,880
I guess they knew each other.

408
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,710
But I can't help feeling that

409
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,570
this whole thing is kind of fishy.

410
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,800
Insect oil is used to ward off evil things.

411
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,080
When applied to a sharp weapon,

412
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,320
it can cause damage to a demon's spiritual body.

413
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,580
If it hits a vital spot,

414
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,260
it can certainly be fatal.

415
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,090
Now it all makes sense.

416
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,560
That woman

417
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
must know the whereabouts of the demon.

418
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,390
Where is she?

419
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
She once said

420
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,190
they were from the Yunmen Dance Troupe.

421
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,890
Yunmen Dance Troupe?

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,280
The one who died at Yanlai Restaurant last time,

423
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,740
the dancer named Tian Rui,

424
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,030
was also one of the Yunmen Dance Troupe.

425
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,430
Let's go find her.

426
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
Didn't the previous victims

427
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,800
all age abnormally when they died?

428
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,590
Why did the victim

429
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,190
turn middle-aged this time?

430
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,040
Didn't Physician Jiu mention that

431
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,240
it'd take seven full days

432
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,960
for a jade pear

433
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,620
to fully absorb the life force

434
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,320
of the host eating the pear?

435
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,280
I guess this time, that demon took out the pear

436
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,570
before the time was up.

437
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,130
Am I right, Physician Jiu?

438
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,000
Maybe.

439
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,000
Then why would he do this?

440
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,340
Guess he messed up the timing.

441
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,480
Messed up the timing

442
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,080
of things like this? Really?

443
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,620
Well, demons

444
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,040
are all about murdering humans

445
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,100
and are quite dumb.

446
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,010
What's so surprising about that?

447
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,590
Could that be the truth?

448
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,940
Or maybe he just couldn't wait

449
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,680
to kill that man on the spot.

450
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,740
Chief Constable Chu.

451
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,240
Banxia?

452
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,530
What brings you here?

453
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,490
We're here to find Ms. Ji Li.

454
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,460
She's left.

455
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,690
What? Where did she go?

456
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,620
She bid farewell to the Manager yesterday,

457
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,130
saying she'd be heading south.

458
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,390
And she's already left the Dance Troupe.

459
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,910
How long has it been

460
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,110
since we last sat down

461
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,640
and had a proper meal together like this?

462
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,350
Whenever you visited,

463
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,210
you made me eat those jade pears

464
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,150
with a fishy smell

465
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,540
and an awful taste.

466
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,110
As time went by,

467
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,170
I'd recall that fishiness

468
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,830
at the sight of you every time.

469
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,340
That's why I keep quarreling with you.

470
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,690
Thinking about it now,

471
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,320
I really shouldn't have acted this way.

472
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,290
Today on the street,

473
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,170
I ran into a woman in her sixties,

474
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,630
gray-haired

475
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,910
and wrinkled.

476
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,950
Just one look

477
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,630
and it was terrifying.

478
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,180
A woman's youth

479
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,800
is rather fleeting.

480
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,460
Only about one or two decades.

481
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,000
Just like a flower,

482
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,490
before you can even appreciate it,

483
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
it withers.

484
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,070
What a pity.

485
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,700
But luckily,

486
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,760
I have you.

487
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,700
You love me, spoil me,

488
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,640
and make jade pears for me,

489
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,010
helping me stay young for 20 years.

490
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,370
This is something

491
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,900
countless people dream of.

492
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,110
Yet I was ungrateful,

493
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
quarreling with you,

494
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,390
saying things that hurt you,

495
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,350
and doing things you hated.

496
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,840
Thinking about it now,

497
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,060
I was really rebellious.

498
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
I never blame you.

499
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,030
Really?

500
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,670
Really.

501
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,520
Chuan,

502
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,270
thank you.

503
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,560
Li,

504
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,630
don't cry.

505
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,790
Let bygones

506
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,460
be bygones.

507
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,680
As long as we can

508
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,010
stay together forever,

509
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,180
nothing else matters.

510
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,240
I've made up my mind.

511
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,760
When we leave this place

512
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,300
and reach Jiangnan,

513
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,390
let's find a nice place with mountains

514
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,670
and water.

515
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,640
I don't want to be in the public eye anymore.

516
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,950
I just want to be with you,

517
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,200
do the washing and cooking,

518
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,350
play music and dance,

519
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,320
and never see anyone else again.

520
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,450
How does that sound?

521
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,880
I've been looking forward to that kind of life

522
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,830
for years.

523
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,390
I've also been looking forward to that kind of life

524
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,280
for a long time.

525
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,430
Do you have to do this?

526
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,480
How many times has this happened?

527
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,940
Do you really want me dead?

528
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,590
I've been so good to you,

529
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,340
yet you betrayed me

530
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,100
and had an affair with someone else.

531
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,360
I don't even blame you!

532
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,909
You've really disappointed me.

533
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,230
Sirs and madam, are you here to book some rooms?

534
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,480
We're here on official business.

535
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,139
Yes, sir.

536
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,670
Have you seen a girl

537
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,250
around 17 or 18,

538
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,230
slender in build,

539
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,360
with deep-set eyes?

540
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,610
She should have come alone.

541
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,440
No.

542
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,230
Please try to recall again.

543
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,920
She's very fair-skinned, thin,

544
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,050
and pretty.

545
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,179
It really doesn't ring a bell.

546
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,520
Sir,

547
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,750
I think I've seen

548
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,210
the person you described.

549
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,989
Where is she?

550
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,080
Upstairs, in the second room from the left.

551
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,940
That girl looks

552
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,190
like she stepped out of a painting.

553
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,449
Her waist is very slim.

554
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,440
I heard from some other guests that

555
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,640
he's a dancer from Yunmen Dance Troupe.

556
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,840
What kind of place is this?

557
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,410
Are you playing tricks again?

558
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,570
Yeah,

559
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,590
I forgot that

560
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,100
you don't remember anything.

561
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,960
Let me help you recall it.

562
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,620
Back then,

563
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,750
you were sold to the mansion as a dancer.

564
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,300
At first, you led

565
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,330
a pretty good life.

566
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,940
But as time went by,

567
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,170
you grew older,

568
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,720
losing your youthful charm

569
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,480
and favor.

570
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,270
Even the servants in the mansion

571
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,300
could bully you at will

572
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,340
and treat you like a toy.

573
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,820
You were resentful.

574
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,520
Day and night, you made wishes in front of the mirror,

575
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,480
hoping to regain your youth.

576
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,900
I

577
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,480
heard your voice

578
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,980
and came to you

579
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,970
to fulfill your wish.

580
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,090
Not only did you regain your beauty,

581
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,700
but I also helped you take revenge

582
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,230
by killing those who once hurt you.

583
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,970
You're talking nonsense!

584
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm talking nonsense?

585
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,980
Mirrors

586
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,210
actually reflect

587
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,170
human hearts.

588
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,270
Greed

589
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,520
comes at a price.

590
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,000
Look at your face.

591
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,630
So young,

592
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,890
so radiant.

593
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,950
How gorgeous.

594
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,430
It's taken numerous human lives

595
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,750
to maintain such a beautiful face.

596
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,650
Over these years,

597
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,010
how many people have you killed?

598
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,210
That bookworm,

599
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,210
if he knew that

600
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,690
your beauty

601
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,090
is backed by so much bloodshed,

602
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,030
would he still love you?

603
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,110
Would he?

604
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,870
Would he really?

605
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,930
I didn't do that!

606
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,690
You didn't?

607
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,690
What do you mean?

608
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,280
Didn't kill with your own hands?

609
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,970
Or didn't harm any lives?

610
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,850
Don't tell me

611
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,160
you have no idea how this pear

612
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,590
is made.

613
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:04,610
Li,

614
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,290
come on...

615
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,900
That's too hypocritical.

616
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,890
I tried to kill myself.

617
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,450
I once tried to kill myself.

618
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:16,850
Right!

619
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,230
I attempted that!

620
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,260
You didn't allow it.

621
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,440
You stopped me!

622
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,320
If you really wanted to die,

623
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,970
could I have kept an eye on you day and night?

624
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,460
The path

625
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,780
is yours to walk on your own.

626
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,280
Is it so hard to admit that

627
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
you're a cruel,

628
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,990
cold-blooded creature?

629
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,620
You're truly a devil.

630
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,850
It was you.

631
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,440
You deceived me.

632
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,880
You beguiled me into eating the pears,

633
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,020
saying they'd keep me young

634
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,080
and alive forever!

635
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,080
You deceived me,

636
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,840
turning me into

637
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,310
a monster like you!

638
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,200
Li,

639
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,740
people

640
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,170
can't have everything they ask for.

641
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,710
I just want to leave you.

642
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,590
What did you say?

643
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,400
I don't know why

644
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,040
I met you.

645
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,550
You must have bewitched me.

646
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,360
I never want to eat those

647
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,010
stinking, fishy pears again.

648
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,560
I only want to stay with the person

649
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,190
I love!

650
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,900
Dream on!

651
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,740
Having drained people's blood

652
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,340
and reaped all the benefits,

653
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,440
you still dream about

654
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,640
living a normal life?

655
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,480
I'd rather die

656
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,850
than live with you.

657
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,330
They called you promiscuous,

658
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
obsessed with seducing men,

659
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,360
born with no shame.

660
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,610
I don't believe it.

661
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,590
I don't!

662
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
I love you deeply.

663
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,150
Have you forgotten that?

664
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
You're a demon!

665
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,830
You're not human.

666
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,960
Do you know what love is?

667
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,690
Do you understand it at all?

668
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,440
Every moment

669
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,380
with you,

670
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,670
I hate myself.

671
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,660
This isn't love at all.

672
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,020
You don't deserve to talk about love!

673
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,220
I don't deserve that?

674
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,300
You're my one and only love

675
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,530
in my whole life!

676
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,590
What? I don't deserve it?

677
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,090
Do you think you deserve it?

678
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,900
No!

679
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,680
I've destroyed myself with my own hands.

680
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,440
I hate you.

681
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,340
And I hate myself even more.

682
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,360
They were right.

683
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,380
I am promiscuous,

684
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,570
obsessed with seducing men,

685
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,870
born with no shame.

686
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,670
I can be

687
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,130
with anyone.

688
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,190
Literally anyone!

689
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,190
Except you.

690
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,290
I'd rather age and die

691
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,630
than be with you!

692
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,830
Don't talk like that!

693
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,790
I knew it.

694
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,210
You think

695
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,240
after all these years,

696
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
this is really the first time

697
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
you've fallen in love with someone?

698
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,930
You think we've only been together

699
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,220
for 20 years?

700
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,150
What do you mean by that?

701
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,020
It'll be okay.

702
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,550
Don't be afraid.

703
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,630
After today,

704
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,670
we can be back to how we used to be.

705
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,080
Don't touch me!
