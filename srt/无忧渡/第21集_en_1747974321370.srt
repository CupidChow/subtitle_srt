Why

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
me

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
The new Oppo Fund X8 series invites you to watch the show.

Episode 2

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,800
He's always been like this. Don't be mad at him.

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,960
It's a shame he kept trying to break your case.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Today, he's really a dead man.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Big brother, big sister-in-law.

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
You're so handsome this morning.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Big brother, you're really good.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Good taste.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I have something to do.

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
You guys watch the young master of the royal family.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Don't let him run away.

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Big brother, run.

54
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Shut up.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Big brother, don't worry.

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Let's go.

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Where are we going now?

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480
There are only three places left in Guangping.

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
The marriage valley is the closest to us.

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Let's go there first.

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Okay.

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
This is it.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
This is the marriage valley?

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
It doesn't look special.

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
In this world, most of the famous and famous scenic spots

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
are not special.

67
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,480
What makes them famous is the story behind them.

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
It's said that there was a war in the previous dynasty.

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
The most beloved imperial concubine of the emperor

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
escaped from the palace and came here.

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
On the way, she met a man who was a traitor.

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
She was a ghost.

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
The imperial concubine was very loyal and ungrateful.

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
She was willing to die under the tree.

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
In order to pay her respects,

76
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
the emperor ordered her to plant a tree here.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
She and the tree were together and protected each other.

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,480
The two trees were together and the two trees were together.

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
They were together all night.

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,480
The people thought that the friendship between the emperor and the imperial concubine

81
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
moved the upper class.

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
So they named it the marriage tree.

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
It's very beautiful.

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
I didn't expect that

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
there was such a regretful place

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,480
where the emperor wanted to marry.

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,480
The imperial concubine is really loyal and ungrateful.

88
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
You admire her.

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Don't you?

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I don't know.

91
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,480
I only know that life is very precious.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
No matter what happens,

93
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
no matter what problems you encounter,

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,480
you shouldn't give up your life so easily.

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Why are you so familiar with this place?

96
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
This is Guangping City.

97
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,480
I grew up here. Of course I'm familiar with it.

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Have you been here with others?

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,480
I mean, have you ever asked for a marriage here?

100
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
No.

101
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
That's good.

102
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
What is this?

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
This is a wish card.

104
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
It's used to make a wish.

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Do you want to make a wish?

106
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
The whole world is fake.

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Can the wish made by the wish come true?

108
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
It doesn't matter if you try.

109
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Here.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
What should I do, Xueyan?

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I've made others' wishes come true.

113
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
How can I hang it back?

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Where should I hang it?

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Xia.

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Duan Yinghang.

117
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
This is my father's handwriting.

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
It means he's also in this painting.

119
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Right. And Xueyan, look.

120
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
He remembers his own name, Duan Yinghang.

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Does it mean that he's also in this painting like us?

122
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
He's still here, right?

123
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm finally going to find him.

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Are you here to ask for a marriage?

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Little Taoist.

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Have you seen this person?

127
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
His name is Duan Yinghang.

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Duan Yinghang?

129
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
No.

130
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Right.

131
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
There are so many people. How can you remember them?

132
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Little Taoist, which Taoist temple are you from?

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Me?

134
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Lushan Anxing Temple.

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
It might be from Puti Temple.

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Puti Temple?

137
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Sanqing Temple is Sanqing Temple.

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Why is it Puti Temple?

139
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Because I had a dream today.

140
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,480
In my dream, I was a disciple of Puti Mountain, Puti Temple, and Puti True Man.

141
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,480
That day, my master Puti True Man went to Mount Fanyuan

142
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
to drink the 90th birthday wine of the true master of the Fanyuan Sect.

143
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
He went there for a year.

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I missed my master, so I went down the mountain to find him.

145
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
But I just arrived in Guangping City, and I had no money left.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,480
So I had to go to the city to make up for my loss.

147
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
You're dreaming.

148
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
It's a dream, but it's not a dream.

149
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,480
It's like dreaming in a dream.

150
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
If this is really a dream,

151
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
do you want to be a little Taoist with three relatives?

152
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Or a little disciple of Puti Temple?

153
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
It doesn't matter who it is.

154
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I just want to go to Mount Fanyuan and get the True Man.

155
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Since it's a dream,

156
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,480
how can you distinguish between true and false?

157
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
If you're really dreaming, then you're not real.

158
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
The little Taoist speaks very well.

159
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I'll take it.

160
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
I dare not.

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Two bottles of wine.

162
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Can you open a chapter for me?

163
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Is this enough?

164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Master, this bracelet is enough for me to count a hundred times.

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
What I want to count is this price.

166
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
May I ask why you want it?

167
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I want to be lucky.

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Here.

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
This is a thousand-dollar box.

170
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
It's a gift from the forest.

171
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
You'll know what's inside.

172
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
You'll know it's hidden inside.

173
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
When you're in the shadow,

174
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
a sound will come out.

175
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
When you're in the abyss,

176
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
the person who's gone will come to you.

177
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Thank you, little Taoist.

178
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you have any requests?

179
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
No.

180
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
I have a marriage tree here.

181
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
I'll make a marriage for you.

182
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Please.

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
The mirror breaks, the wind blows.

184
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
The water is silent.

185
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
The bear is here.

186
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Don't take what that little Taoist said to heart.

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
He's young and weak.

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
It's not a good thing.

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Let's not talk about him.

190
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,480
It's a great achievement to have found your father's handwriting.

191
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes.

192
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
As long as we can find him in the painting,

193
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
it's just a matter of time.

194
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
There are two more places that will have a clue.

195
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
If we can find a way out,

196
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
will the other people trapped in the painting

197
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
also be able to escape?

198
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Then that little Taoist can go back to the Bodhi Temple

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
and find his master.

200
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Actually,

201
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
sixty years ago,

202
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
a mountain fire broke out in the Bodhi Mountain.

203
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,480
His master and the entire Taoist temple

204
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
had already turned into a rock

205
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
and dissipated.

206
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
For sixty years,

207
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
he was completely worthless.

208
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
He was too young to be a master.

209
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
I think he had been in the painting for a long time.

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,480
The world in the painting is repeating itself.

211
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,480
But the time outside is running out.

212
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Once this place collapses,

213
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
he will become old in an instant.

214
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
One child will become an old man.

215
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
If that's the case,

216
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I don't know if it's better to stay here

217
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
or to escape.

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
If he stays here,

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
at least he will have hope and hope every day.

220
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,480
But if he really escapes,

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
even if he has a dream and has not experienced anything,

222
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,480
his life will come to an end.

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Little sister.

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Go and inform Master.

225
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Okay.

226
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Go.

227
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
The incense burner in the temple is too old.

228
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Your Majesty is blessed.

229
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Besides, there used to be a miracle here.

230
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
So there are more people here.

231
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
What miracle?

232
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
In the past, the Great Han Dynasty was in a state of poverty.

233
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
The rain did not fall for four months in a row.

234
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
The people were in a difficult situation.

235
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
The woman in the temple led by the Grand Tutor

236
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,480
came to the temple to pray for rain on the day of the festival.

237
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,480
The magic was always shaking at first.

238
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,480
But when the rain stopped,

239
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,480
the great rain began.

240
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,480
After the rain, the flowers bloomed.

241
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
The people thought it was the mercy of the Great God

242
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
that brought down the drought.

243
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,480
So they decided to hold the festival as a temple.

244
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,480
The good men and women will come to the temple

245
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
to pray for rain on this day.

246
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I see.

247
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,480
But it's not a good idea to keep looking for it.

248
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Since my father remembers his name,

249
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
he should remember my voice.

250
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Let's shout.

251
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
If he hears it, he will respond, right?

252
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
It should be like this.

253
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Hurry, go after him.

254
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Hurry, go.

255
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Master.

256
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Father!

257
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm Fan Xia. Where are you?

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Father!

259
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Master, it's the sound of the Junior Sister.

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Hurry, find her.

261
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Father.

262
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I forgot I was going back to the Palace.

263
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
You bastard!

264
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Father?

265
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
I don't have a daughter like you.

266
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Is this your father?

267
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
He's not my father.

268
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's go.

269
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Hurry.

270
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Stop!

271
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Stop!

272
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Stop!

273
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
This way.

274
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
This way.

275
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
This way.

276
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
This way!

277
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
This way.

278
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Let's go to the east.

279
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
This way.

280
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
This way.

281
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Master!

282
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Did you find her?

283
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
We searched the yard, but we didn't find her.

284
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
There's no one here either.

285
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
How is that possible?

286
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
She was in the courtyard.

287
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Let's go.

288
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Why are you running?

289
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Are they chasing me?

290
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,480
You're a powerful martial artist. You can't just run away.

291
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
That's my father.

292
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Father in the painting.

293
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
That's my father.

294
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Master!

295
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
How is it?

296
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
There's no way out.

297
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Impossible. She must be in the courtyard.

298
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
There's no way out. There's only one hole left.

299
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Nonsense!

300
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
How can my daughter walk through a hole?

301
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Let's go. Hurry.

302
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Yes.

303
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Let's go.

304
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Hurry.

305
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Hurry. Hide.

306
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
What's going on?

307
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I don't believe it.

308
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Let's go.

309
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Hey.

310
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
They're all gone.

311
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Can you let me go?

312
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
No.

313
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
What if they come back?

314
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Can't you just step back?

315
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
You have so much space left.

316
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
I'll go and get you.

317
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
No.

318
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
I'll step back a little bit. They'll see.

319
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Hold on a little longer.

320
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
I'll go.

321
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I don't know where they are.

322
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
I know. Let's go.

323
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Hurry.

324
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Hurry.

325
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Did you remember everything?

326
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Yes.

327
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,480
The universe is in chaos.

328
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,480
The sun rises in the east.

329
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
The moon is in the west.

330
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
You're so angry.

331
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Let's hear it again.

332
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,480
The universe is in chaos.

333
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Say it.

334
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,480
The universe is in chaos.

335
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
The universe is in chaos.

336
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
I've told you so many times.

337
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Why can't you remember it?

338
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Let me ask you.

339
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
What's your mother's name?

340
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Hong Ning.

341
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
That's right.

342
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
The universe is in chaos.

343
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Your mother is in chaos.

344
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,480
The universe is in chaos.

345
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,480
The universe is in chaos.

346
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
What are you memorizing?

347
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Mom.

348
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
You're almost done.

349
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
You're too late to come back.

350
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
You sound so angry.

351
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Didn't you hear what she said?

352
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
You pretend to go to school all day.

353
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
And you learned all this?

354
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
You're so annoying.

355
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
I don't usually see you taking care of the kids.

356
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
You're so annoying.

357
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
You're so annoying.

358
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
You're so annoying.

359
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Let's go.

360
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I'll cook you something delicious.

361
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
I'll cook you something delicious.

362
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Hong Ning.

363
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Enough.

364
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Hong Ning.

365
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
The universe is in chaos.

366
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
The universe is in chaos.

367
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
The universe is in chaos.

368
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
The universe is in chaos.

369
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Are you going to see a doctor?

370
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Are you going to see a doctor?

371
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm here to see a doctor.

372
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Little brother.

373
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Do you have any eye disease?

374
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Go back.

375
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Go back.

376
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
I'm sick.

377
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
What's your symptom?

378
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
I haven't eaten much recently.

379
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I'm dizzy and nervous.

380
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
I'm dizzy and nervous.

381
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm still...

382
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
You can't eat?

383
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
You're nervous and dizzy?

384
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Yes.

385
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
You shouldn't.

386
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Little girl.

387
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
I see your pulse is strong,

388
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
steady and stable.

389
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
I think it's a chain.

390
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
I really can't see

391
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
any symptoms.

392
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Did you two

393
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
get the money from the Changping Hospital

394
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
to make trouble for me?

395
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
No. I really came to see a doctor.

396
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I can't sleep at night.

397
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I have a headache.

398
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
I've seen many

399
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
hospitals that don't work.

400
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
They say you're good at medicine.

401
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
So I want you to open a prescription.

402
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Okay. I'll give you

403
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
a prescription for sleeping.

404
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay.

405
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Here.

406
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Remember.

407
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Slow down.

408
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Take three bowls of water

409
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
and one bowl of food.

410
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Then you can take it.

411
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Don't eat too much

412
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
every day.

413
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Here.

414
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
This is the money.

415
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
It's too expensive.

416
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
No need.

417
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Here.

418
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I'll make it up next time.

419
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Okay.

420
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Go and give him the medicine.

421
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
What else do you want to see?

422
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
I want to buy some medicine.

423
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
What medicine?

424
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Thunder, sand, wind,

425
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
moon, oil,

426
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
charcoal, incense, ash.

427
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Okay.

428
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Thunder, sand, wind,

429
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
charcoal, ash, ash, ash.

430
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
They're all here.

431
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
But the moon,

432
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
oil, and charcoal,

433
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
I've never heard of.

434
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
Never heard of?

435
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Little brother,

436
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
what is this moon?

437
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
It's also a kind of charcoal.

438
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Do you have any more?

439
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Can I see?

440
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
I don't have any.

441
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I bought it from you.

442
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I didn't expect

443
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
that little brother

444
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
is so young

445
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
to be a middle-class man.

446
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
What kind of family are you?

447
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
I'm resting with my father.

448
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
That's great.

449
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
You're a rich man.

450
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
May I ask your name?

451
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Your name is not important.

452
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I may know you.

453
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
You won't know him.

454
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
He's already dead.

455
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm sorry.

456
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
He's his father.

457
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
The meal is ready.

458
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Let's eat.

459
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
We won't bother you.

460
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Goodbye.

461
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Goodbye.

462
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Let's go.

463
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
What's wrong?

464
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
It hurts.

465
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
I don't know if it's because

466
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
I haven't eaten for a long time.

467
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Madam,

468
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I'll have a meal at your house.

469
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Is it troublesome?

470
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
Of course.

471
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
It's okay. Let's eat together.

472
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Let's eat together.

473
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm sorry to bother you.

474
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
It's okay.

475
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Let's go.

476
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Come on.

477
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Sit down.

478
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Okay. I'm hungry.

479
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
It's a family meal.

480
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Please don't mind.

481
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Let's eat.

482
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Is it not good?

483
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Is it good?

484
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
It's delicious.

485
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
This is my own pickle.

486
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
I don't think it suits your taste.

487
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Come on.

488
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Have a chicken leg.

489
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
I bought it in the rice shop.

490
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
It's delicious.

491
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
When I was a kid,

492
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
my mother made me pickle.

493
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Since she passed away,

494
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
I haven't tasted it.

495
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Is that so?

496
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
If you like it, eat more.

497
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
There's more in the kitchen.

498
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
If you don't mind,

499
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
wear some more when you leave.

500
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Brother,

501
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
take them all.

502
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
I don't like them either.

503
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
He's so smart and cute.

504
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
He'll be very successful in the future.

505
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
I don't need to be very successful.

506
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I have no expectations for this brat.

507
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
As long as he can pass on this sugar,

508
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I'll be able to catch the demon.

509
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I'll be able to catch the demon.

510
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
You're a lucky man.

511
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Don't say you'll pass on this sugar.

512
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Maybe you'll be able to

513
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
catch the demon in the future.

514
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
You're a good talker.

515
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
If you really do what you say,

516
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
I'll be laughing in my dreams.

517
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
If you laugh, I'll cry.

518
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
I work in this industry

519
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
and fight against the demons.

520
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
I don't want my son to do this.

521
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
I don't want my son to do this.

522
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
As long as we're together,

523
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
we'll be safe and sound.

524
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
It's better than anything else.

525
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
You just got married, right?

526
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
We're not husband and wife.

527
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
We're just friends.

528
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Don't try to coax me.

529
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
I can tell.

530
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
What can you tell?

531
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I can tell that you two

532
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
are a couple.

533
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Anyway, you must like him.

534
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Then we came out of the South Sea.

535
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
He's a nice guy.

536
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
I can tell.

537
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
You've been to the South Sea?

538
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
My father took me there.

539
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
There's a demon in the South Sea

540
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
called the Lava.

541
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
It's huge and huge.

542
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
It's the best at making up

543
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
and seducing people.

544
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
When my father and I first met

545
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
this demon, we found its path

546
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
and fell into the illusion.

547
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
We almost lost our minds.

548
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
But it's okay.

549
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
My father woke up and

550
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
took the demon out.

551
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,480
The illusion of the world

552
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
is very mysterious

553
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
and very mysterious.

554
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
But it's always there.

555
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
As long as you find the right eye,

556
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
you can break it.

557
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
People are trapped in the illusion.

558
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
They're like the edge of a dream.

559
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Birds in the cage are hard to break.

560
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
But from the outside,

561
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
they're like flowers in the mirror.

562
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
They're like the shadow in the water.

563
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
They're like bubbles

564
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
in the water.

565
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
So you mean

566
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
to break the illusion,

567
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
you need to be under surveillance?

568
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Yes.

569
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
There are two types of eye.

570
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
One is connected to the door

571
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
between the illusion.

572
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
You can escape from the illusion

573
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
by passing through it.

574
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
The other type is the one who loses his mind.

575
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Once he dies,

576
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
the illusion will disappear.

577
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Grandpa, look.

578
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:36,180
I know how to play the

579
00:30:45,480 --> 00:31:01,180
music.

580
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
You're in a good mood today.

581
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
I played a set of boxing.

582
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
I feel much better.

583
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Why is your parents

584
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
also in the painting?

585
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
That demon should be

586
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
painting this painting for many years.

587
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
He can paint whatever he sees.

588
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
For example,

589
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:40,120
the six

590
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
paintings.

591
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
The painter himself

592
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
can get the answer.

593
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Let's go.

594
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Let's go.

595
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Let's go.

596
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Sir, please line up behind him.

597
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
I want to see your steward.

598
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
I'm here to investigate

599
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
the missing case of

600
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
King Xianan.

601
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
As the underground city,

602
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
you've been in the business for a long time.

603
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Could you help me?

604
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
I'll help you.

605
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
I'm willing to help you.

606
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
But I don't know

607
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
where you can find the clues.

608
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Two years ago,

609
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
King Xianan came to the underground city

610
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
with his wife.

611
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
He went to the real estate

612
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
to see a doctor.

613
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
He was diagnosed with

614
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
a blood disease

615
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
and died.

616
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
But after that,

617
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
he didn't return to the capital.

618
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
He disappeared in the underground city.

619
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Sir,

620
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
please forgive me.

621
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
Since he's in a critical condition,

622
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
and it's been two years,

623
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
even if he's found,

624
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
he'll be in danger.

625
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Don't worry about it.

626
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
You know who King Xianan is.

627
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Even if he doesn't believe it,

628
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I'll find out the truth.

629
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Well...

630
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
What?

631
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
You don't want to do it?

632
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm not.

633
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm trying to figure out a way.

634
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I don't know

635
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
if you have a letter of?

636
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
If you do,

637
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
I'll ask the other businessmen

638
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
to do it together.

639
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,120
It'll be faster.

640
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
You think I'm not a big person.

641
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I dare not.

642
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Are you a big person?

643
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Big person?

644
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,120
I'll cut the crap.

645
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
The one who came with me

646
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
is another agent.

647
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
To be honest,

648
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
he's the future son of the head of the department.

649
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
If anything happens,

650
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
don't say you can't afford it.

651
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Even your master

652
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
can't afford it.

653
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Who is the head of the department?

654
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Is that something you can ask?

655
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
First, it's a prince.

656
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Then, it's the son of the head of the department.

657
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
I can ask Mr. Song.

658
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
But...

659
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm afraid it's not the letter.

660
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,120
It's the officer.

661
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
By then,

662
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
the underground city will be searched.

663
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
If it affects your business,

664
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
don't blame me for not reminding you.

665
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Thank you for reminding me.

666
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,120
The son of the head of the department?

667
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Yes.

668
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I don't know which one

669
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
he's talking about.

670
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
What's his last name?

671
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Si Ma.

672
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Si Ma?

673
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Interesting.

674
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
The opening of the door

675
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
is getting closer.

676
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
The underground city

677
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
is getting more and more lively.

678
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I see.

679
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Master,

680
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
do you need help?

681
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Of course.

682
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Chun Min,

683
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
send more people to help him.

684
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
When he's done,

685
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
he'll leave.

686
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,120
Let him leave.

687
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Yes.

688
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
You said you've read books

689
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,120
at Dexun Academy?

690
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
How is that possible?

691
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,120
There's a famous library.

692
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
How could you take me in?

693
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
What about that Zhang Fu Zi?

694
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
There's no Zhang Fu Zi.

695
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
I was just saying.

696
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Besides,

697
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
they took your bracelet.

698
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Even if I say we're from anywhere,

699
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
they'll let us try it first.

700
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
That's right.

701
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm not sure.

702
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Let's try it.

703
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
That's right.

704
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
This is the last stop

705
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
in Guangping.

706
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
But why is Nanhu Night Banquet

707
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
also one stop?

708
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
It's said that

709
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
King Xin An is the current emperor's uncle.

710
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
When they came here,

711
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
they found that this place

712
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
is a place of the human world.

713
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
So they held a banquet

714
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,120
for the students of the Han Sect.

715
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,120
As long as the poems are written,

716
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
King Xin An can drink and celebrate.

717
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Moreover,

718
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
the four-year imperial examination can be awarded.

719
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,120
So it became the first stop in Guangping.

720
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Will you kiss me?

721
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

722
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
I'm Liu Kuo.

723
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
I'm a rich man.

724
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Nice to meet you.

725
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,120
What's your name?

726
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
My surname is Jiu.

727
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Duan Yan Qiu.

728
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Duan Xiong. Jiu Xiu.

729
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,120
I wonder where you're from.

730
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Which school do you study in?

731
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
We're from Guangping.

732
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
We're from De Xin School.

733
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
De Xin School?

734
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
We're from the same school.

735
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
No wonder you look so familiar.

736
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Which teacher do you study?

737
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Master Zhang.

738
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Master Zhang?

739
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Zhang Maosong?

740
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Yes.

741
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
But Master Zhang,

742
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
you've been friends for a long time.

743
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,120
We're the students of Ta Qian.

744
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Ta Qian?

745
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm from Guoluo.

746
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I only listen to the official students.

747
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Brother Liu,

748
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
how long has it been since the last time?

749
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
It's been a few years.

750
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
You can do things?

751
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Nanhu Night Banquet

752
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
was a few years ago, right?

753
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Yes.

754
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
It's been a decade

755
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
and I still can't forget it.

756
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
I've never tried it before,

757
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
but I'm sure I can remember it.

758
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,120
And they've never heard it before.

759
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Come on.

760
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Why are you out?

761
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
I...

762
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
I'll fight you!

763
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Come on.

764
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Today,

765
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
even if we turn Guangping City upside down,

766
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,120
we have to find those two people!

767
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Yes!

768
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm here to thank the new gang

769
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
for their goodwill.

770
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
This is a gift from the King.

771
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
I hope you'll keep it in mind.

772
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,120
We'll keep it in mind.

773
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Your Highness.

774
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Do you think there's a painter here?

775
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Very likely.

776
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
This is the scene, this is the heart, this is the expression.

777
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,120
I'd like to give you

778
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,120
a gift from the King.

779
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
A gift for you all.

780
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Ten years of cold and cold,

781
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,120
rain and lightning.

782
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
White and red,

783
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,120
the sound of the flute.

784
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Thousands of turns,

785
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
the clouds and clouds,

786
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
ten thousand miles,

787
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,120
the sun and the sun, the red.

788
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Great!

789
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,120
It's great!

790
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,120
It's great!

791
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
You're really talented.

792
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,120
These are just small skills.

793
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,120
I'm not that talented.

794
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,120
For example, this Duan Xiong,

795
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,120
although he's young,

796
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,120
he's a great painter.

797
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
He's better than me.

798
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Me?

799
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Yes.

800
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,120
I saw Duan Xiong just now

801
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
painting and painting.

802
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
He's very talented.

803
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
I'm flattered.

804
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Why do you have to sign it?

805
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Today, the King is here,

806
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,120
why don't you do it again?

807
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Yes, why do you have to sign it?

808
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
Do it again!

809
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
The King is here.

810
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,120
Why don't you do it again?

811
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Do it again!

812
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Why don't you do it again?

813
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,120
Why don't you do it again?

814
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Why don't you do it again?

815
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Why don't you do it again?

816
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Why don't you do it again?

817
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Why don't you do it again?

818
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,120
Why don't you do it again?

819
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Why don't you do it again?

820
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,120
Why don't you do it again?

821
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Why don't you do it again?

822
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
Why don't you do it again?

823
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,120
No need to say more

824
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
I've been smiling

825
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,120
The scenery is like the end of time

826
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,120
There are people who are willing to be silent

827
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,120
Take the head and the ears and the ears

828
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,120
It's good to be together

829
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
The winter moon is unchanging

830
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,120
The tenderness will be in front of me

831
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,120
I'm willing to be with you

832
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,120
The blue heart is fresh

833
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,120
Ten good people meet three bad people

834
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,120
I'm willing to meet you

835
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,120
When the heart is sick

836
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,120
I just hope to be with you

837
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,120
The old spring is hiding the cold

838
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,120
Suddenly I see you by my side

839
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,120
I'm willing to be with you

840
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,120
I'm willing to be with you

841
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,120
I'm willing to be with you
