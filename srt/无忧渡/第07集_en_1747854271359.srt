You're a trap again.

You're really something.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Take Tingzhuo out.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Here.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't worry.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I've prepared everything.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I won't let him get away this time.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're really here?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have to explain.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's He Feng.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll help you.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He Feng.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's nothing.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just take the medicine.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll give you a prescription.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you, Dr. Jiu.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Miss.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I heard you calling me last night.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But I don't know what happened.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can hear you, but I can't open my ears.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't move.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're possessed by a demon.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That demon was hurt by me.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It won't be able to come back for a while.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just in case,

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the government should immediately report it to the city.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No one can play the game of Zhao Lixian anymore.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're asking us to send a notice like this?

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How can the people of the room think of our government?

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then just buy all the pears.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Who...

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Banxia, come here.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are you doing?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm fine.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I feel like you're going to faint.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you doing?

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Shen Ye.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Banxia, come here.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, what's wrong with you?

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm fine.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm fine.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm fine.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's wrong with you?

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What are you doing?

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That demon hasn't died yet.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's very likely that it will come back.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you're in danger, you have to wake me up.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you can't wake me up,

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
then use this to stab me.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why would I stab you?

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you understand what I just said?

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I understand.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But what's wrong with you?

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm too sleepy.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to sleep.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where are they going?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To sleep.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sleep?

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's not good.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Shen Ye used the sword.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What does the sword have to do with sleep?

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Every time he uses the sword, he gets different reactions.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He can eat with the greedy and sleep with the greedy.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But he can't drag my lady.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This demon is hard to deal with.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who can protect your lady except Shen Ye?

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You Huang, where are you going?

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You Huang, I'm talking to you.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Every time you call me, you always say,

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You Huang, wait for me.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What should I do now?

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What do you mean?

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because of the demon, I don't dare to go home.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's go to the inn.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Shen Ye.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Shen Ye.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm so thirsty.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I want to drink some water.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're shy.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't know how hard it is to be a man and a woman?

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm a person who has been engaged.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If I get pushed out, will you marry me?

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This...

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I said I don't want to...

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This...

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This floor...

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This...

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you doing?

117
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We didn't do anything wrong.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why are you taking our name?

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is what the government bought for you.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can ask for money from the government.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This...

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. Chen, I have some pears to sell at home.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The government can't take it.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You should have said earlier.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You can't leave without sending them to the government.

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes, I'll go get them.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What's wrong?

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That Chinese medicine master is very powerful.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't beat him.

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We can't stay here.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Pack up.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We're leaving the city tonight.

133
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're badly injured.

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We're not here to see you.

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Where else can we go if we're not here?

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can rest here.

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When you're better, we can go back to the factory.

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How's the situation outside?

141
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Everything is normal.

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What's wrong?

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Nothing.

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I thought you wouldn't be able to come tonight.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I have something to do at the workshop.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll wait for my wife.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm willing to wait for her for as long as possible.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Although our marriage is a bit complicated,

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
my father still agreed.

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He also said he would send us a shop.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But the condition is that

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we can't invite friends on the wedding day.

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We can't have a big wedding at home.

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I understand his concern.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He's actually very moved by that shop.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But after thinking about it,

159
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I still refused.

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Because I promised you

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I must prove your name.

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I also want everyone in the city to know

163
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
that you will marry me.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't want to be a burden.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's leave this place together.

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Go to a place where no one knows us.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I still have some savings.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I can keep you warm and cook for you.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
As long as I can be with you,

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
even if it's just a good day for a year,

172
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
my life is worth it.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You don't want to?

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I do.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's my pleasure to have you in my life.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Who are you?

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Who are you?

179
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What do you want?

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't you want to be with him?

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Then be with him forever.

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
A Li.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
A Li.

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What are you doing?

185
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Nothing.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why are you here with the mirror on?

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Didn't we agree that when the mirror is on,

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
it's the time when I'm not convenient?

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Between you and me,

190
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
what else is inconvenient?

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Or

192
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
do you have any secrets that you don't want me to know?

193
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Nothing.

194
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Just some women's affairs.

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why are you here?

196
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I came to send you a gift.

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's washed.

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Eat it.

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Didn't you promise me that

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
you wouldn't kill anyone to get the gift until the time is up?

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's what you said.

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But he made a wish.

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I have to fulfill it.

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't want to eat it.

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A Li, be good.

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't make me angry.

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's good.

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why is there no smell of star in this pear?

209
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I forgot.

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
When this person

211
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
just ate it,

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I couldn't help but do it.

213
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Actually, I was going to wait for seven days.

214
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But I really couldn't help it.

215
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
When I saw his face,

216
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I couldn't wait for him to disappear immediately.

217
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Didn't you people often say

218
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
that you can eat whatever you want?

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The owner of this pear is a scholar.

220
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think

221
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
this pear

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
also has a little bit of the smell of books.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you eat it,

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you will know what kind of wine

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
is in the hand of the person who cut it.

226
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm not sure.

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You will know what it is called

228
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to keep your duty and never leave it.

229
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Anxia.

230
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You're awake.

231
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, Tingzhao and Chi Xue

232
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
went to buy food for me.

233
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Are you hungry?

234
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I cooked porridge.

235
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

236
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Why did you leave?

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Didn't I tell you not to leave me?

238
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I didn't leave Danshan Hall.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I didn't go out.

240
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You slept for three days in a row.

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We were tied up in one place.

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I always have to eat and drink water.

243
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think it's good to wash your face.

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I didn't think it through.

245
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I know you're worried about my safety.

246
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But actually,

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
there's a simpler way

248
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to protect me.

249
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What way?

250
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Draw me a secret weapon.

251
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm afraid

252
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
that monster hasn't been caught yet.

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's done.

255
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Xueyan.

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I see a scar on your chest.

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When did you get hurt?

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I saw it by accident.

259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's scary to see a scar.

260
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't remember.

261
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You don't remember?

262
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That was a puncture wound.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And it was so close to the heart.

264
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It almost died.

265
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
How could you not remember?

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't remember anything from my childhood.

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What are you looking at?

268
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You still have to add some more.

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Xuanye, can I go back and change my clothes?

270
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I haven't changed for three days.

271
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's smelly.

272
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll go back with you after I finish eating.

273
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

274
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

275
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hao, Hao, something bad happened again.

276
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What happened?

277
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Another military case.

278
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The victim is Zhou Jinyuan, 24 years old, a local from Guangming.

279
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
He was found dead this morning.

280
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He's in the same condition as Tianrui.

281
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But the way he looked when he died didn't turn into a dead body.

282
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He's just a little bit older.

283
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Didn't turn into a dead body?

284
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you Chu Putuo?

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yes.

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Stand up and speak.

287
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Zhang is the one who reported the case.

288
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes.

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Mr. Chai, I'm a businessman.

290
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't know how to suppress and crack the case.

291
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They've lived for most of their lives.

292
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I've never seen anything so strange.

293
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Can I see your body?

294
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Mr. Chai, please.

295
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
My son.

296
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
My son.

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You should hold your mother's heart.

298
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Son.

299
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Son.

300
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Son, what's wrong with you?

301
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
My son.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Aunt, aunt.

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Cuiying.

304
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Cuiying.

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Hurry, call the doctor.

306
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Cuiying.

307
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Hurry, call the doctor.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Cuiying.

309
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Uncle, Zhou Jueyang's room is right behind us.

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's go and have a look.

311
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's go and have a look.

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Come on.

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Take it all.

314
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.

315
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Take care.

316
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's hard to think of death, but it's harder to think of speed.

317
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I can't get out of your heart.

318
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Linglong.

319
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I love you.

320
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Because I promised you, I must make you my wife.

321
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I also want everyone in the city to know that you will marry me as your wife.

322
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

323
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I love you.

324
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I love you.

325
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I love you.

326
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I love you.

327
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I love you.

328
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I love you.

329
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

330
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
How could it be so coincidental?

331
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Miss.

332
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Miss.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Miss.

334
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Miss.

335
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Miss.

336
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Miss.

337
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Miss.

338
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Miss.

339
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Miss.

340
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Miss.

341
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Miss.

342
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Miss.

343
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Miss.

344
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Miss.

345
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Why are you shouting? It's scary.

346
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I've been in for a long time.

347
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
What are you thinking about, Miss?

348
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You are so familiar.

349
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm not thinking about anything.

350
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hurry up and clean up.

351
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

352
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You changed your clothes?

353
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I thought about it.

354
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Before you catch Jin Yao, you must stay with me.

355
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Okay.

356
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's go.

357
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What are you doing?

358
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Miss Li.

359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Miss Duan. What a coincidence.

360
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Why are you here?

361
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm a mouse.

362
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm here to buy some medicine.

363
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You're still selling medicine?

364
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Miss Duan.

365
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I have to go.

366
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Shi Xuan.

367
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What did that woman buy?

368
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Medicine.

369
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Anything else?

370
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There's a bottle of Chong You.

371
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What is Chong You?

372
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's about you.

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Someone died this morning.

374
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The deceased was a young scholar.

375
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But he turned into a middle-aged woman after he died.

376
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That woman just questioned the deceased.

377
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I think they know each other.

378
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But I think it's a bit strange.

379
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Chong You is a blood-sucking substance.

380
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's effective in breaking the body of the demon.

381
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's not difficult to kill the demon.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
That's right.

383
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Then your daughter must know where the demon is.

384
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Where is she?

385
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I said they were from the Cloud Gate and the Five Directions.

386
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Cloud Gate and the Five Directions?

387
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The one who died in Yanlai House last time, Tian Rui's henchman,

388
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
is also from the Cloud Gate and the Five Directions.

389
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's go find her.

390
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The deceased was a young scholar.

391
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Why did he turn into a middle-aged woman this time?

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Didn't Dr. Jiu say that

393
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the body of the demon needs to be kept for seven days

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
before it can completely absorb the host's life.

395
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm afraid it's not time yet.

396
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Then the demon will make a reason.

397
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is that right, Dr. Jiu?

398
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Maybe.

399
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Then why did he do that?

400
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You remember the time wrongly.

401
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
How can you remember the time wrongly in such a thing?

402
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The demon only knows to kill people and has no brains.

403
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What's so strange about that?

404
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Is that true?

405
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's also possible that he can't wait

406
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and wants to take that person's life right away.

407
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Chief Chu.

408
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Banxia.

409
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Why are you here?

410
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We're here to find Miss Ji Li.

411
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Sister Ji Li has left.

412
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
She left? Where did she go?

413
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yesterday she told the chief that she was going to the south.

414
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
She has already left the Five Directions.

415
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
How long have we not been like this?

416
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Sit down and have a meal.

417
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Every time you came, you asked me to eat the Jade pear.

418
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There's a smell of star in that pear.

419
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's hard to eat.

420
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
After a long time, every time I see you,

421
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I will remember that smell.

422
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's why I'm arguing with you.

423
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Now I think,

424
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it's really not right.

425
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Today, I met an old lady who was walking around the street.

426
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
She had a thick skin and a cold all over her face.

427
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
At first glance, she looked scary.

428
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
This woman's youth is even shorter.

429
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's only been one or two decades.

430
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
She's like a flower.

431
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
She hasn't had time to appreciate it,

432
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and then she's gone.

433
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What a pity.

434
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But it's okay.

435
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I have you.

436
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You love me and spoil me.

437
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You've been training me to become a Jade pear.

438
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You've been helping me to live a long and happy life.

439
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is something that many people have been dreaming of.

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But I'm not content to argue with you.

441
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I said I would hurt you,

442
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and do things that you don't like.

443
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Now that I think about it,

444
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm really not sensible.

445
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't blame you.

446
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Really?

447
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yes.

448
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Xiao Chuan, thank you.

449
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
A'Li,

450
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
don't cry.

451
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let bygones be bygones.

452
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
As long as we're together,

453
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
nothing else matters.

454
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I've already thought about it.

455
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Once we leave here,

456
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
we'll go to Jiangnan

457
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and look for a place with mountains and water.

458
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll be waiting for you.

459
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't want to see you again.

460
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I just want to be with you,

461
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
wash clothes and cook for you,

462
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and be your wife.

463
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't want to see anyone else again.

464
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay?

465
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I've been looking forward to that kind of life

466
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
for a long time.

467
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I've been looking forward to that kind of life

468
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
for a long time too.

469
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Do you have to do this?

470
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
How many times have I told you?

471
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Do you really want me to die?

472
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm so good to you.

473
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You betrayed me.

474
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't blame you for being in a relationship with someone else.

475
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You've disappointed me.

476
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Sir, do you need electricity?

482
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm from the government.

483
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Officer.

484
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Have you ever seen a girl with a short body

485
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and a deep eye?

486
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
She must be here alone.

487
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I've never seen her.

488
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Think about it.

489
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,400
She's very fair, very thin, and very pretty.

490
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,900
I've never seen her before.

491
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,100
Sir, I think I've seen the person you're talking about.

492
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,200
Where?

493
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,900
The second room on the left.

494
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,800
That girl looks like the person in the painting. She's very sexy.

495
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,100
I heard from other sirs that she's a dancer from Yunmeng Dance House.

496
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,500
Where is this?

497
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,900
What kind of show are you playing?

498
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,700
That's right.

499
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,600
I forgot.

500
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
You don't remember anything.

501
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Let me help you recall it.

502
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,300
Back then, you were sold to the house as a dancer.

503
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,900
Your early days were pretty good.

504
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,500
But gradually, you grew old and lost your youth.

505
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
You lost your love.

506
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,800
Even the servants in the house

507
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,300
could easily bully you and play with you.

508
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,900
You're very unwilling to make a wish in front of the mirror every day.

509
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,300
Hoping to regain your youth.

510
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
It was me.

511
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,700
Hearing your voice,

512
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,300
stepping on your side,

513
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,300
and fulfilling your wish.

514
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,900
You not only care about your beauty,

515
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,300
I also helped you take revenge.

516
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Killing those people who hurt you.

517
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,900
You're talking nonsense!

518
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm talking nonsense?

519
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Mirror.

520
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
The one who finally called me

521
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,300
was Ren Xi.

522
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,100
Greed

523
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,900
is something that has to pay a price.

524
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,300
Look at your face.

525
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,900
How young and how beautiful.

526
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,300
It's really beautiful.

527
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,300
Such a beautiful skin

528
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,700
is used to pay for so many lives.

529
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,300
These past years,

530
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,100
how many people have you killed?

531
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,500
That stupid book.

532
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,300
If it knew your beautiful appearance,

533
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,900
it would have been a dead end.

534
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,300
Will it still love you?

535
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Will it? Will it?

536
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
I didn't!

537
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,700
You didn't?

538
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,500
You didn't do anything?

539
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
You didn't kill anyone?

540
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,900
Or you didn't kill anyone?

541
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,500
Don't tell me

542
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,700
you don't know how Li got here.

543
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,700
Li, don't be like this.

544
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,100
You're too hypocritical.

545
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,100
I died.

546
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,100
I died.

547
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,900
Yes, I died!

548
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,900
You didn't allow it. You stopped me!

549
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,900
If you really want to die,

550
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,100
I can still watch you.

551
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,300
You left on your own.

552
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,500
To admit that you're cruel and cold-blooded,

553
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
is that so hard?

554
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,900
You're such a devil.

555
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,500
It was you. You lied to me.

556
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,900
You lied to me that I could embrace youth and live forever.

557
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,500
You lied to me and made me become a monster like you.

558
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,100
Li,

559
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
people

560
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,900
can't want everything.

561
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,700
I just want to leave you.

562
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,500
What did you say?

563
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,900
I don't know why I met you.

564
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,300
You must have bewitched me.

565
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,900
I don't want to eat that ugly pear anymore.

566
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,100
I just want to be with the person I love.

567
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,500
You're delusional!

568
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,700
After you got the benefits of being a human,

569
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,500
you still want to live the normal life.

570
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,700
I'd rather die than be with you.

571
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,900
They said you're a man of your word.

572
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,900
They said you like to seduce men.

573
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
They said you're born with a bone.

574
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,700
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!

575
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I love you so much.

576
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,900
Have you forgotten?

577
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,500
You monster, you're not human.

578
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,300
Do you know what love is? Do you know love?

579
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,900
Every moment I'm with you, I hate myself.

580
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,900
You're not love at all. You don't deserve to be loved.

581
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,100
I don't deserve it.

582
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,900
I've loved you all my life.

583
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,100
I don't deserve it. Do you deserve it?

584
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
I don't deserve it either.

585
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,500
I don't deserve it either.

586
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,300
I've ruined myself.

587
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,700
I hate you.

588
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,500
I hate myself even more.

589
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,100
They're right. I'm a man of my word.

590
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,300
I love to seduce men.

591
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,100
I can be with anyone. Anyone!

592
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
I can't be with you.

593
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,700
I'd rather die than be with you.

594
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,100
Don't say that!

595
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,100
I knew it.

596
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,500
You think that after so many years,

597
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
you'd really be the first to fall in love with someone else?

598
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,100
You think that after so many years,

599
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,500
we'd be together?

600
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,100
What do you mean by that?

601
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,900
It's okay.

602
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Don't be afraid.

603
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,900
After today,

604
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,100
we can be like before.

605
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Don't touch me!

606
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Don't touch me!

607
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Don't touch me!

608
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Don't touch me!

609
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Don't touch me!

610
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Love and hate are like branches that need to be cut off.

611
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:59,500
It's hard to find a way to make up for the past.

612
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:06,500
The years are long gone.

613
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

614
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:19,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

615
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

616
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

617
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:50,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

618
00:44:50,500 --> 00:45:00,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

619
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,500
I'll have a drink to forget the past.

620
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,500
I will never forget your kindness

621
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I will never forget your kindness

622
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
I will never forget your kindness

623
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I will never forget your kindness

624
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
I will never forget your kindness

625
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
I will never forget your kindness

626
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
I will never forget your kindness

627
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,500
I will never forget your kindness

628
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,500
I will never forget your kindness

629
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,500
I will never forget your kindness
