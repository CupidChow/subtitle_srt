ertos

00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,640
кам

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Sing Ling Boxing

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,420
I'm back

12
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,160
Mister, what's the song title?

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
I've heard it so many times.

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
A poem of a poem.

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
The name is already lost.

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
There's a poem about it.

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Do you want to hear it?

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes.

19
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,160
A young man,

20
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,160
he's a poor man.

21
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,160
A young man,

22
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,160
he's a good man.

23
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,160
He's a good man.

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,160
A man who doesn't know.

25
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,160
A man who doesn't know.

26
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Sir, this song is so nice.

27
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Can you teach me?

28
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
It's a good day in the water.

29
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
It's a good day.

30
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,160
No one can tell that someone else is in the mood.

31
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
That's good.

32
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Plus, there's a magic house.

33
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
It's not a normal time.

34
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Of course, you can't tell.

35
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
By the way,

36
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
the man is here today.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
He's sitting in the corner.

38
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
He thought I didn't notice.

39
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
And he left in a human's memory.

40
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
As you said,

41
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
he's here to watch you.

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Why is he a monster?

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Why is he afraid of a mortal?

44
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
The demon master can't let him

45
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
leave the monster alone.

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,160
He can't force himself to do it.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,160
How long will he have to deal with me?

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
What?

49
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Sir, it's my fault.

50
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm being too harsh.

51
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I don't think he'll give up easily.

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
I'll help you with the water.

53
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Okay.

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Sir, I'll be back.

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Miss Cui!

56
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Stop!

57
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Catch her!

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Sir!

59
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Let go of me!

60
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Sir, don't touch her!

61
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Let go of me!

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
What happened to her?

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
She was caught by a lady.

64
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Let go of me!

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Shen Yi!

66
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Shen Yi, I made it!

67
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
What?

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I... I put the water in the water.

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
The water is in the water.

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Tell me slowly.

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm being serious.

72
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
It's not like what you said.

73
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
You said it wrong last time.

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Do you remember I saw the white fog?

75
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I saw the white fog because I saw it.

76
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
So I saved Miss Cui.

77
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
We were walking on a bridge.

78
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
And Miss Cui was walking on the bridge.

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,160
And a thief came and killed her.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
What's wrong?

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
White fog?

82
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Shen Yi!

83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Shen Yi!

84
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Shen Yi!

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Shen Yi!

86
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Shen Yi!

87
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Shen Yi!

88
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Why is the fog on my shoulder?

89
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,160
This is the curse of the white fog.

90
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Curse?

91
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Brother Wen's life was in danger.

92
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
But the life is dead.

93
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
I'll protect you.

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Fan Xiang, this is not a game.

95
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
From now on, you must be by my side.

96
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Until I find a way to save you.

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Understand?

98
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I'll listen to you.

99
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
What's wrong?

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
The white fog is very heavy on my shoulder.

101
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
I can't stand it.

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
The white fog is temporary.

103
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
It's not heavy.

104
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
It's very heavy.

105
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Okay. Very heavy.

106
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Drink some soup.

107
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I was too busy.

109
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
And you were in trouble.

110
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
The reason why things are growing up now

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
is because you got the curse of the white fog.

112
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,160
It's not because you got the curse of the white fog.

113
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Fan Xiang, you must remember that

114
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,160
no matter when you want to save people,

115
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
it's not wrong.

116
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Maybe the process will be a little difficult.

117
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,160
But the end result is all good.

118
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Until now,

119
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,160
do I still have a way to solve it?

120
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,160
This world is connected to everything.

121
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
The curse is the same.

122
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,160
But as long as you break the relationship between the white fog and the white fog,

123
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
maybe it will be solved.

124
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
The relationship between the white fog and the white fog?

125
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
The white fog is given to you by the Chieftain.

126
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,160
If you don't know Chieftain,

127
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,160
or Chieftain didn't say that the white fog is the half-dead demon,

128
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
then it won't happen.

129
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,160
There's another way to kill the white fog.

130
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,160
But didn't you say that the white fog can't die from the dead body?

131
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
It's like this.

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,160
But as long as you use the weapon that can kill the British,

133
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
you can kill it.

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
The weapon that can kill the British.

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Is there really such a thing?

136
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
But can it be successful?

137
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
And depends on the luck?

138
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Don't think so much.

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
It's late now.

140
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Go to sleep.

141
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I won't go anywhere after the ceremony.

142
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I'll stay here with you.

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I'll stay here with you for a year.

144
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,160
You said that you were angry with me, didn't you?

145
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Then I became angry.

146
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
No matter when you say that,

147
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
you're not angry with me.

148
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Then I became angry.

149
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I don't care why you say that.

150
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I don't care.

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I don't care.

152
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
I don't care.

153
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I don't care.

154
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Why did you say that?

155
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I forgive you.

156
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
I forgive you.

158
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
I forgive you.

159
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
I forgive you.

160
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I forgive you.

161
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I forgive you.

162
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I forgive you.

163
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I forgive you.

164
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
I forgive you.

165
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I forgive you.

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I forgive you.

167
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I forgive you.

168
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I forgive you.

169
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I forgive you.

170
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I forgive you.

171
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I forgive you.

172
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
I forgive you.

173
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I forgive you.

174
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Brother Qiang.

175
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Isn't it good to be a Iron Man?

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
You and Li Tiejiang have learned this skill.

177
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
We won't be ugly in the future.

178
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
You say try it.

179
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Miss.

180
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I heard about Dr. Jiou.

181
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
What?

182
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Someone is talking to him.

183
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Dr. Jiou.

184
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
You don't know me, but I know you.

185
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
I heard from Wang Shao.

186
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
You didn't marry him.

187
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
You don't know me.

188
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
You don't know me.

189
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
You don't know me.

190
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
You don't know me.

191
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I heard from Wang Shao.

192
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
You didn't marry him.

193
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
You are 24 years old.

194
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
I have a girl.

195
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
She is 21 years old.

196
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
She is gentle and beautiful.

197
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
She is weak.

198
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
But you are a doctor.

199
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Do you want to consider this?

200
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
You don't know me.

201
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
My husband is Cui.

202
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
He is a Iron Man.

203
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
My sister is very smart.

204
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
She is very smart.

205
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
She is very good for you.

206
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
You have seen my grandma before.

207
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
We know you well.

208
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
The rumors about your family.

209
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
You are killed by people.

210
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
We don't believe it.

211
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
You are a good girl.

212
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
You are not married.

213
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
If you want to.

214
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
I can bring you here.

215
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
If you are against me.

216
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I can find someone to take care of you.

217
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
You can have a wife.

218
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
You can have a wife.

219
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
He is going to marry me.

220
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
But not your sister.

221
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Who are you?

222
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I am a patient of Dr. Jiu.

223
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I am a newbie of Dr. Jiu.

224
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Newbie?

225
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
You are young and young.

226
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
You are a newbie.

227
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
You are dreaming.

228
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
You are not awake yet.

229
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
You are not awake.

230
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
I am dreaming.

231
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Dr. Jiu.

232
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Are you kidding me?

233
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Dad.

234
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Is it true?

235
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Dr. Jiu said you are not awake.

236
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Isn't it happy?

237
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
It's my fault.

238
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I didn't make it clear.

239
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Miss. I will give you a medicine.

240
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Here. Your medicine.

241
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
By the way.

242
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Go back and take care of this house.

243
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
OK.

244
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
I am not like this.

245
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
No wonder.

246
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Why are you so angry?

247
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
No wonder you don't want to be with me.

248
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
So you want to marry a woman of the Iron Family.

249
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
You are a treasure.

250
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
How can you...

251
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Shunyi.

252
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
You are in love?

253
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
I didn't make it.

254
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Shunyi.

255
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
You used the long-haired sword.

256
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I don't know if you know it.

257
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I don't know if you know it.

258
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
I don't know.

259
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
I don't know.

260
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
So the long-haired sword is the fourth sword?

261
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
There are five swords in the Dragon-Castle.

262
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
You only saw the Tornado,

263
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
the Horses,

264
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
and the Fire.

265
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Actually there are two swords.

266
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
They are long-haired and long-haired.

267
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
But the way they are drawn is very special.

268
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
So I didn't take the sword out.

269
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
You only saw it.

270
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
When I first saw the Dragon-Castle,

271
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
there was a hole in the outside.

272
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,160
This is the mark left by the long-haired sword.

273
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
So it's very possible

274
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
that I cut off a part

275
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
about your cause.

276
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Why did you cut off a part

277
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
about my cause?

278
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
It's very possible that you are in danger.

279
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
And this is very complicated and very serious.

280
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
I can't solve it.

281
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
I used the long-haired sword.

282
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
But you said

283
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
you didn't take out the long-haired sword.

284
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
My father said

285
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
that the Eighth Gate Sect only has ten tribes

286
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
and they took out the long-haired sword.

287
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
He said this is related to the world.

288
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
But I don't know

289
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
what the world is.

290
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
You are so good.

291
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Wait.

292
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
You used other swords before

293
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
and now you have the anti-aircraft sword.

294
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
What is the anti-aircraft sword?

295
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Get up.

296
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Let me see.

297
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
The British were the biggest anti-aircraft swords.

298
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
They were moving around.

299
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Sometimes, they would change

300
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
and they would kill a person's life.

301
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Maybe

302
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
we have lost something important.

303
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
But we don't know.

304
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Long-haired sword.

305
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Long-haired sword.

306
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
It's not heavy.

307
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
It can't be used in long-haired sword.

308
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
It's like a long-haired sword.

309
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Are you two together?

310
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
If you are together,

311
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
you can eat.

312
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
I have eaten a long-haired sword.

313
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
I am hungry.

314
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Who is good to her?

315
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Go and eat.

316
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Mr. Bai,

317
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Mr. Liu,

318
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I want to see you.

319
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
This is my order.

320
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I will go.

321
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Go.

322
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Mr. Liu,

323
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Mr. Liu,

324
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Mr. Liu,

325
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Mr. Liu,

326
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Mr. Liu,

327
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Mr. Liu,

328
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Mr. Liu,

329
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Mr. Liu,

330
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Mr. Liu,

331
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Mr. Liu,

332
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Mr. Liu,

333
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Mr. Liu,

334
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Mr. Liu,

335
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Mr. Liu,

336
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Mr. Liu,

337
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,840
Mr. Liu,

338
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Mr. Liu brother.

339
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Thank you, sir.

340
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
In my opinion,

341
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
the message A is

342
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,840
iftally capable and

343
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
cheaply helpful for a busy person.

344
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Actually, I don't know how to play the piano.

345
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,840
But my master said that your piano is good.

346
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
You must be good.

347
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Your master?

348
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Li Busi Lang, Qin Xuan Zhi.

349
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Mr. Bai, don't be nervous.

350
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I came here to ask for your help.

351
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,840
In half a month, it will be the royal family's father's banquet.

352
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,840
All the important students will come to participate.

353
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,840
The master will make the wine and reward the flowers.

354
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Actually, His Majesty will personally perform the banquet.

355
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,840
He will choose the food for the winter.

356
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,840
But it will take a long time to make a good poem.

357
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
How can it be so hard to make a good song?

358
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,840
So His Majesty ordered my master to find the famous singer.

359
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,840
He will play the song on the banquet.

360
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,840
So, you choose me?

361
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,840
After the banquet, you will be the master of the birthday banquet.

362
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,840
That is the first-class piano master in the world.

363
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,840
He will make the world a cup of wine.

364
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,840
No one will know your name.

365
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Aunt.

366
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Xuanyi.

367
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Is Uncle Duan at home?

368
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Uncle, I regret it.

369
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,840
I still have to be with me in the middle of the night.

370
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
You promised me.

371
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Yes, I know.

372
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Uncle doesn't want to risk the rest of the night.

373
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,840
But I can't stay away from him because of this.

374
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Why?

375
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
I promised to leave him.

376
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I thought if I was gone,

377
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,840
he would be safe and sound.

378
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
But it seems that it's not the case.

379
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,840
You know the situation in the banquet.

380
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,840
You know that in the days when you two disappeared,

381
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,840
the emperor set the trap several times.

382
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,840
He has become more easily infected with the demon.

383
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
So I thought about it.

384
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I still think that the banquet is more stable with me.

385
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
The banquet is a keystone.

386
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
It is often taught by the demon.

387
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
But because of this,

388
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
I have the ability to protect the banquet.

389
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
You are my benefactor.

390
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
You are my father.

391
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Of course I am.

392
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I am willing to live my life.

393
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
As long as I live,

394
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
I will not be hurt by the banquet.

395
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,840
I will try my best to protect him.

396
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I hope uncle will agree to be with me.

397
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
You are my benefactor.

398
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,840
I will protect him.

399
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I will protect him.

400
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
If you are willing to be with me,

401
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,840
I am willing to live my life.

402
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Please be with me.

403
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,840
I will protect you.

404
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
I will protect you.

405
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840
I will protect you.

406
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
I will protect you.

407
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,840
It's the great beauty.

408
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,320
He said that Mr. Bai, the Qin Shi Lang, has been looking after you for a long time.

409
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,040
He wants you to go to the market and make a promise.

410
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,080
Sir, don't you like it?

411
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,280
Every day, I meet a person who is kind and kind.

412
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,400
It's a good thing.

413
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
The place in Shendu is not suitable for me.

414
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,880
But you've never been to Shendu.

415
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
I've never been there, but I've heard that

416
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,520
Shendu is indeed a great person.

417
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,760
People who know the way of life are a few times better than Guangping City.

418
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,200
But there are people who really have a heart to listen to.

419
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
What's the least to know? Because there, no matter how the situation is,

420
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,400
it's just a tool for the whole Guilin to use the wind and wind.

421
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,480
But...

422
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,760
You really want to go?

423
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,080
How could it be?

424
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,720
They invited Mr. Bai to come to me.

425
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,600
Moreover, I'm not qualified to go to that kind of banquet.

426
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,840
I just want you to feel at ease.

427
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,440
If you give up this opportunity to go to the world,

428
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,120
that would be too much.

429
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
If you really like the Qin, you should understand that

430
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,360
life is peaceful and you are talking about it.

431
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,160
The fate is more important than the fame and the life.

432
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,920
Tomorrow, I'll go to the waterfront.

433
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,200
Have a good rest.

434
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,280
Yes.

435
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,400
A lousy event?

436
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,040
Mr. Zhu?

437
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,000
What do you want to lose from me?

438
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Would you like to tell me where I got your tan?

439
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,280
No need for your permission. Thank you.

440
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I've thought about it.

441
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I think you're right.

442
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
I've been too impulsive.

443
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
I should take a rest now.

444
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Be careful on your way.

445
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
I won't be sent.

446
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Okay.

447
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
I haven't eaten for two days.

448
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
I haven't seen a single one.

449
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I can only go to the pear tree.

450
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Why can't you eat?

451
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
No matter how much you eat, you can't not eat.

452
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
It's bad to change your body.

453
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Actually, I always think that you're doing well now.

454
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
If you lose weight,

455
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
you'll be so cute.

456
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Fan Xia, that hospital is very famous.

457
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Let's go and see.

458
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Fan Xia, let's go to the pool.

459
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
You go first.

460
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I think I've met an old friend.

461
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Then come to me quickly.

462
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I've met a former teacher.

463
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
We met again.

464
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Are you begging for a hangover?

465
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Why are you still here?

466
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm not here.

467
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Why are you still here?

468
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
After I came out of the painting, I went back to the Pu Tishan.

469
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
The mountain is still the mountain.

470
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I'm used to it.

471
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I didn't see the teacher.

472
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
It's said that the red red hair 60 years ago

473
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
will be all over the place.

474
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Then how can you be so good?

475
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
The light in the painting can't be fixed.

476
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
After coming out, my family and friends are not here anymore.

477
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
The sea is cold and the sky is clear.

478
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
The world is full of thousands of worlds.

479
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
There are many rules in the world.

480
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm just a good example.

481
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Teacher, please sit.

482
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Teacher, you don't have to be so sad.

483
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
We have a reason.

484
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Let me stick it on you.

485
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
The heart has a wish to read three times.

486
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
If you five and five modern characters

487
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
and your mom they will all die,

488
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
and their knowledge will be assemble.

489
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Together we will make this dream come true thus far,

490
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
todas gracias.

491
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Let me look at me.

492
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm acarbon-soaked firm Umber Won.

493
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
In Minister Jin's name,

494
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
I vent my anger on you with the scary sword petty.

495
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
For me, it is very difficult to reach the left arm.

496
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Don't鬼-earing in her name?

497
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Laoer, if you have any difficulties,

498
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,780
come to Si Fang Street to find me at the house next to the Shantang Hall.

499
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,280
I'll just stay there.

500
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
You don't have to worry about me.

501
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,280
You can be poor or poor.

502
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Although the world is not as beautiful as it is in the painting world,

503
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
I'm really alive.

504
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
I'm alive to be full of joy.

505
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm alive to be full of joy.

506
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Chief, please help me to get the money.

507
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Thank you for your help.

508
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
I'm willing to go to Shandong with you.

509
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm only afraid that my poor love

510
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
will be able to enter the Shandong's door.

511
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Mr. Bai is too modest.

512
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
You'll be famous in the future.

513
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
I'll lend you a hand.

514
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Mr. Bai Fang, don't forget to dig a well.

515
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Of course.

516
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
If Bai Ning really has this day,

517
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
I'll be the one to repay your kindness.

518
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Since you've made a promise,

519
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,280
I'll return to the Shantang after three days.

520
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Then I'll come to your house in the city gate.

521
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Three days?

522
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
What?

523
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Mr. Bai, do you need a house?

524
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
If so,

525
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
I'll be able to stay here for a few days

526
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
and save some money.

527
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
No need.

528
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Just three days.

529
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
How did you get here?

530
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
You're done?

532
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
You're so big.

533
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,280
You're even holding Xiao Yan?

534
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
I'm really sorry.

535
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Say it.

536
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
How did you get here?

537
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
You were the one who walked here.

538
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Why are you blaming others now?

539
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
You're so mean.

540
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Thank you for helping me out today.

541
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
It's okay.

542
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
You're the ones who helped me out.

543
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
No.

544
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
I didn't expect to see you here today.

545
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,280
The fate of life is still very strange.

546
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Yes.

547
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
It's really extraordinary.

548
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
So,

549
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
when you're in trouble,

550
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
you have to ask for help to solve the mystery.

551
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,280
You just heard the words you want to hear today.

552
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
People should pray for the good of life.

553
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,280
You should know what you want in life.

554
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
That's right.

555
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,280
But we have to learn to be content.

556
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,280
My old friend told me today

557
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
that if you have the sincerity and sincerity,

558
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
you can't solve the problem.

559
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
You're right.

560
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,280
The worst thing is that you don't have the sincerity.

561
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Life is short.

562
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,280
It doesn't make this life a happy one.

563
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Okay.

564
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm going back now.

565
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I'll take my leave.

566
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Goodbye, Yuanyuan.

567
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Let's go to the water room to listen to the song.

568
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,280
I'll wait for you at the water room.

569
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
I go for now.

570
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,960
A little something.

571
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Do you see where thelin aced?

572
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,520
No way!

573
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm wearing a dress.

574
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Bodhisattva.

575
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
It's Bodhisattva's gift.

576
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
You're pregnant,

577
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
and you're in a serious condition.

578
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
You can't take it.

579
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Actually,

580
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
as long as you're willing to do it,

581
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
even if you don't come here personally,

582
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
you can hear the divine voice.

583
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
You're a good person.

584
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
You'll be safe and sound.

585
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Thank you, sir.

586
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
I've heard that

587
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,280
the Buddha of the Fire Tribe has a request for a seal.

588
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,280
So you're here to return the divine power to the temple?

589
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
I'm a disciple of Bodhisattva.

590
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
I was forced by Bodhisattva.

591
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Fang Youyuan got the spirit to open the temple.

592
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
After the ritual,

593
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
I naturally stayed here to offer the divine power

594
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
to the temple to return the divine power.

595
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
The demon of the Qu Qu

596
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
also deserves to be punished by the Buddha.

597
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,280
The mortal is kind and can be kind.

598
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
I'm not talented.

599
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
But I'm capable of

600
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
saving people

601
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
from the mortal.

602
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Why not?

603
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Yes.

604
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
If you really want to help the people

605
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
and be kind to them,

606
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
the demon can naturally

607
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
wake up in the morning.

608
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
But if you're the one

609
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
who's full of blood,

610
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Zhang Pu and Lv Sanlang

611
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
are dead in your hands, right?

612
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
The seal of the seal

613
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
is a human being.

614
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
The people of the world

615
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
are not the same.

616
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
The immortal is one of them.

617
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
I heard that the immortal's body is hard

618
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
and helpless.

619
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
He can only say his own wrongs

620
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
to the Buddha.

621
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
And you

622
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,280
are here to hear his request, right?

623
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
I'm just repaying the divine power to the Buddha.

624
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
You're here to repay the divine power?

625
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
There are so many people

626
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
who are here to repent.

627
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
But those who are dying

628
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
are those who are willing to repent.

629
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
They will never repent.

630
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I just want to know

631
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
why you're the only one

632
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
who's trying to be kind to the immortal.

633
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I don't care what you're

634
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
and he are.

635
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
It's wrong to

636
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
hurt people's lives.

637
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
You're the one who's trying to be kind to the world.

638
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
The evil world is the only one

639
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
that's not the same.

640
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
It's better to say it in the world.

641
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
You're always saying that the evil world is the only one.

642
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
Then you're the one who's trying to be kind to the world.

643
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
It's the evil world.

644
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
You're the one who's trying to be kind to the world.

645
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
It's the evil world.

646
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Since it's the evil world,

647
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
why did I make a mistake?

648
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
It's not wrong to be kind to the evil world.

649
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
The real mistake is

650
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
the way you're doing evil.

651
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,280
There are rules and regulations in the world.

652
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
You used the magic to punish the evil

653
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,280
and committed the murder.

654
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
I'm a demon.

655
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I only know one thing.

656
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Once you kill someone,

657
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
you can't forgive them.

658
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Once you make a promise,

659
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
you can't accept it.

660
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
You'll have the second time

661
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,280
and even thousands of times.

662
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Today, you're the one who's trying to kill people.

663
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
What about tomorrow?

664
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
What if there are other reasons?

665
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
What will you do?

666
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
What kind of place will you be?

667
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
I know that

668
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
the snake has a strong tongue and a strong bone.

669
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
It's a good example of a change of the evil.

670
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,280
You've been hiding the body in your house.

671
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
You're the one who's trying to be kind to the evil world.

672
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,280
She's not making a mistake. Don't you dare touch her.

673
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
I won't touch her

674
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
because you're kind to the evil world.

675
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
I won't touch you either.

676
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
But I have a condition.

677
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
I want you to leave Guangping

678
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
and never come back.

679
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
I swear

680
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I won't hurt anyone's life again.

681
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
In a few days,

682
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I'll leave Guangping.

683
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Today, I've got some vinegar.

684
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
I'll have a cup of tea

685
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
and a toast to Mr. Jiang.

686
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Thank you for saving my life.

687
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
You gave me a new life.

688
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
If it wasn't for you,

689
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
I'm afraid I'd be locked up in the house

690
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
and beat up every day.

691
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
And I won't have a good life.

692
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
I can't even see

693
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
such a vast world.

694
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Mr. Jiang, thank you.

695
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Do you want to go to the capital?

696
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
The capital is a capital city.

697
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Although it's prosperous,

698
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
it's also a mystery.

699
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
It's a city with a lot of resources.

700
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
It's not cheap.

701
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
I heard

702
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,280
even the paper is more expensive than the other ones.

703
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I thought about it before.

704
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
It's because Mr. Gu said

705
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
he would lend you to His Majesty.

706
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
I think this is a good opportunity

707
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
to be a man of great talent.

708
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
But now that I think about it,

709
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
I don't need it anymore.

710
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Mr. Jiang,

711
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,280
you're kind and tall.

712
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,280
You're like a fairy.

713
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
You shouldn't have

714
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
the fame and power

715
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
in this world.

716
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm afraid I'll be too old for that.

717
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,280
I also want to go to Jiangnan.

718
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
You and I

719
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
can be together.

720
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Don't you want to leave Guangping?

721
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
This is not the time to compete.

722
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Now I'm in the same boat

723
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
as Guangping.

724
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
It's time to leave.

725
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
But...

726
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
I know you're worried,

727
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
but I won't leave Guangping

728
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
because of your care.

729
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm worried about you.

730
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Worry about you?

731
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Worry about you?

732
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
I've thought about it.

733
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Instead of being in this

734
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
place and watching the sky,

735
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
why don't we

736
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
invite the world to see it?

737
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I just found out

738
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
there are a few Qinji masters in Jiangnan.

739
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Maybe you and I

740
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
can go visit them.

741
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
If you're bored in Jiangnan,

742
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
we can go to Qingzhou

743
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
to see them fly in March.

744
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,280

745
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,280
to see the desert.

746
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280

747
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
we can leave here

748
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
to live a completely different life.

749
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
It's also good

750
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,280

751
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
