1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What if I can't find the key?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hey lady, we are going to the hospital.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,440
I can't leave at this hour anyway.

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
Do you want to go out and get some fresh air?

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,880
Are you crazy?

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,800
Which company are you from?

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,600
What's your name?

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,320
I'm Xuanyi.

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Where is this?

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,600
What are you doing?

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,360
Who are you?

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,080
Don't talk.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,840
Let me in.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Brother.

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,520
Brother.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,760
I'm hungry.

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,080
Can you

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,400
give me some food?

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm still hungry.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,160
Don't be so silent.

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,360
Go ahead and tell me,

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,600
are you robbing the money or stealing them?

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
Well, we can see the money.

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,240
My family is rich.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
We need to talk about it.

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
Think about it.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,880
It's not totally obvious

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,840
what would happen

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,400
even when an ugly woman

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,800
falls in your hands.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,040
I wouldn't be able to escape.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,480
this is not totally obvious

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,680
What do you want to do?

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,760
Can't you

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,200
never drink up my stomach?

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
You'll be out of water in the pool.

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,320
You won't get anything.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,920
Don't touch me.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,360
I mean it.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,720
I've been so busy since this morning.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,960
You know how hard it is for a girl to be successful.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Listen.

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,640
I have to wash my face in the morning.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,160
After that, I have to change my clothes.

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,680
After that...

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Let me go!

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,960
Come on.

65
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,840
Come on.

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
Brother, where are you going?

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm done. He's angry.

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,440
What are you doing?

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I told you not to mess around.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Do you know who I am?

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,160
Where is he?

72
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,600
You mean our brother?

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
Yes.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
Aren't you hungry?

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,520
Da Mao should go to buy you food.

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,400
His name is Da Mao?

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,520
Yes.

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
He didn't tell you his name?

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,480
You don't even know his name?

80
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,880
How would I know?

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
Because he likes you.

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
A few days ago, he went to the south first.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,000
Then he went to the north.

84
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,080
Then he met you.

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,080
Then he fell in love with you.

86
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
He likes me?

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Yes.

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
Don't you know?

89
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't know.

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,440
Oh, no.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Oh, no.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
He's so pitiful.

93
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,320
He's so useless.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
So he's Dan...

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Shut up!

96
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Stop talking.

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,120
What's there to say?

98
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Our brother met you when he went out.

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
Then he fell in love with you.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
He didn't want you to marry someone else.

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,680
So we came to steal the money.

102
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
So you're our sister-in-law now.

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,320
Sister-in-law.

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,040
In short...

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,560
Absolutely.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,880
Stop laughing.

107
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
Come on.

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,680
I bought some for you.

109
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,880
Eat it.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,280
No, I'm not hungry.

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Be polite.

112
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,520
Line up.

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
I'll give it to her.

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,000
Go.

115
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll give it to her.

116
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
You go first.

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,320
How can I eat it if you don't open my hand?

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,760
You don't eat?

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm not hungry.

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
You have four brothers in your family.

121
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
Are your parents still in Guangping?

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,040
You don't have to ask me anything.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,720
You don't have to test me, either.

124
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,320
I won't hurt you.

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
I just haven't figured out

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
what way to tell you all this.

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll think about it.

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,280
I'll tell you when I think it over.

129
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,880
You're much more handsome

130
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,960
than your three brothers.

131
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,040
You don't have to do this.

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Your brothers told me

133
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
that you went to a wedding

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
because you liked me.

135
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,400
When did we meet?

136
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,080
Did you meet me in Guangping?

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,320
Why didn't I pick you up?

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,640
That's right.

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,440
I've been attracted to someone since I was a kid.

140
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
But you came too late.

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
You know my husband.

142
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,600
He's from the government.

143
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,200
He's a criminal

144
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
if he steals money from you.

145
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,680
How about this?

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
Let me go now.

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll talk to him when I get back.

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,480
I'll let him treat you better.

149
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
You're still young.

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
I don't understand.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
You can't force yourself to love someone.

152
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,480
Just take it as

153
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,680
we're meant to be.

154
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
Okay?

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,840
I...

156
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I'll go now.

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,920
Did you hear that?

158
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,120
His Majesty is getting married today.

159
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,000
But his bride was taken away by his husband.

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,200
There are officials and servants looking for her.

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
I didn't know it was a man.

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,320
She's running away with her husband.

163
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,400
We can talk about this in the future.

164
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,440
That's right.

165
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,480
The imperial guards are coming.

166
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
Who's that?

167
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Who's that?

168
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
My lord.

169
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,400
Don't make a noise.

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Greetings, my lord.

171
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
The brothers of the Wei Ming Gang have left the capital.

172
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,080
I believe we can catch them soon.

173
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
The criminal said

174
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
he's going to save my wife.

175
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
After that,

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,640
I hope you can be kind to

177
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,840
the brothers in the prison.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
I'll tell them the truth.

179
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
The killer must be executed.

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
We can discuss the rest.

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
It's a deal.

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
If I get word,

183
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,560
I'll have a special plan

184
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,640
to save my wife.

185
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,520
Yes, my lord.

186
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,960
Go, go, go.

187
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,520
Hurry up.

188
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,080
That way.

189
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,920
Okay.

190
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,800
You go that way.

191
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,560
Yes.

192
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,600
You go that way.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,320
My hand hurts.

194
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,640
What's wrong with your hand?

195
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,920
You've tied me up for so long.

196
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,440
My hand feels numb now.

197
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't move it.

198
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,320
How about this?

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,560
Can you help me

200
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,760
to untie me?

201
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,960
Do you think I can trust you?

202
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
Okay, okay.

203
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
Can you change your posture?

204
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
You can tie me up in front.

205
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,540
Wow.

206
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
Bro, I'm their dancing lady.

207
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,280
Why are you...

208
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,240
Me?

209
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,800
I told you.

210
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,480
You do that yourself.

211
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Don't you mean to say

212
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,520
that you like me

213
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,480
that you don't know even when I know some martial arts?

214
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,600
You say that,

215
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
don't install any tall American帽e there again.

216
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,520
Cut my arm into a stick.

217
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,040
Wou,

218
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
get up there.

219
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,720
I'll kill you with a court sword.

220
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,960
I...

221
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,320
You have a problem?

222
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,080
Big brother, I...

223
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,960
You have a problem too?

224
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
Are you okay?

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,280
Why did you bleed when you were shot?

226
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
Stay there!

227
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Help me!

228
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
Hit him!

229
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
Help me!

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,560
What are you doing?

231
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Third! Fourth!

232
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,320
Big brother.

233
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,920
It's him, Miss He.

234
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
It's him.

235
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,120
Miss, don't be nervous.

236
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
It's the Imperial Guard who sent us to pick you up.

237
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,920
I've already sent a message.

238
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Soon, Lord Huang will personally pick you up.

239
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,920
Don't wait for him. I'll go back now.

240
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,320
No!

241
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,520
Unless he passes this test,

242
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,720
otherwise, he can't leave.

243
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520
You're so smart.

244
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
No need to ask.

245
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
You're the one who stole the wedding.

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
You're so bold.

247
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,720
How dare you steal a woman from our Imperial Guard?

248
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,520
Are you scolding my big brother?

249
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,520
I'll fight you!

250
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,120
Big brother!

251
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
Stop fighting!

252
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
I'll go with you!

253
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
You brat.

254
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
You're pretty tough.

255
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,720
Today, unless you kill me,

256
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,520
otherwise, don't even think of taking him away.

257
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Are you stupid?

258
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,720
They hit me.

259
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Are you stupid? What if they kill you?

260
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,520
Sure.

261
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,120
You really have guts.

262
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,320
I'll break your wish!

263
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,520
Stop fighting!

264
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
What are you looking at?

265
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,620
Hurry and leave!

266
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,920
Quickly!

267
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
My Lord.

268
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Oh no, Miss He and her husband ran to the west.

269
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
What?

270
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,220
Sir, I just heard about it.

271
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,720
The people saw Miss He and her husband run to the west.

272
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,220
You can't lift your arms or your shoulders.

273
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
You're not fit to carry three stupid brothers.

274
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,720
Why are you so angry?

275
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I know I'm more attractive.

276
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,220
But your husband is a good man.

277
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Why did he have to hang himself on my tree?

278
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,720
If I hadn't saved you, you would have been dead.

279
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
Do you see the blood on your handkerchief?

280
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,720
Yes.

281
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,720
What color?

282
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Red.

283
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,220
What color did the people who fought with us just now have?

284
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Are you trying to trick me?

285
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,720
What color?

286
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,220
It must be red.

287
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,220
You can't tell the difference?

288
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Then why did you help me?

289
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,220
How do I know why I helped you?

290
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,220
Maybe I'm as stupid as you.

291
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
When those people go back,

292
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,220
my father will break my legs.

293
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,720
You're still laughing?

294
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Don't be afraid.

295
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Everything will be fine when you wake up tomorrow.

296
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,220
I don't understand what you're talking about.

297
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm engaged anyway.

298
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,220
I won't like you no matter how much you like me.

299
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,720
I'm going home.

300
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,220
Wolf?

301
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,720
Wolf.

302
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,720
It's true that rumors are not true.

303
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,720
You really have a relationship with someone else.

304
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,720
How can you do this to me?

305
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,720
I'm going to kill him now.

306
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
Why are you following him?

307
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,720
No, listen to me.

308
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
I don't want to listen to your explanation.

309
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,220
He Xuelian.

310
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
You and I are childhood friends.

311
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
We're childhood friends.

312
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,220
My heart has long belonged to you.

313
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
But you treat me like this.

314
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,720
You...

315
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
You bad woman!

316
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm going to kill you now!

317
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
You fell down yourself.

318
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,220
Go, go, go.

319
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,720
Did I break the mirror?

320
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,720
Don't stay here! Go after him!

321
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,220
Yes, sir.

322
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Stop!

323
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,220
I'm here.

324
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,220
Go after him!

325
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Go, go, go.

326
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,720
It's safe now.

327
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Go.

328
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,220
Oh, no.

329
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,720
Even if you jump into the Yellow River, you can't wash it.

330
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,220
Then don't wash it.

331
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Go.

332
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,720
Why should I go?

333
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
You...

334
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Do you know how to treat a woman?

335
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,220
My family is losing face because of me.

336
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,220
You can't win over everything even if you love men and women.

337
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Besides, I don't love you.

338
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,720
How long have I known you?

339
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,220
I'm touched that you got a brick for me.

340
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
But today is my wedding day.

341
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,720
If you really like me, you can't hurt me like this.

342
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,220
Are you angry?

343
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Isn't it obvious?

344
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,220
You like You Huang?

345
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,720
Who is You Huang?

346
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
The man who just got hurt.

347
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
That's my husband.

348
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
So you like him?

349
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,220
Yes.

350
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,220
I don't want to explain it to you.

351
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,720
If I want to go back with you and explain it,

352
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,220
will you feel better?

353
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,220
But I have a request.

354
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Accompany me for this day.

355
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,220
What request?

356
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,220
It's simple. Just follow me.

357
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
I'll send you back when the time comes.

358
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,720
I'll explain it to you in a simple way.

359
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
I'll let you go.

360
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
You...

361
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Accompany you for one day?

362
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Then what should I do with you?

363
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,720
Don't worry.

364
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I won't force you to do anything that's against your heart.

365
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Just walk around with me.

366
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
You're serious?

367
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Yes.

368
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,220
You should know that

369
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,220
you'll be punished if you go back with me.

370
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,220
And this man is from the government.

371
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,720
You've made him lose so much face.

372
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,220
Once he enters that door,

373
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
you won't be the one to decide.

374
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
I know.

375
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
You're a gentleman.

376
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
I know.

377
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
A gentleman's words are hard to follow.

378
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Why are you so stubborn?

379
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I told you.

380
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I just want you to accompany me for one day.

381
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
You've done so much

382
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
just to let me accompany you for one day?

383
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
You can understand that.

384
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,720
You're really a man of your word.

385
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Accompany you!

386
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I'll accompany you. I promise.

387
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Let's go.

388
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Then...

389
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
follow me.

390
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Okay.

391
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Take care.

392
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Let's go.

393
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Please enjoy.

394
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
This way, please.

395
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Please.

396
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
What would you like to eat?

397
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Anything is fine.

398
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
What's the matter?

399
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Tell us.

400
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
You didn't hear?

401
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,220
Something big happened today.

402
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
What's that?

403
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,720
The new father of the county magistrate

404
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,220
was taken away by the priest.

405
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
And this?

406
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
Tell me.

407
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,720
Didn't you see?

408
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
The priest ran away with his wife.

409
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
That sounds more interesting than the story.

410
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
That's interesting.

411
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
The story?

412
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Look at this.

413
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,720
The story of the six seasons

414
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
is full of beautiful flowers.

415
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,220
The wind blows in the year.

416
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,720
That's so bad.

417
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
The day of the wedding

418
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,220
is the day of the wedding.

419
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
It's a chess game.

420
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Maybe in the future,

421
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
it will be named after the Gouping.

422
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
Hey!

423
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Who are you talking about?

424
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,720
What's going on?

425
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,220
What's wrong with you?

426
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Calm down.

428
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
What's going on?

429
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
Calm down.

430
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Thank you.

432
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
It's not your fault.

433
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
It's my fault.

434
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Where do you want to eat?

435
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Do you know the six seasons of Gouping?

436
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Yes.

437
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
What are they?

438
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,720
The ten southern plains, the spring color of the pond,

439
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720
the sky, the lake, the fire, the flower, the temple,

440
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
the lake, the night,

441
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
and the yin and yang tree.

442
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,220
How do you know?

443
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Everyone knows.

444
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Everyone in Gouping knows.

445
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
What's the night banquet in Nanhu?

446
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
It's a banquet for the children

447
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
invited by King of Xinwan.

448
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
When?

449
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Tonight.

450
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,220
How do you know about tonight?

451
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,220
Or you knew it since you were a child?

452
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
I don't know.

453
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
I don't know.

454
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Time is precious.

455
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Eat.

456
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
I still don't understand

457
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,220
why I know there's a Nanhu banquet today.

458
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,220
Let me ask you.

459
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
What day is it today?

460
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Today is the day of the Yellow Road.

461
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Yes.

462
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Today is your wedding day.

463
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Of course it's the day of the Yellow Road.

464
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
But you don't remember

465
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
the specific date today.

466
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Don't think about it.

467
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
You can't remember it.

468
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Because there's no specific date

469
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
in this place.

470
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Although Gouping and Liujue have a good reputation,

471
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
they're not in the same age.

472
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Nanhu Night Banquet is two years old.

473
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Shen Yingniang of Tianxiang Lake and Wu

474
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
is an ancient person from hundreds of years ago.

475
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,220
And the Shi Nan Tower

476
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
has been destroyed by a fire.

477
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
I don't understand what you're talking about.

478
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,220
Anyway,

479
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,220
my Gouping is different from yours.

480
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
Okay, let's go and have a look.

481
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
Maybe there's an answer.

482
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Didn't you say there's a fire here?

483
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Where's the fire?

484
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
What are you doing here?

485
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
The air is nice.

486
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
The view is nice too.

487
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,220
You should try it.

488
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Men usually

489
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,220
try to

490
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
show their talent at this time.

491
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
It's... it's... it's...

492
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Where are you going?

493
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Are you okay?

494
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
It's okay. It's okay.

495
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
What happened to you just now?

496
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
What do you mean?

497
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Don't think I didn't see it.

498
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Did you do it on purpose?

499
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
I didn't do it on purpose.

500
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
You're lying to me again, aren't you?

501
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
What are you doing here now?

502
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
To be fair,

503
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
we've already been to Shi Nan Yuan Temple.

504
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
This is the second place in the spring color of Tang Yuan.

505
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
They say the second son of the Tang family

506
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
is a flowery and beautiful woman.

507
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,640
It's called the

508
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Yau Ai peony.

509
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
There are many kinds of peonies in here.

510
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
The color is also very good.

511
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
It's like a cloud.

512
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Why are you going in here?

513
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
No need.

514
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Mr. Tang, it's right here.

515
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Did you say that there's a good purple dragon ring

516
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
that you want to sell to me?

517
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
No.

518
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
You said you had something to sell.

519
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Are you two

520
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
trying to trick me?

521
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
We are

522
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
tricking you.

523
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
What?

524
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Sir, are you okay?

525
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
You hit me.

526
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Help!

527
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Help! Go save them!

528
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Help!

529
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Go!

530
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
What's wrong?

531
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
You asked me what's wrong? I want to ask you what's wrong?

532
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
What are you doing?

533
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
No matter what you are doing,

534
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Miss Liao won't play with you anymore. I'm going home.

535
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I suddenly feel that the land in front of your house

536
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
is really a treasure land.

537
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
If I hit my head there,

538
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I can still see you coming out.

539
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
This is also a wish of mine.

540
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
You are threatening me.

541
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Didn't you promise me that you will be with me all day?

542
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
You can't break your promise.

543
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
But I promised to go for a walk with you.

544
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I didn't promise to bully anyone with you.

545
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Then I promise you

546
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
that I will never do anything stupid again.

547
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
I won't win again.

548
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
I have no other choice.

549
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
If I go home with you today,

550
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
I will probably be locked up in jail.

551
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Those two people have a problem with me.

552
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
If I take this chance to end this grudge,

553
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm afraid that I will die in a bad way.

554
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
What do you mean by die?

555
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
You have done this.

556
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
You will be beaten up a few times

557
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
and locked up in a few bars.

558
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Then you say you push people

559
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
and beat them. What kind of attack is that?

560
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
It's getting late. Let's go for a walk.

561
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Didn't you promise me that you will be with me all day?

562
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Who promised you?

563
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I will take you to a place.

564
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
I don't want to go with you.

565
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Sir, your dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

566
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
You used the money to sell my jewelry

567
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
and came to see the chicken.

568
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
You are really generous.

569
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I will return it to you tomorrow.

570
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
What do you want to return?

571
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Good!

572
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Hey!

573
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Hey!

574
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Hey!

575
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Hey! What hey?

576
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
My name is Xuan Yi.

577
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
I don't care what your name is.

578
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Are you a little too much?

579
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
You said you liked me.

580
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Even if the prison asked me to accompany you this day,

581
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
you came to see other women.

582
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
You can't even open your eyes. What do you think I am?

583
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
I don't know.

584
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Where did this come from?

585
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Du Fu!

586
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Who are you talking about? I'm talking to you.

587
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Brother,

588
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
why don't you take care of your brother?

589
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
That's right!

590
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Take care of him!

591
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Who is his wife? If you talk nonsense again,

592
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I'll break your teeth.

593
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Who are you talking about? I'm talking to you.

594
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
You are so stubborn.

595
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Come here!

596
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Let's continue drinking.

597
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
Why are you laughing?

598
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Nothing.

599
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Okay, don't be angry.

600
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
I'm not here to see Wu Ji.

601
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
I came here for my own reason.

602
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
What reason?

603
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
You won't believe it even if I tell you.

604
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Anyway, we only have this day to meet.

605
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
You just have to be patient.

606
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Wait until tonight.

607
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Everything will be like before.

608
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
You will also forget me completely.

609
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
You are so great.

610
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
How can I forget you?

611
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Great!

612
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
You eat first.

613
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
I'll go and make it convenient.

614
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
I didn't eat.

615
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
What's convenient?

616
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Lady Shen!

617
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Lady Shen!

618
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Lady Shen, you danced so well today.

619
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
Young Master, you can't come here.

620
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
You go out quickly.

621
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Lady Shen, I've been waiting for you.

622
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Drink with me.

623
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Let go!

624
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Drink with me.

625
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Why are you still here?

626
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Your friend has left.

627
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Why are you here again?

628
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I...

629
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,480
What's wrong with me?

630
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Lady Shen, you have to be careful.

631
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
If you are too bold,

632
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
someone will catch you.

633
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Be careful, you will be hurt.

634
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Thank you for your help.

635
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
You are fine.

636
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
You are fine, right?

637
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Banxia!

638
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Banxia!

639
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Banxia!

640
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Banxia!

641
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Who is Banxia?

642
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Okay, okay, okay.

643
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
He Qulian, Miss He.

644
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Listen to me.

645
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Are you okay?

646
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Are you hurt?

647
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Our film is good!

648
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Good!

649
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Are you still angry?

650
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Good! Good!

651
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
It's really not what you see.

652
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Even if I explain it to you,

653
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
you won't believe it.

654
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
You said you would go back with me

655
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
to explain it, but you still did it.

656
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
I did it.

657
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I won't talk to you.

658
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I won't listen to you.

659
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
I know.

660
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
You will be punished.

661
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
You will be punished.

662
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
You will be punished.

663
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Maybe you will be jailed.

664
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I know.

665
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Are you crazy?

666
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Do you know

667
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
I will get married today?

668
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Even if the groom hates me

669
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
and won't marry me,

670
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
my father will marry me to someone else.

671
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
To whom?

672
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
A lot.

673
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
It could be the son of a rich businessman,

674
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
a senior in the martial arts world,

675
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
or a scholar from a far away country.

676
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Anyway, it's not...

677
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
It won't be a man.

678
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
It won't be me.

679
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Yes.

680
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
My father will think you don't deserve me.

681
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
He won't marry you.

682
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
You can give up on it.

683
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Okay.

684
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Stop!

685
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
I regret it.

686
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
I don't need you to go back with me.

687
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
You are

688
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
a man who wants martial arts but doesn't have it.

689
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
You want to be a good wife but you don't have it.

690
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
I feel ashamed

691
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
to be married to a man like you.

692
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Leave Guangping City.

693
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Don't let me see you again.

694
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You can go wherever you want.

695
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Find a suitable man and marry him.

696
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Don't be so arrogant.

697
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Don't think too much.

698
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Don't do anything that won't result in anything.

699
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
You want to trouble others.

700
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Do you hear me?

701
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
What do you mean by something that will result in something?

702
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Love is a matter of two people.

703
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
If you like him, he will respond to you.

704
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
That's what results in.

705
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
When the sun rises tomorrow,

706
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
you won't remember me, right?

707
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
You are so annoying.

708
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Who will forget you?

709
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
You don't understand.

710
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Everything here

711
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
is like a dream.

712
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Nothing can be left behind.

713
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
If I tell you

714
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
that we have known each other for a long time,

715
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
will you believe me?

716
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
But I don't remember you.

717
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
You don't have to remember me.

718
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
I'll remember you.

719
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
I'll remember you.

720
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
I'll remember you.

721
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I want to sing a love song

722
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
to sing to you

723
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
I want to sing a love song

724
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
to see you

725
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
as a star

726
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I want to see you as a star

727
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Actually,

728
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I like you very much.

729
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
But I don't know

730
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
when did we start.

731
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Maybe,

732
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
a long time ago.

733
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
The reason I didn't respond to you

734
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
is because

735
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I think it's impossible between us.

736
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
I am a demon hunter

737
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
who is seeking for life

738
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
in the rain of wind and snow.

739
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
But you are different.

740
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You have your original peaceful life.

741
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
You have your parents who love you.

742
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
And a suitable husband.

743
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Because of the demon,

744
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
your life has some flaws.

745
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
That's why you have no fight

746
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
and have a fight with me.

747
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
And I

748
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
should help you correct these flaws

749
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
and send you back to the real life.

750
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
and send you back to the real life.

751
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
In all cases,

752
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
I shouldn't like you.

753
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
What are you talking about?

754
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
I don't understand.

755
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
It doesn't matter.

756
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Even if you understand,

757
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
you won't remember tomorrow.

758
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
What a beautiful night.

759
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
It's a pity that there is no moon.

760
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
The moon?

761
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Brother, did you hurt yourself?

762
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
What are you doing?

763
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Help me up.

764
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
It's okay.

765
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I am your brother.

766
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Brother, do you listen to me?

767
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Yes.

768
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Congratulations.

769
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Thank you.

770
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Congratulations.

771
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Congratulations.

772
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Congratulations.

773
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Brother,

774
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
I am a little nervous

775
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
because it's my first time to steal a bride.

776
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
I used to steal a bride for a bridegroom.

777
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I have never done this before.

778
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
It's my first time.

779
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
I am also very nervous.

780
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
I am also very nervous.

781
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Don't panic.

782
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Everything will go as I ordered.

783
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Okay.

784
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Congratulations.

785
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Congratulations.

786
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Congratulations.

787
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Shen Ye.

788
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Shen Ye.

789
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Don't go home so late.

790
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Ermao, Ermao.

791
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
I'll go and make it convenient.

792
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Brother.

793
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Brother.

794
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Brother.

795
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Lanxia.

796
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Lanxia.

797
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
I am here.

798
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
You remember?

799
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Come with me.

800
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
How did you recover your memory?

801
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I don't know.

802
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I remember when I woke up today.

803
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
How did you find me?

804
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I followed the clues you left

805
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
and went to the Tihu Bookstore.

806
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
The shopkeeper is really special.

807
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
I accidentally fell into the

808
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
broad spring day picture in the fight with him.

809
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
After coming in,

810
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
I saw you and Youhuang who lost their memories.

811
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Except us,

812
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
there must be a lot of

813
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
people who were trapped in the picture.

814
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Maybe your parents

815
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
were trapped in this picture.

816
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
You have clues?

817
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
In this broad spring day picture,

818
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
there are six broad-screen names

819
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
and six broad-screen characters.

820
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Yesterday, we went to three places.

821
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
The owner of the Shennanta Tower,

822
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
the owner of Tang Yuan,

823
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
and the dancer of the dance, I have tried them.

824
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
They are all the same as us.

825
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
But how do you distinguish

826
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
the person who entered the picture and the person in the picture?

827
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Look.

828
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
That's ink.

829
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
The blood of the person who entered the picture is all red.

830
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
And the blood of the other people after they were hurt,

831
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,480
including these things that are completely destroyed,

832
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
will become ink.

833
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
But this broad-screen name is so big.

834
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
The number of people is so big.

835
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
There are thousands of people.

836
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
We can't just try them one by one.

837
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
The person who entered the picture is not the one who was caught by the person.

838
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
The person who entered the picture is the one who was caught by the person

839
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
who entered the picture.

840
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
So,

841
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
as long as we enter the picture,

842
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
we can find my parents?

843
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
This dress is so inconvenient.

844
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
We have to find a place to change it.

845
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Okay.

846
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
You are here.

847
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Let her go.

848
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Calm down. Don't hurt her.

849
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
He Qunlian.

850
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
You are protecting her.

851
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Why are you protecting her?

852
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Why are you protecting her?

853
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480
What is your relationship?

854
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,480
No, You Huang.

855
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Listen to me first. This is a complicated matter.

856
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,480
Sit down first.

857
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Let's talk about it.

858
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
He Qunlian.

859
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
You ran away from the wedding for her.

860
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
What else can we talk about?

861
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I will kill her now.

862
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Brother, are you okay?

863
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Brother, are you okay?

864
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Why is You Huang in the picture?

865
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Why is You Huang in the picture?

866
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Maybe he came here to solve the case.

867
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Maybe he came here to solve the case.

868
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Maybe he came here to solve the case.

869
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Is he also the painter?

870
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Is he also the painter?

871
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Let's use the needle to stab him.

872
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Let's use the needle to stab him.

873
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
You...

874
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
He Qunlian.

875
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
We have been in love for more than ten years.

876
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
We have been in love for more than ten years.

877
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
You want to poison me for a little white face.

878
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
You want to poison me for a little white face.

879
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Where are you going?

880
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I'm so scared.

881
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Little white face?

882
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
No need to try.

883
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Such a dead man is definitely a seducer.

884
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
No, he looks like this.

885
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,480
We can't wake him up.

886
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
You have tried many ways before.

887
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
You can't change it.

888
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
What should I do?

889
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Just leave him here like this?

890
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I know.

891
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,480
You can't kill him.

892
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,480
He won't ruin our business.

893
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,480
He won't ruin our business.

894
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,480
You are too much.

895
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,480
You are too much.

896
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
How can you poison me with such a loud voice?

897
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
If I can get out of here,

898
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
If I can get out of here,

899
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,480
I can't let you go.

900
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480
I can't let you go.

901
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,480
Hu Luo Ping Yang Wei Quan Qi.

902
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Hu Luo Ping Yang Wei Quan Qi.

903
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Hu Luo Ping Yang Wei Quan Qi.

904
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Why don't we

905
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
tell him the truth?

906
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Tell him the truth?

907
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,480
Then you try.

908
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Listen to me.

909
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
You are not the young master of the Huang family.

910
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Your name is Chu You Huang.

911
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Your name is Chu You Huang.

912
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
You are my friend.

913
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
So what we have to do now

914
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
is to escape from the flowers together.

915
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,480
Do you understand?

916
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480
Is that so?

917
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,480
Yes.

918
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,480
You can kill me.

919
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,480
You dare to be friends with others

920
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,480
and make me marry a monk.

921
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Why do you lie to me?

922
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
You are a bad guy

923
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
and a bad girl.

924
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
You are a perfect match.

925
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
You are a bad guy and a bad girl.

926
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,480
You are a bad guy and a bad girl.

927
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,480
You are a bad guy and a bad girl.

928
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
You are right.

929
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480
You can just leave him here.

930
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,480
In the mirror

931
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
I capture the night's

932
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
welcome

933
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,480
What is

934
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
in the destiny

935
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
is parallel

936
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
Don't wake up the dreamer

937
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
in the rain

938
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
slowly

939
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
engrave your face

940
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,480
To withstand the long night

941
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
wind and rain

942
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,480
I can stand in that side of the street

943
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,480
waiting for the end of the road

944
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
maybe I can meet you

945
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,480
through that long night

946
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,480
answer me

947
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,480
I want to fly

948
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
to the bottom

949
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,480
into the sea

950
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
In the mountains and rivers

951
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
I can see you

952
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,480
Staying

953
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
in the dream

954
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,480
is not enough

955
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,480
If memories will be pushed back in destiny

956
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,480
If dust will fall again

957
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
in the future

958
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
I will be there

959
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
with you

960
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
If memories will be pushed back in destiny

961
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,480
I will be there

962
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,480
with you

963
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
I will be there

964
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
with you

965
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,480
I will be there

966
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
with you

967
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
If dust will rise again

968
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,480
after the fall

969
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,480
In the light of time

970
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Who is waiting for the wind to rise

971
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,480
Memories are a memory of half a year

972
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,480
A life of

973
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
real and unbreakable

974
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,480
renunciation

975
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,480
One day is not shy

976
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,480
One day is a promise

977
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,480
I would be unparalleled

978
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,480
in every dream and rhythm

979
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
Like a gust of wind

980
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,480
blowing through my heart

981
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
A night is like a sand storm

982
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
A night is like a river

983
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,480
We work together

984
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480
to embrace each other

985
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
The clouds

986
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,480
are rising

987
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,480
and falling

988
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
I'm sorry.

989
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
I'm sorry.

990
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
I'm sorry.

991
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I'm sorry.

992
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
I'm sorry.

993
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm sorry.

994
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
I'm sorry.

995
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
I'm sorry.

996
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
I'm sorry.

997
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,480
I'm sorry.

998
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
I'm sorry.

999
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,480
I'm sorry.

1000
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
I'm sorry.

1001
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,480
I'm sorry.

1002
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,480
I'm sorry.

1003
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,480
I'm sorry.

1004
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
I'm sorry.

1005
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm sorry.

1006
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
I'm sorry.

1007
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
I'm sorry.

1008
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,480
I'm sorry.

1009
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
I'm sorry.

1010
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,480
I'm sorry.

1011
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
I'm sorry.

1012
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
I'm sorry.

1013
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
I'm sorry.

1014
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
I'm sorry.

1015
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
I'm sorry.

1016
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,480
I'm sorry.
