00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,780
No

5
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Hey

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,840
Hey

7
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Episode 1

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
Ba Xia, have you ever thought that

9
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,280
if you can't see the demon,

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,800
what will happen?

11
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,560
The days are passing so fast.

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
The family's relationship is closer.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,080
You go to study, study, learn to ride a horse.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,680
Maybe you'll have a five-pointed sword.

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Isn't this a lotus-leaf lotus?

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,640
Do you like living like that?

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes, I do.

18
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,000
If so, I can't meet you.

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,280
When life turns innocent,

20
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,080
it becomes punishment for love.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,240
My lady…

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,440
picks seekers!

23
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,400
Have you woken up?

24
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,520
Yes, yes.

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm OK.

26
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm OK.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Go away!

28
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
Go away!

29
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,000
Go away!

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,840
You stinky sheep!

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,720
You stinky sheep!

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,400
What are you doing?

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,680
I said you two are going to die.

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,080
You're not going to die!

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
Are you okay?

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Go!

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,160
Go back!

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
You can't take him!

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,240
Be careful!

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,560
You again?

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,680
Why?

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm the one who's the boss.

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
What does it have to do with you?

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,760
Go!

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,600
Don't be a fool!

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Go away!

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,560
You're the one who's not ashamed.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,480
You're the one who's really ashamed.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
You're a fool who's lazy.

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
If you touch him again,

51
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,640
will you believe I'll take you to the police?

52
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,120
You're the one who's not ashamed.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,320
The boss should be the boss.

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,480
The police?

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,160
Do you know where the sheep's door is?

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,400
You little girl.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
You want to fool me?

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,000
You can't fool yourself.

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,960
I'm not afraid to tell you.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
My dad is in the sheep's room.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm very familiar with the details.

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
If you don't believe me,

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,760
you can come with me.

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,960
When you're in jail,

65
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,280
I'll see if you dare to sell your sheep here.

66
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,240
You little girl!

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,520
Lock him up!

68
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,440
Lock him up!

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Who are you?

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,080
Who are you?

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,640
Get out of here!

72
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,760
Get out of here!

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,640
Get out of here!

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,960
Get out of here!

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,080
Get out of here!

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,280
Get out of here!

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Get out of here!

78
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,200
Miss Tang.

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,080
It's not your first time to bully me.

80
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
I've saved you twice.

81
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,160
I can't save you every time.

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
You've been waiting for someone to save you.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
What if you get in danger next time?

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,920
No one will appear in time

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
to save you.

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,440
Miss, you're fighting again.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,400
If someone knows,

88
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,760
he'll be mad.

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,400
That bride is too stupid.

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,880
Miss, you've helped him so many times.

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,640
He's still unhappy.

92
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,800
He doesn't want to leave his family

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,240
and go to the other side of the world.

94
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
If I say,

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,840
even if you help him a thousand times,

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
he'll be soft.

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,640
It's useless.

98
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
Miss,

99
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
are you listening to me?

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Tingzhao,

101
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,600
when I was getting in the water,

102
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
did you hear a man's voice?

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
There were so many people in the dark.

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Except for women, it was a man.

105
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Miss, which one did you say?

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
Miss,

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
what did you hear?

108
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
I didn't hear anything.

109
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Miss, you must have been having a stomachache.

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm sorry, Master.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
Miss was in the South Yang Old Town.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
She was shocked by the face of that man.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
She didn't even get to the square.

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
She didn't even take a few days off.

115
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
She was busy moving.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
This time,

117
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,000
I was in a stomachache again.

118
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Okay.

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,200
My clothes are almost dry.

120
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Let's go.

121
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:36,560
The

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
their gifts are so pretty and crisp.

123
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
When Sister Jinli was still around,

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
she would come with me to their house.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,600
The boss is a little...

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
She can't handle it anymore.

127
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
You help me to get the money.

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
The boss wants this one.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll give the money.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Here.

131
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you, thank you.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's okay.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,160
This is for you.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
It's very sweet.

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,160
Take it.

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
Here you are.

137
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Thank you.

138
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,640
Thank you.

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,480
Let's go.

140
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,640
Let's go.

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,840
Dad,

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,080
the expensive bottle is here.

143
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,400
Okay.

144
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,480
It's all broken.

145
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay.

146
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,520
Hurry up.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,560
Here you are.

148
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
The little girl.

149
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
What's in your basket?

150
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
Is it delicious?

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,360
Can you give me some?

152
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Please give it to Uncle Jiu.

153
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,120
And,

154
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
don't call me the little girl.

155
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,880
This house is a bit old.

156
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
And,

157
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,160
it's all business.

158
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
It's hard to make a scene.

159
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,000
It's hard to make a scene.

160
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
We met in Nanyang City

161
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,760
when we were in the crowd.

162
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,280
Now, I remember.

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm afraid.

164
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
I can only feel at ease

165
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,800
when I'm with you.

166
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,560
Actually,

167
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,480
I was afraid when I married him.

168
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
But, I got used to it.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,760
People can't be scared

170
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,200
by those things.

171
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,920
Right?

172
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm back.

173
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,640
Bansha, come.

174
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Hello, aunt.

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
Where have you been?

176
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
Why are you sweating?

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,080
Where have you been?

178
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
I went to see a friend.

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,000
He's so sweet.

180
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
I think Bansha is a good girl.

181
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,560
Have you ever been in a relationship?

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
I've been in a relationship.

183
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,120
I remember your son

184
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
is one-sided.

185
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,200
Right?

186
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
He's already married.

187
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,120
He'll be married

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
in the New Year.

189
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,320
Okay.

190
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,560
He's married?

191
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
Miss, you…

192
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,960
Miss, you're still sleeping.

193
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,880
Get a medication.

194
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Otherwise, what's the problem?

195
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,340
Miss, you don't like

196
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,020
my lord with

197
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,360
your gallstones?

198
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,520
comma your Violence drive.

199
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,360
I thought you couldn't

200
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
give her a seizure.

201
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,280
Give him or I'll desecrate!

202
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,000
Give him or I'll desecrate!

203
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,200
Don't go after him.

204
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Yes.

205
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Fortunately, no outsiders are here today.

206
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Otherwise, these words can't be spread out by the sky.

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
It's a stormy rain again.

208
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm not sick.

209
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I know you're not sick.

210
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
It's just that you have a lot of talk and you don't have time to think.

211
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
You're still crying on your face, right?

212
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
But, you're sick.

213
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
You're so angry.

214
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
For example, everyone didn't believe that the bride was a demon.

215
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Only you immediately believed in the words of your wife.

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Miss, how did you find out that the bride was a demon?

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
I don't know either.

218
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It's just that I saw Sister Man Yang with a strange feeling.

219
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,200
There were some fears and some doubts.

220
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Miss, this is the first time you've seen a bride.

221
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
How did you get so many feelings?

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Man Xia.

223
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Mom.

224
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
This is from your uncle Jiu.

225
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
He said that when you're dreaming at night, you can be alone.

226
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
You can rest in peace.

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Chen Xun, come out and help me.

228
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Coming.

229
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Theseae.

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Okay.

231
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
What's going on?

232
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
I'd like to see a hidden money chest.

233
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,280
Let's talk after I fall down there

234
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,700
Look on your face

235
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
This AGAIN???

236
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
My heart flows

237
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,640
Thanks

238
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,200
Certain..

239
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,740
I can somehow

240
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,900
defeat him in battle thoughts.

241
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,180
Am I right?

242
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
own

243
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,860
Miss Dang

244
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,280
Fairy statue

245
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,980
really you?

246
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,700
If you weren't наконец

247
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
I've made up my mind.

248
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,700
Congratulations.

249
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,700
I have to thank Miss Duan.

250
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,860
If you hadn't helped me

251
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,060
and helped me,

252
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,260
I wouldn't have been able to play the piano.

253
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,460
You're still angry.

254
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,340
I heard that the owner of this stream

255
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,700
is Qin Dao.

256
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,300
The musician Xunchang is hard to play the piano here.

257
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,700
Can you explain your high-end music?

258
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,500
What high-end music?

259
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,300
I haven't played it for years.

260
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,500
Thanks to Mr. Bai,

261
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,300
I was able to play the piano.

262
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
That's why I found the place.

263
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,500
Mr. Bai?

264
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,900
Mr. Bai is a friend of Qin Dao.

265
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,300
He's as kind as you.

266
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,900
He's so hardworking

267
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,500
that he's been so hardworking.

268
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,900
Good.

269
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
Good.

270
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,700
Good.

271
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,100
Good.

272
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,700
Good.

273
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,300
Miss Duan, it's my turn.

274
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
I'll play it later.

275
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,700
Go ahead.

276
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Go ahead.

277
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,500
Mr. Bai.

278
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
Go ahead.

279
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,900
Go ahead.

280
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,300
Mr. Bai, be careful.

281
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,500
We're waiting here.

282
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,300
Xiao'ai,

283
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,100
do you have a seat?

284
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,100
Sir,

285
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,300
why don't you order a dish first?

286
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,700
There's a place called Kongwei.

287
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,900
Okay.

288
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
One bowl of Chinese cabbage,

289
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
one bowl of glutinous rice noodles,

290
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
and one bowl of rice pudding.

291
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,900
Okay.

292
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,100
Please.

293
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,500
Sir, do you like your dish?

294
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
I'm going back to the tent.

295
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Take care.

296
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,700
Go, go, go.

297
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Sir.

298
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Duan.

299
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Have we met before?

301
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,700
You must be mistaken.

302
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,900
It's my first time here.

303
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
I don't know you.

304
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm leaving.

305
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
Think about it.

306
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
I don't know why.

307
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
You're always familiar.

308
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,300
I'm Duan Banxia.

309
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Have we met before?

310
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
No.

311
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Thank you, sir.

312
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,900
You're so kind.

313
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,700
Are you here for a business trip?

314
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,100
Or for business?

315
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,500
Or for a visit?

316
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,500
Where do you live?

317
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,300
Are you living in the hotel?

318
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,300
Or in your friend's house?

319
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,100
Sir, you've been here for days.

320
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,700
You're here for a long time.

321
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
You're here for a long time.

322
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
You're here for a long time.

323
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
You're here for a long time.

324
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
You're here for a long time.

325
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
You're here for a long time.

326
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
Do you want to go for a walk?

327
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,300
Your feet hurt.

328
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
It hurts.

329
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
It hurts.

330
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,700
But I have a good medicine at home.

331
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,100
It's the wine doctor

332
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
who went to the doctor's house next to us.

333
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,300
He's the best doctor in Guangping.

334
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,700
I'm home.

335
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,300
Thank you for today.

336
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,700
You just got back to the inn, right?

337
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
The nearest one in Linan

338
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,900
should be the Judo building.

339
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,300
Are you staying there?

340
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
It should be like this.

341
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm here.

342
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,500
I don't know the name of the man.

343
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,100
My name is Man Ying.

344
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,700
Man Ying.

345
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,900
The place where the gold is.

346
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,300
The place where the dragon is.

347
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,700
Man Ying is the star of the gold.

348
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,300
I wonder if you're from the gold.

349
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,500
How long do you want to stay in Guangping?

350
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,900
I'm leaving.

351
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
When will you come back?

352
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,700
I won't come back.

353
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,300
I've been dreaming of

355
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,500
the same dream as you.

356
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
There's a man in my dream.

357
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,500
He's about the same height as you.

358
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,700
But I can't see his face clearly.

359
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,900
Every time I walk past him,

360
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,500
he's already awake.

361
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,900
Someone told me

362
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,700
that the man you saw before

363
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,500
was the one in your dream.

364
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,700
So I've been thinking

365
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,500
if he was the one I saw before.

366
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,100
I've seen him before.

367
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
But I've forgotten.

368
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,700
I saw you at the shop.

369
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I felt familiar.

370
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
So I pulled you in.

371
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,900
I know it's a bit rude.

372
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,700
But I still want to ask you.

373
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,300
You've never been to Guangping.

374
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,300
Have we really never seen each other?

375
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,300
Never.

376
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Jingyang.

377
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,100
Thank you for taking me back today.

378
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm done.

379
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm leaving.

380
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,100
Miss.

381
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,100
Who's that young man?

382
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,500
Miss.

383
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
What's wrong with your foot?

384
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,100
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,100
I remember you.

387
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,100
Why are you here?

388
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm here.

389
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Senior.

390
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
You can't eat so much.

391
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,300
You're on the stage.

392
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,700
Dr. Jiu sent you money.

393
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,900
I didn't give you money.

394
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,300
I didn't give you much.

395
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm full.

396
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,900
Last time, in the group chat,

397
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
the one who helped us to get back was you.

398
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,700
He was so blind.

399
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,900
He had a knife.

400
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,300
He cut the knife off the sky with a knife.

401
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
How did you know me?

402
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,100
I smelled you after three days.

403
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,300
When did your nose get so good?

404
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I didn't expect that.

405
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,300
I practiced the five-stage exercise.

406
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,700
I'm a good student.

407
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm good at it.

408
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,500
Especially the embroidery.

409
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,500
Boss, don't add garlic.

410
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,500
I don't eat garlic.

411
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,700
You're a bastard.

412
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,900
It's so good with garlic.

413
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,900
You smiled.

414
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Do you admit it?

415
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,100
Come on.

416
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,100
Eat more.

417
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,100
My master said you're not hungry.

418
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,900
He told me not to go to you.

419
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,500
He said you went to the door.

420
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,500
Yes.

421
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,500
You're a good student.

422
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,500
But you're not good at playing cards.

423
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,900
You can't bring your old skills to the field.

424
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
You just accept me.

425
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,300
But he said I only learned from him.

426
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,100
I don't want to pass the exam.

427
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
I can accept him again sooner or later.

428
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,100
But I think he can't accept me.

429
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Why?

430
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
He has a look of a successor.

431
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,700
He has to find a student like that.

432
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,100
There are too many requirements.

433
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,100
Can't find him.

434
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Eat slowly.

435
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Here, this bowl is for you.

436
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,700
It's been a long time since I've had a big meal.

437
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,300
I've been busy lately.

438
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,100
What?

439
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,300
I'm getting married.

440
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,700
My father-in-law will renovate the house.

441
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
That's a good thing.

442
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,900
Who is he going to marry?

443
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,300
The daughter of the street doctor.

444
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,500
My father-in-law went to his shop to collect herbs.

445
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,100
He's familiar with them.

446
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,500
He's a good teacher.

447
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,100
Do you like him?

448
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
I don't know.

449
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,700
But let me tell you.

450
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,500
I think he's a little silly recently.

451
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,700
Sometimes he writes.

452
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
He writes and writes.

453
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,500
Suddenly he smiles.

454
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,500
He looks a little sick.

455
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
I don't know if the bride will like him.

456
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,900
By the way.

457
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,100
Thank you for that.

458
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
The teacher said that if you didn't show up,

459
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
it would be hard for us to stop all the ghosts.

460
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,700
If the ghosts run away, that would be troublesome.

461
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
You're my friend from now on.

462
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,500
Friend?

463
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,100
Friend.

464
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Okay.

465
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,900
Friend.

466
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I'm going home.

467
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,900
Wait.

468
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
The groom's body is so good.

469
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,500
Is it pretty?

470
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
It's pretty.

471
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
It's pretty.

472
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,700
It's pretty.

473
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
Boss.

474
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Okay, okay.

475
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Thank you.

476
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
You're so happy.

477
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,100
You want to eat again?

478
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
No.

479
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,100
It smells like the meat of the pig.

480
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
It's very fragrant.

481
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,100
The teacher loves to eat this.

482
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Wait a minute.

483
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
You're so good.

484
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
You're my brother from now on.

485
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
No, I'm not.

486
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
I'm not.

487
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
I'm your brother.

488
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Aren't you my friend?

489
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
You're not that generous.

490
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
You're my family.

491
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
You're my brother.

492
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
I'm here.

493
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Go back.

494
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Zhi Xue?

495
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Why did that kid come back?

496
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
What did you find, teacher?

497
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm hungry.

498
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
I remember that I lost all of my money.

499
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
What's the smell?

500
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
What's in your hand?

501
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
What's in your hand?

502
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
The meat of the pig.

503
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Fresh and fresh.

504
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
You like it.

505
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Hurry up.

506
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Put it on.

507
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
The meat of the pig.

508
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
That's great.

509
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Dad.

510
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Zhi Xue.

511
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,100
What are you eating?

512
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Your nose is pretty.

513
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Sit down.

514
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Let's eat together.

515
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Okay.

516
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Come on.

517
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
So many delicious food.

518
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
I can't believe I didn't add any wine.

519
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
You're right.

520
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Go, go, go.

521
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Take out the good wine.

522
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Okay, I'll go get it.

523
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
Wait for me.

524
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Dad, the wine is here.

525
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
You're all laughing.

526
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Don't be afraid of your mother.

527
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
We'll be scolded if we don't.

528
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Pour it for you.

529
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Dad, you're so biased.

530
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
You didn't give me the money

531
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
for Zhi Xue's Ling Hua.

532
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
I wanted to buy a book yesterday.

533
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
But I didn't have enough money.

534
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
You're not lying.

535
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I didn't give Zhi Xue Ling Hua money.

536
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
My master didn't give me money.

537
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
This is what my brother bought.

538
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Your brother?

539
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
The one from the reunion inn.

540
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
The one with the knife.

541
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
I told you.

542
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Don't go to him.

543
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
I didn't.

544
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
He just passed by the alley

545
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
near the store.

546
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
I bumped into him.

547
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
I gave him a call.

548
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
He insisted on buying me food.

549
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
He bought me new clothes.

550
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
I bought you some meat

551
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
when I came back.

552
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Why is he so rich?

553
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Our Zuo Yao needs money.

554
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,100
We have to pay for it.

555
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
You're so ridiculous.

556
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
You're so ridiculous.

557
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
You're not getting married to your wife.

558
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
You need to repair the garden.

559
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
You need to repair the roof.

560
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
It's all for you.

561
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
It's all for you.

562
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
It's all for you.

563
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
Come on.

564
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Come on.

565
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
You're so ridiculous.

566
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Come on.

567
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Cheers.

568
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Cheers.

569
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Daxia.

570
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
I once thought

571
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
if we didn't meet,

572
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
what would your life be like?

573
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
I don't know.

574
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I don't know.

575
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
I don't know.

576
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
I don't know.

577
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
I don't know.

578
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
I don't know.

579
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I don't know.

580
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I don't know.

581
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
I don't know.

582
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
I don't know.

583
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
I don't know.

584
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,100
I don't know.

585
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't know.

586
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
I don't know.

587
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
I don't know.

588
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
I don't know.

589
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
I don't know.

590
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
I don't know.

591
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
I don't know.

592
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
I don't know.

593
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
I don't know.

594
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
I don't know.

595
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
I don't know.

596
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I don't know.

597
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
I don't know.

598
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
I don't know.

599
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
I don't know.

600
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
I don't know.

601
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
I don't know.

602
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
I don't know.

603
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I don't know.

604
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I don't know.

605
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
I don't know.

606
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I don't know.

607
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
I don't know.

608
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
I don't know.

609
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
I don't know.

610
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I don't know.

611
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
I don't know.

612
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
I don't know.

613
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
I don't know.

614
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
I don't know.

615
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
I don't know.

616
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
I don't know.

617
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
I don't know.

618
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
I don't know.

619
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I don't know.

620
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
I don't know.

621
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
I don't know.

622
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
I don't know.

623
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
I don't know.

624
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I don't know.

625
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
I don't know.

626
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I don't know.

627
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
I don't know.

628
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
I don't know.

629
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
I don't know.

630
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
I don't know.

631
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
I don't know.

632
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Hurry up, mom and dad.

633
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Look.

634
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Look.

635
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Dad, mom, look.

636
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Is my rabbit beautiful?

637
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Yes.

638
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Be careful.

639
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
Mom, when you get to school,

640
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
you should take good care of your parents.

641
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
Okay, mom.

642
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
I'll read the book for you when you get back.

643
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Okay.

644
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
Here's your duck leg.

645
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Drink some.

646
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Thank you, mom.

647
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Here's one for you.

648
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I like duck legs.

649
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
They like this.

650
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Here.

651
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
I like this, too.

652
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
Here.

653
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
Eat more.

654
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Ha!

655
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Dad, let me help you.

656
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Okay.

657
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:23,100
I am not a cowikat.

658
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
My name is Chen-ye,

659
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
I'll drink first.

660
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
You'll drink first.

661
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
I'll drink first.

662
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
I really like you.

663
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
But I don't know when it started.

664
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Maybe it's a long time ago.

665
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
But I can swear with my life.

666
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
If you're willing to marry me,

667
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,100
I'll be honest and honest with you for life.

668
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
No matter if there's any danger,

669
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
I'll live with my life.

670
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,100
I'll be honest with you for life.

671
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Anxia.

672
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm sorry.

673
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Anxia.

674
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Anxia.

675
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Anxia.

676
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Anxia.

677
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
Anxia.

678
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
How is it?

679
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Here.

680
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Is it enough?

681
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Or not?

682
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
There should be more in Gan Shan Hall.

683
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,100
The old man with the wine is not good at making trouble.

684
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Can you do it?

685
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
By the way,

686
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
I have to go to Yangxi County.

687
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
There's a bear nest there.

688
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I'll be there.

689
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Be careful.

690
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I know.

691
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
No matter what,

692
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
it's more than ten days before the gate is closed.

693
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
We have to go back before the gate is closed.

694
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Okay, I got it.

695
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Did you see that woman again?

696
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Since you like her so much,

697
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
you can take her back to Wuyou.

698
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
But she can't escape the gate.

699
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,100
What else can we do besides being with you every day?

700
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
You're so mean.

701
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,100
Miss.

702
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Miss.

703
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,100
Miss.

704
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Miss.

705
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Anxia.

706
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
ikun Suо.

707
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Miss.

708
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
MIa.

709
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Miss.

710
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Miss.

711
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Okay, thank you.

712
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Ban Xia.

713
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
I can't take it.

714
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Ban Xia.

715
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Ban Xia.

716
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Forget me.

717
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,100
No.

718
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Miss.

719
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Miss.

720
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
What's wrong?

721
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Miss.

722
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Did you have a nightmare?

723
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Good shot.

724
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Really?

725
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
This is Yue Chong.

726
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
You're a demon, right?

727
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
I'm not a demon.

728
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
I'm not a demon.

729
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
I'm not a demon.

730
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
I'm not a demon.

731
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I'm not a demon.

732
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
I'm not a demon.

733
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
I'm not a demon.

734
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Right?

735
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I've heard that

736
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
there are two demons.

737
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
The main thing is to stop them.

738
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Take the evil demon from everywhere

739
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
and collect the spirit.

740
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
And also,

741
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,100
take the high price from other demons.

742
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
I didn't understand it at first.

743
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,100
But after I saw you,

744
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
I knew it.

745
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
You're a demon.

746
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
You came from Wuyou City.

747
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Do you want to cry

748
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
in Wuyou Grass?

749
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
How did you know?

750
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
You can come to the world.

751
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
We can go to Wuyou City.

752
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
I went to Dixiacheng

753
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
to find my junior brother

754
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
when I was 12 years old.

755
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
I was lucky to have this opportunity.

756
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
I didn't expect

757
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
there is such a place

758
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
outside the world.

759
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
No wonder

760
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
there are more demons

761
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
in the world

762
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
in the world.

763
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I found out

764
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
that the spirit of the demon

765
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
was born in Wuyou Grass.

766
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
In the Wuyou Mirror,

767
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
the spirit of the demon

768
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
is the spirit of the demon.

769
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
So

770
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
after the demon died,

771
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
the spirit of the demon

772
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,100
returned to the Wuyou Grass

773
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,100
and re-emerged again

774
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,100
to the Wuyou Grass.

775
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
It was a long journey

776
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
and a lot of troubles.

777
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
But after the demon

778
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
died,

779
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
the spirit of the demon

780
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
returned to the Wuyou Mirror.

781
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
This way,

782
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
the Wuyou Mirror

783
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
will be broken sooner or later.

784
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
For so many years,

785
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
you have been collecting the insects

786
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
in the two realms

787
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
and being collected

788
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
to be pushed into the Wuyou Grass.

789
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
You risk your life

790
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
to take it.

791
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Mr. Jiu,

792
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
you are so smart.

793
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
It's over.

794
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
Why did you help me?

795
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Then why did you help me?

796
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
I...

797
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
You are a good man.

798
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
You are a good man.

799
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
I will repay you

800
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,100
for your kindness.

801
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Thank you.

802
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Right.

803
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
I almost forgot.

804
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
My son is about to be married.

805
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,100
I have to go back to the house.

806
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
I haven't eaten yet.

807
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Don't waste it.

808
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
Who is it?

809
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
It's a man.

810
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
He is probably

811
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
so tall.

812
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
His eyes are so big

813
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
and his nose is so sharp.

814
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
He looks good.

815
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
I remember.

816
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,100
There is a man like him.

817
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,100
But he has left.

818
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
When did he leave?

819
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Last night.

820
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
I don't remember.

821
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
I don't remember.

822
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,100
He left.

823
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
When did he leave?

824
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
He left last night.

825
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
He came to work.

826
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,100
He said he finished his work.

827
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
He left.

828
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Thank you, Mr. Jiu.

829
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,100
It's okay.

830
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
I will introduce you to him.

831
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Miss,

832
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
he has left.

833
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Forget it.

834
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,100
Let's go back.

835
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
I want to hang out alone.

836
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
You go back first.

837
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
But...

838
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
It's okay.

839
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Go back.

840
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I can't do it.

841
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
I will give you a discount.

842
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Tianzi is not so good.

843
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,100
I will go back first.

844
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
You go back early.

845
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
Don't worry.

846
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Just sit down.

847
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
You can put a pot or something.

848
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,100
It's good.

849
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Okay.

850
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
I will light it up.

851
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Okay.

852
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,100
This one.

853
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
Thank you.

854
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
Take it.

855
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,100
It's so cheap.

856
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Why are you sitting down?

857
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,100
Wait.

858
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
I will go back.

859
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Go back.

860
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Go back.

861
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Go back.

862
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
Go back.

863
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,100
I will go back.

864
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,100
Go back.

865
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,100
I will go back.

866
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Okay.

867
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
I will go back.

868
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
I will go back.

869
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,100
We should go to Bi Bi Yu.

870
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,100
Okay.

871
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,100
I had a dream again last night.

872
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,100
But I didn't realize that

873
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,100
The people in my dreams

874
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,100
I never felt it.

875
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,100
It was strange...

876
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,100
Like ever before.

877
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,900
But there is no oil

878
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,900
Like what happened in life

879
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,900
Mr. Man Ying

880
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,300
Do you think there is really a dream in this world?

881
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,500
Because I drink not enough

882
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,300
So I can't forget the past life

883
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,300
You really haven't seen me

884
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,300
We really don't know each other

885
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
Then do you have a strange dream

886
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Someone called your name in the dream

887
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,300
Tell you to forget him

888
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
Do you really have no impression on me?

889
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,300
No

890
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,300
Then fine

891
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,300
Maybe I'm a doctor and I'm going to be discharged

892
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,300
I didn't tell you

893
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,300
My family said I had a problem with my brain

894
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,300
I have a depression

895
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
Since I was a child

896
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,300
I took a lot of medicine

897
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,300
I didn't see much doctor

898
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Maybe it's time to take more medicine

899
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
I know some medical skills

900
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,300
This is not a big problem

901
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,300
As long as you eat well

902
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,300
Sleep well

903
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,300
Rest well

904
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,300
It will get better slowly

905
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,300
Don't eat medicine

906
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,300
Ok

907
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,300
I'll leave you alone

908
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,300
It's raining outside

909
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
It's raining

910
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,300
Take the umbrella

911
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,300
The moon is shining

912
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,300
The wind is blowing

913
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,300
You forgot

914
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,300
To take a big picture

915
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,300
I'm still in the dream

916
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,300
You really won't come to Guangping again?

917
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,300
The land is far away

918
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
The net is not in sight

919
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
I won't talk to you

920
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
Then fine

921
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,300
I wish you a safe journey

922
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
May you live a long life

923
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,300
No worries and no worries

924
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
I will be with you

925
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,300
Thank you

926
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,300
The world is full of darkness

927
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,300
The world is full of hope

928
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,300
The moon is shining

929
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,300
The wind is blowing

930
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,300
You forgot

931
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
To take a big picture

932
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,300
I'm still in the dream

933
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,300
You really won't come to Guangping again?

934
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,300
The world is full of darkness

935
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,300
The wind is blowing

936
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,300
You forgot

937
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,300
To take a big picture

938
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,300
I'm still in the dream

939
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,300
You really won't come to Guangping again?

940
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,300
The land is far away

941
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,300
The net is not in sight

942
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,300
I won't talk to you

943
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,300
I won't talk to you

944
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,300
I won't talk to you

945
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,300
I won't talk to you

946
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,300
I won't talk to you

947
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
I won't talk to you

948
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,300
I won't talk to you

949
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,300
I won't talk to you

950
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,300
I won't talk to you

951
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
The world is full of darkness

952
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,300
The wind is blowing

953
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,300
You forgot

954
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,300
You forgot

955
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,300
To take a big picture

956
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,300
I'm still in the dream

957
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,300
You really won't come to Guangping again?

958
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,300
The world is full of darkness

959
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,300
The wind is blowing

960
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,300
You forgot

961
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,300
To take a big picture

962
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,300
I'm still in the dream

963
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,300
You really won't come to Guangping again?

964
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,300
The world is full of darkness

965
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
You don't need to think

966
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,300
Not to love the world

967
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,300
But forget

968
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,300
To be captured by everything

969
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,300
I won't be able to repeat

970
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,300
In the world of hate
