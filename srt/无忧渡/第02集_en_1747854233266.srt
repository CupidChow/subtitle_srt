1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,700
Seven-Aroll

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hope you are happy.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hope you are happy.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hope you are happy.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hope you are happy.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hope you are happy.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hope you are happy.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is this?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Check now,

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
can you see it?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:24,880
New

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The meeting is fate.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The mountain demon is more focused on fate than us.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is their treat.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If you don't drink, you'll be punished.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sorry.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Cheating.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't waste it.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
sacrifice

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's for barbed wire.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm going to the mountain

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is that a mountain demon?

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Can mountains become demons?

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A big mountain passes through the sun and the moon

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A small flower, bird, fish, and insect

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
As long as you get the soul of the source, you can practice to become a demon

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
To be honest

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
People are the same

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The spirit is not yet enlightened

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's just a group of blood and flesh

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When the spirit is enlightened, you can know the etiquette

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Focus on the evil, and know the right and wrong

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Become the treasure of the spirit

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What is Yuan Ling?

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A kind of demon

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can understand it as a seed

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you get it, you can become smart

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Practice the demon's method

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Live a long life

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The winner can call the wind and rain

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Change into a human

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The bottle of medicine you gave me

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Can you sell me a bottle?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You want to give it to your brother

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can't use it either

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I just helped you to open your eyes

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because your body is special

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But for others

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Knowing that there are demons in this world

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It may not be a good thing

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then what else can you do

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let my brother become the only one

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Get rid of your family's disaster

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This demon is known as the human face

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a demon of the past

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The face is thin

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The tail is full

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The human face in the legend

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is a disaster

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a great disaster

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But that's just a rumor

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The human face I've seen

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Like other demons

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Just good at changing

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Eat people's monkeys

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Every time you eat a monkey

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The human face can take seven lives

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So the human face

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can make hundreds of sounds

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's very scary

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This medicine is called bitter monkey

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It can temporarily save your brother's life

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That demon

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Should be attracted to your brother's voice

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He used to harm people in Guangping City

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Also because of the sound of people

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He bit off the other person's throat

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I chased him all the way

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just want to get rid of this disaster

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't expect to be mistreated by your brother

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If he hadn't been busy these days

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I didn't go back to the house

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Young master

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm afraid I've been taken by that demon

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Miss miss

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The big prince is back

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Come back

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you okay, miss

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on, take it out

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Brother

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Banxia

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're back

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did the bad guys catch it?

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The government has already set up a network of hell

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The thief will be angry sooner or later

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You don't have to worry

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is there anything else

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I see you don't look too good recently

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I made you some self-sufficient soup

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Drink it while it's hot

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you sister

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We don't need it

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Young master

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You just drink a sip

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Miss went to the chicken room this morning

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've been busy for half a day

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And my hands are still hot

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Very attentive

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hot

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you need medicine?

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Used

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's okay

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You should drink the medicine while it's hot

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What medicine

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why is it so bitter

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The medicine is bitter

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
People say it's all clean

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's useful if you don't have a drop left

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you sister

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm leaving

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm leaving

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What is this

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll have to take it

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Take it

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll take it

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll take it

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll take it

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll take it

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll take it

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Miss, come and wash your face.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Miss, are you cold?

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm fine.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's getting late. Hurry and go to bed.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm not sleepy yet. You go to sleep first.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm going to sleep.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Madam, Young Madam is here to greet you.

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let her in.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm going to sleep.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm Man Er.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm here to greet you, grandmother.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Grandma.

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Get up.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you, grandmother.

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm not very well.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've been ill for two days.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm late to greet you and grandmother.

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Please forgive me.

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That day, there were many thieves in the house.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Qiu'er said you were frightened.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Are you feeling better now?

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm used to it.

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm fine now.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Although we're not a big family,

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we don't have many family members.

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But basically,

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we're all friends.

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But we still have to keep our basic etiquette.

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Since you're married,

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
forget about what you were like before.

202
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
In the future, you have to invite your family

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to return to your home.

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Serve your husband well.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't let him down.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He's very fond of you.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're right, grandmother.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll remember it.

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Sit down.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, grandmother.

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sit down.

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I heard from my husband

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that you made him a bowl of medicine yesterday.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He's very fond of it.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I wonder where you got this medicine from.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can you please give me the prescription?

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you need it,

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can give you one.

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're so kind.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why don't you come to my room later?

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, I'm busy today.

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's the matter?

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I saw your hair was white a few days ago.

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I want to buy some black beans

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to make soy milk and dye your hair.

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm so grateful.

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Your father is a lucky man.

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Unlike your uncle and I,

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm not like your mother.

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll leave you, grandmother.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Xuan Yi, you're not here.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My aunt is here alone.

233
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
She's busy during the day.

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
She has many people around her.

235
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Did you remember the things I told you?

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Xuan Yi, your opponent...

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He's fast.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll help you deal with him.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You go back first.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't need you here.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't forget about tonight.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Dr. Jiu, it's been a long time.

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're always eating and drinking.

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're very leisurely.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm not as energetic as you.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're so hardworking.

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was lost when I came here.

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was delayed for two days.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Is this your trick?

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm a fraud in your heart.

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What trick is this?

253
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Show me the document.

254
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't have it.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You don't have it?

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If you enter the network,

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you must have the document.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you don't, you're a fraud.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I can only take you back to Guangping.

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't have the document.

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Isn't it your trick?

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's just a way.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's clearly written in the law.

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The most shallow and the most controversial

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
are not related to the country.

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Six years ago,

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
there were six cases of people in Changping.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you remember?

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Please have a look.

270
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Don't be nervous.

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I didn't come with you.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I came to Nanyang

273
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to solve the case.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But it's a coincidence.

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Where there is a case of life,

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
there is Dr. Jiu.

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Dr. Jiu really likes to make trouble.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The case of Ge Hou was done by a demon.

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You can't handle it.

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's a demon again.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Just like Dr. Jiu's family was destroyed six years ago,

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it was done by a demon.

283
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm a man of the flesh.

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Even if I know you're a murderer,

285
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I can't make you a crime.

286
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't believe

287
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that others believe you.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Chu Butou,

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I've already said it.

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you're injured or dead

291
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
because of the wall,

292
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
don't blame me.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Waiter,

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
a bill, please.

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You can order

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
what you want to eat.

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you.

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Waiter!

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Waiter!

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Waiter!

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Why are you still going out?

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Father,

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the man has appeared at the government office.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Be careful.

319
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you have enough men?

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Or should we take all the guards in the house?

321
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No need.

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Go!

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hurry up! Follow up!

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Protect Young Master!

325
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes.

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What happened?

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Young Master went out.

356
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Except for Master,

357
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
all the men in the house went with him.

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What's wrong?

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Tingzhao.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Tingzhao.

361
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What's wrong?

362
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Ting...

363
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Tingzhao.

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Isn't my singing good?

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why are you still awake

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
when everyone else is asleep?

367
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Since you can see through me,

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you should know

369
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
that I'm only trying to hurt your brother

370
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
by pulling his fingers.

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I've told you before

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that I really like him

373
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and that I'll be with him forever.

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why don't you believe me?

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You were the one who provoked me

376
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and made things difficult for me.

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm not to blame.

378
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can't keep you anymore.

379
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're quite good at playing tricks.

380
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Young Master.

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Young Master.

382
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Young Master, are you okay?

383
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Young Master is back.

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Grandma. Mother.

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yanqiu,

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
why are you back?

387
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Have you found the thief?

388
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I took someone to track down the program

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
but I failed to test the thief's identity.

390
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm back with Xian.

391
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're more relieved

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
after your sister was frightened.

393
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm much better.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Thank you for your concern.

395
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm asking you about your sister-in-law.

396
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I heard from Xia Ran that after I left,

397
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Man Niang came to your yard.

398
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Is that true?

399
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes.

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
She was also taken away by the thief?

401
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

402
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You two don't know each other.

403
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Why did she come here?

404
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't know either.

405
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The thief came as soon as she entered.

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I heard from Qingzhou

407
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
that she found your father sitting on the floor

408
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and was in a state of panic.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You were awake.

410
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Did you see the thief's face

411
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and the same person who came last time?

412
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I didn't see it clearly.

413
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How could you not see it clearly?

414
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You were there when I came.

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This time, you came to your room.

416
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Did you know the thief?

417
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You...

418
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Enough.

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What are you asking?

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Your sister is tired.

421
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let her rest.

422
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Grandma, Man Niang was taken away.

423
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
She's still alive.

424
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I need to know more information

425
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
before I can get her back.

426
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The thief

427
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
came to the door one by one.

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He came to you

429
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because he wanted to see your husband.

430
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What's the use of

431
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
asking your sister?

432
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
She's a girl who doesn't go out

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and doesn't sell.

434
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
She's been living in the house for a long time.

435
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
She's not a thief.

436
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But your new wife

437
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
was originally

438
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
in the Gou Lanwa Temple

439
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
in the theater.

440
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know who she was

441
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
when she was alive.

442
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Even if she got married,

443
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
she would be taken away.

444
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Grandma.

445
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Enough.

446
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Mother, Yan Qiu is in a hurry.

447
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
He's upset.

448
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'll take him away.

449
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
An Xia,

450
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
have a good rest.

451
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

452
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm leaving.

453
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I've ordered

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the medicine in the kitchen.

455
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
If your lady wakes up

456
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
in the middle of the night,

457
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
give her another bowl.

458
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yes, Madam.

459
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Your father is not at home.

460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If you have any difficulties,

461
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
you can tell me.

462
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I will

463
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
help you.

464
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll help you.

465
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Grandma,

466
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
don't worry.

467
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I believe

468
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
everything in this world is about the cause and effect.

469
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You are good to people.

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You will protect us

471
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
in the future.

472
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Everything will be fine.

473
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm leaving.

474
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Where are you going?

475
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Little man,

476
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
we used to be

477
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
innocent,

478
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
but why do you

479
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
make it difficult for me?

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Can't you let me go?

481
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You are still so innocent

482
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
at your age.

483
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm leaving.

484
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm leaving.

485
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm leaving.

486
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm leaving.

487
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm leaving.

488
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm leaving.

489
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm leaving.

490
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm leaving.

491
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm leaving.

492
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm leaving.

493
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm leaving.

494
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm leaving.

495
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm leaving.

496
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm leaving.

497
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm leaving.

498
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm leaving.

499
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm leaving.

500
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm leaving.

501
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm leaving.

502
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm leaving.

503
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm leaving.

504
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm leaving.

505
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm leaving.

506
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm leaving.

507
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm leaving.

508
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm leaving.

509
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm leaving.

510
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm leaving.

511
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm leaving.

512
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm leaving.

513
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm leaving.

514
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm leaving.

515
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm leaving.

516
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm leaving.

517
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm leaving.

518
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm leaving.

519
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm leaving.

520
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm leaving.

521
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm leaving.

522
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm leaving.

523
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm leaving.

524
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm leaving.

525
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm leaving.

526
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'll be back.

527
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Miss.

528
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's so late.

529
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Why are you still awake?

530
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

531
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll dye my hair for my dad.

532
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Are you going to dye your hair again?

533
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's not long before you dye your hair.

534
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Miss, don't be mad at me.

535
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Actually,

536
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Mr. Li is a good man.

537
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He knows how to handle horses and horses.

538
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You're still young.

539
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You don't understand.

540
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
By the way, Miss.

541
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll put a letter on the desk for you.

542
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Here.

543
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What letter?

544
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Someone sent it.

545
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You're the one who gave it to Miss.

546
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Who sent it?

547
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The housekeeper at the door didn't tell me.

548
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Did Master write it?

549
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You help me open the pot.

550
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'll go and have a look.

551
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Where is this?

552
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Is anyone there?

553
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't come over.

554
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Where are you going?

555
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't scare her.

556
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
She's scared.

557
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I've never thought about hurting her.

558
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm afraid of her.

559
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm afraid of her.

560
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm afraid of her.

561
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm afraid of her.

562
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm afraid of her.

563
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm afraid of her.

564
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I've never thought about hurting her.

565
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
She came to me first.

566
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You seduced her brother.

567
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Of course she didn't mean it.

568
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What do you mean seduced?

569
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We are in love.

570
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We should be together forever.

571
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
She came to destroy this marriage first.

572
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Good sister.

573
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
How can I punish you for your bad marriage?

574
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Your throat is so beautiful.

575
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll eat it.

576
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll eat it.

577
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Good sister.

578
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Don't run.

579
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You can't run away.

580
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll kill you.

581
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Why did she come to me again?

582
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There's a little accident.

583
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's you again.

584
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm the one who hurt you.

585
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What's your skill?

586
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I've never hurt you.

587
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Why do you keep bothering me?

588
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I can't help it.

589
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You are a demon. I'm a demon hunter.

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm not a man who bothers you.

591
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I told you before.

592
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't want to hurt anyone.

593
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You are too much.

594
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Tell her.

595
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Although I

596
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
hurt many people,

597
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I never thought of hurting her.

598
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I

599
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
really like her.

600
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Is she dead?

601
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes.

602
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Do you want me to take care of it?

603
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
No.

604
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Young master.

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
She's awake.

606
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's fine.

607
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You don't have to be so happy.

608
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
She'll be safe.

609
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't need to be polite.

610
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You fainted last night in front of the life-saving door.

611
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I found it and sent it back.

612
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I was too reckless that day.

613
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't take it to heart.

614
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I heard the maid say that she was sick in the room the other day.

615
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You went to see her.

616
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
She was born in a bad family.

617
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Everyone looked down on her.

618
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm grateful that you can have this kind of heart.

619
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I think that night, the maid was bored in the yard.

620
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I want to talk to you.

621
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I didn't expect to meet that thief.

622
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But you're a weak woman after all.

623
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Now the thief is still out of the law.

624
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You went out alone at night to find him in the place of life-saving.

625
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He is too dangerous.

626
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's not his husband.

628
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
He is also a government official.

629
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I will find him back whether he is dead or alive.

630
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So don't worry about it anymore.

631
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I know.

632
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I have something to do.

633
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm leaving.

634
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Brother.

635
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If sister-in-law can't find it,

636
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I will go to the police station.

637
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Sister-in-law can't find it.

638
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
She will never find it.

639
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What will you do?

640
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Don't think too much.

641
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Have a good rest.

642
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,740
The

643
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
rabbit

644
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The rabbit

645
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The rabbit

646
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The rabbit

647
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Who are you?

648
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Where are you?

649
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Stop.

650
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Stop.

651
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Stop.

652
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Stop.

653
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The rabbit.

654
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The rabbit.

655
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm not the rabbit.

656
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
My surname is Jiu.

657
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
My name is Xuanye.

658
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
My surname is Duanmin.

659
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I know.

660
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I know.

661
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What is this?

662
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
For you.

663
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Food?

664
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Anything else?

665
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Food?

666
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I have eaten everything.

667
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I have some at home.

668
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Forget it.

669
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I can eat.

670
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What do you want?

671
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I want to ask

672
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
if sister-in-law Man Niang is dead?

673
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
She is dead.

674
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
She can't save soldiers.

675
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Just put your heart in her belly.

676
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What?

677
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You seem to be reluctant to leave her.

678
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No.

679
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So, Man Niang and my brother got married

680
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
just to get her voice?

681
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't know.

682
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What she thinks has nothing to do with me.

683
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I only know that

684
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the waist is good and bad.

685
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Once she has the idea of killing people

686
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
or disturbing the safety of civilians,

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
she will be dead.

688
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I advise you

689
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
not to think too much.

690
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
With your eyes like this,

691
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
you are destined to deal with the waist.

692
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The waist is good at seducing people.

693
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
If you don't be careful,

694
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
you will be caught sooner or later.

695
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Okay.

696
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I will go to the toilet.

697
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay.

698
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I will go to the toilet.

699
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay.

700
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I am going back to Guangping.

701
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Do you have any plans?

702
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Plan?

703
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You plan to smell this incense

704
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and lie to yourself that there is no waist in the world?

705
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
My family doesn't like me seeing that.

706
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What about yourself?

707
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I don't like it either.

708
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This time my brother was born with a waist.

709
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There is no way.

710
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But I won't be so unlucky all the time.

711
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Maybe.

712
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But you are deceiving yourself.

713
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You can cheat for a while, but you can't cheat for a lifetime.

714
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
What can I do?

715
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Do I have to do the same thing as you?

716
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't have that big ability.

717
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I just want to be an ordinary person

718
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and live a good life.

719
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Give me your hand.

720
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Give me your hand.

721
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Okay.

722
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
This is the protection seal.

723
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I created it myself.

724
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Even if you encounter a hundred-year-old demon,

725
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
you can fight.

726
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
After that, if you encounter any trouble,

727
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
you can come to Guangping to find me.

728
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I will go to the toilet.

729
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I will go to the toilet.

730
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I will go to the toilet.

731
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I will go to the toilet.

732
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I will go to the toilet.

733
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You can come to Guangping to find me.

734
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Guangping?

735
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Where do you live?

736
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Do you live alone?

737
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Or is it my family?

738
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't have a family.

739
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
If you come to Guangping,

740
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
you can come to Ganshan Hall under Sifang Street, Changping.

741
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Ganshan Hall?

742
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Although I am a sorcerer,

743
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I am also a doctor.

744
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Ganshan Hall is my pharmacy.

745
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Do you have anything else to ask?

746
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
No.

747
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Then go back.

748
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Thank you for today.

749
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I am leaving.

750
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He is really big.

751
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He is a girl.

752
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He is not afraid of the dark mountain road.

753
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I am leaving.

754
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I am leaving.

755
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I am leaving.

756
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I am leaving.

757
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I am leaving.

758
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I am leaving.

759
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I am leaving.

760
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
