1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's start now.

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,720
Do you have that run...

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,300
I'm going to make a

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,440
little bit of a

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,100
little bit of a

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,540
little bit of a

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,540
little bit of a

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,540
little bit of a

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,540
little bit of a

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,540
little bit of a

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,540
little bit of a

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,540
little bit of a

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,540
little bit of a

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,540
little bit of a

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,540
little bit of a

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,100
little bit of a

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,140
little bit of a

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,040
little bit of a

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
little bit of

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,880
a little bit of a

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
little bit of a

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
little bit of a

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,540
little bit of a

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,540
little bit of a

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,540
little bit of a

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,540
little bit of a

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,540
little bit of a

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,540
Dr. Wuchum

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Episode 10

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Sis chick

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,840
Hey.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,680
Miss.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
Do you think Dr. Jiu will be angry with us?

34
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,240
What do you think?

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,280
Does he not care about us anymore?

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Didn't you say that he's lazy and doesn't care about us?

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,760
That empty-headed monk is the real master.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,360
I thought so before.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,880
But when I thought about it,

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,160
we didn't know how an empty-headed monk is.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,720
But Dr. Jiu is always able to beat the waist.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,680
If we don't find him next time, we'll lose our leg.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,040
Isn't that too much?

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't worry.

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,760
This leg won't run away.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,160
It's almost done?

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,440
Look.

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
This is the new one.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,320
Thank you, Dr. Jiu. Goodbye.

50
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
The heart is kind and the hands are gentle.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,520
This is from someone else?

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,720
What are you doing here?

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm going to dye your hair.

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,240
No need.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,600
Why?

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,920
Didn't you ask someone else for help? Why are you here to help me?

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
It's all a misunderstanding.

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm here to expose the real face of a liar.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
Did I tell you before?

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
After I got fired, my father took me to Guangping and went to Yuan Zhou.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,960
There was a wine shop in Yuan Zhou.

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,120
They sold pine and amber wine.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,920
They found the business was bad after a long time.

64
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,840
They investigated and found out that there were people selling these two types of wine in Yuan Zhou.

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,720
But they didn't have good quality wine for money.

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,880
They lost the reputation of these two types of wine.

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,240
Then they couldn't do anything. My father and I had to sell other types of wine.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,000
So you know, no matter how great your ability is,

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,800
you can't be able to get the reputation of your greedy peers.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,480
You work so hard every day, and you're always in the middle of something.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Those fake liars are stepping on your reputation.

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,560
Aren't you angry?

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,240
Are you very angry?

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,160
Of course, I'm angry.

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm your friend.

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,120
Then what did you do?

77
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,520
I just went to check.

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,120
I wanted to expose him after I found out his flaws.

79
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,440
Xuan Yi! Xuan Yi!

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,920
Xuan Yi!

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
These beans were cooked for two hours.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,880
It's a waste if we don't use them.

83
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,640
Sit.

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,960
What are you doing?

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,960
My father said that if a person has gray hair, he'll look down.

87
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,040
What did Gong Tongzi say?

88
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,560
He said that I've been very fierce lately.

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,960
But if I use his magic treasure,

90
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,120
I can get rid of all the troubles and turn the situation around.

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,080
You gave him money?

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,040
A little bit.

93
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,640
I've already asked Chi Xue to go out and find out where that monster is.

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Since I've agreed, I won't break my promise.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,880
I have my own way of doing things.

96
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,520
Since you chose me, you must believe me.

97
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,960
I will believe you.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,840
Then wait patiently. Don't rush.

99
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,520
Don't look for anyone else.

100
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I understand.

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,940
Where did he go?

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I found it.

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
I've been laughing

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,880
The scenery is like a dream, the time is bright

107
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,880
There are people who are willing to be together

108
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
The rain is falling on the ground

109
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
It's good to be together

110
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,880
The wind is not changing, the tenderness is like a thousand seconds with me

111
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Why are there people everywhere?

112
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,880
I'm willing to hold your hand and follow the moon

113
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,880
The stars are moving

114
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Ten good people, three bad people

115
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm willing to meet you

116
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
I'll wipe it for you

117
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
The world is in the past

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I just hope to be with you

119
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,880
The old bond is buried in the moon

120
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Suddenly I see you by my side

121
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I'll do it myself

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Xuan Yi

123
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,880
What are you doing? Why are you hugging each other?

124
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,880
I'm dyeing Xuan Yi's hair

125
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Dyeing hair?

126
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Miss, Dr. Jiu is not angry anymore?

127
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Dr. Jiu is reliable

128
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
We'll listen to Dr. Jiu from now on

129
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,880
No more trouble for the good news

130
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll go to the bathroom

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
I'll go to the bathroom

132
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I'll go to the bathroom

133
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Mingzhao

134
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Do you think Xuan Yi is possible to be Man Ying?

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
What?

136
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
You don't remember Man Ying?

137
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
I remember

138
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Isn't that a dream you had?

139
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Yes, you all said I was sick

140
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
There is no such thing as a dream in this world

141
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,880
But now it's confirmed that there is a dream in this world

142
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Is it possible that what I said is true and Man Ying is also true?

143
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
It's true

144
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Even if that dream is true, Man Ying is also true

145
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,880
How do you know Dr. Jiu is Man Ying?

146
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Xuan Yi has such a big wound

147
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
It's on the left chest

148
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
And it's a puncture

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
It should be exactly the same as the wound of Man Ying

150
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Miss

151
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
You took off Dr. Jiu's clothes?

152
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
The point is not this

153
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Miss, you are a person who has a family

154
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
How can you take off a stranger's clothes?

155
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,880
How is it a stranger?

156
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
We are quite familiar with each other

157
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Then you can't take off other people's clothes

158
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I didn't mean to

159
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Miss, I know you don't like your son

160
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,880
But this is ordered by the old man

161
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Before you handle this matter

162
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Even if you like someone else

163
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
You can only like it in your heart

164
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
How can you do it?

165
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
How can you do it?

166
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Do you know what you are doing?

167
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Anyway, I will listen to the old man

168
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Who is Miss?

169
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
You are a little crazy

170
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Hurry up and take your things

171
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Go, don't dream

172
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Wake up

173
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Wake up

174
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Xian Yi

175
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
I found out the news of the ghost

176
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Tell me

177
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
A boy was beaten to death

178
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
The man who was beaten to death was beheaded by Master Geng

179
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
You know this, right?

180
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
I know

181
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
But there is a news that the man is not dead

182
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Not dead

183
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Yes

184
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Someone saw him leaving the city

185
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
And he was very sincere

186
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Now the government has sent someone to find him secretly

187
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
You say

188
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
How can this ordinary person come back to life?

189
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Maybe it's like pretending to be his father

190
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Is the ghost changed his life, right?

191
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Oh no, something happened to Miss

192
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
What's the matter? So panic

193
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,880
The empty child we saw yesterday is dead

194
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Dead?

195
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
I just bought a new pot

196
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
I saw his house hanging a fan

197
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I just asked and I knew

198
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
He fell down last night

199
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Just fell to death

200
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
How strange

201
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
He was beaten to death yesterday like a lover

202
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
The enterprise fell to death

203
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I dare to ask you why you are not flying

204
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Isn't it here?

205
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
What's wrong, Xueyi?

206
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
I'm busy

207
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I just have one thing to ask you

208
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
The man who was beaten to death on the street

209
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
He really came back to life

210
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
You heard it too

211
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
What?

212
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
He was beheaded a few days ago

213
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
But there are rumors that he is not dead

214
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
We didn't pay attention

215
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Only the ghost is the matter

216
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm looking for someone to investigate

217
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Nothing is going on

218
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Is there really a thing in the world that brings back to life?

219
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Not necessarily

220
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
It's possible that the man you were beating to death is not him

221
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
It's impossible

222
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
I did it myself

223
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Okay, you go back first

224
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,880
If there is any news about this, tell me in time

225
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
White house

226
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
People who appear in white houses will die

227
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
White house

228
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Banxia, you are so anxious

229
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Where are you going?

230
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
White house

231
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
You have a white house on your head

232
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Yuan Yi, did you find it?

233
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
No

234
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Banxia

235
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Is the crow god still here?

236
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Xuan Yi, am I really going to die?

237
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I want you three times

238
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
It's not easy

239
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Three times

240
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Stop it

241
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
You scared me to death

242
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
But I don't understand

243
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Why does someone die when the crow appears?

244
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
That day in the illusion of Chi Wang Chuan

245
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
He once died and the crow attacked us

246
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I thought it was just his magic

247
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,880
But I didn't expect this crow to be his half-life monster

248
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
That's not right

249
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
I am not enemies with that god of Chi Wang Chuan

250
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
He is always harming you

251
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Why is it on me?

252
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
White crow is just a spirit

253
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
It doesn't have the ability to harm people

254
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
What do you mean?

255
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
That is to say, death is cause and white crow is fruit

256
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
It's because your fate has arrived that it will appear

257
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,880
It's not because of its appearance that you will die

258
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
That's why the white crow appears

259
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
It's just that the jade man dies and will not kill people

260
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
That's right

261
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,880
That's not right

262
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Isn't this the same as the eyes of the monster?

263
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
This is a good thing

264
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
What?

265
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
That Chi Wang Chuan thinks she is beautiful

266
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Likes her and gave her the half-life monster

267
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Do you think seeing death is a kind of gift?

268
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
No

269
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
No

270
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
This is a curse

271
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Then why am I still alive?

272
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Don't worry too much

273
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
It's not like you will die immediately when you see the white crow

274
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
How long will it take?

275
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
It should be five or six days

276
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Five or six days?

277
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Then three or two days

278
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Three or two days?

279
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Then one or two days, okay?

280
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
One or two days?

281
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Stop yelling

282
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Xue Yi, have you thought of a way?

283
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I knew you had a way

284
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
You have been my brother for so many years

285
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Come on, kill him

286
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
The white crow is a spirit

287
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
I can't kill it

288
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
And it's just a prelude

289
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Killing it can't solve any problems

290
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
What should I do?

291
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
I'll think of a way

292
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
You go home first

293
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
No, I can't

294
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm dying here

295
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Wenjing, Wenjing

296
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm not going to say anything

297
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
If my method doesn't work

298
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
You only have one or two days of life

299
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Don't you have anything to tell your family?

300
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Chi-xuan

302
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Send Wenwu home

303
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Wenwu, let's go

304
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
No, I'm not going

305
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Go

306
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
What?

307
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Send me home

308
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
You go home too

309
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,880
You don't have to worry about the white crow

310
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
This thing is different from other drugs

311
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Won't hurt you

312
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
If you really see it

313
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Just pretend you didn't see it

314
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I'll be fine

315
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
it is good

316
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm going back first

317
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Don't sigh

318
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
It's no use sighing

319
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
I have to die

320
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Wife

321
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
You still know to go home

322
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Did you go to bet money again?

323
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
How much money did you lose this time?

324
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Wife, don't worry

325
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Listen to me explain

326
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I

327
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,880
I don't know what you're doing

328
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I don't know what you're doing

329
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm blind

330
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
I look at you, fat man

331
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
I

332
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Chi-xuan, help me explain

333
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I really didn't go to bet money

334
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Then why don't you go home?

335
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I don't know either

336
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Maybe he's going to die

337
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Why are you looking at me?

338
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Aren't you pretty talkative?

339
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Can you talk nonsense?

340
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Continue to make up

341
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Wife

342
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm going to die

343
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Don't worry

344
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Listen to me finish

345
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Row

346
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
You say

347
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
You keep talking

348
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Say it

349
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Actually, I told you before

350
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I lied to you before I lost

351
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
How close am I?

352
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Can I not understand the principle of losing and losing?

353
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
I just like the shadow

354
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Want to save some private money

355
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
That money

356
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I put it in the air-tightened brick

357
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Wife

358
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You are still young

359
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Wait for me to die

360
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Find a good family

361
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Fengjian

362
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Fengjian

363
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
We are fine

364
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
It's no big deal to lose a few money

365
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
But don't scare me

366
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I know I'm very timid

367
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Did something happen to you?

368
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
We will find Mr. Geng

369
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Let Mr. Geng make decisions for you

370
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
This matter

371
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Mr. Geng can't help

372
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
Is someone coming to seek revenge?

373
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
I can't explain it clearly

374
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Anyway this time

375
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
It's hard to escape

376
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Changle Sword

377
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Changle Sword is born by the cause and effect

378
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
It is also capable of cutting off the cause and effect

379
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
When the time comes

380
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Changle Sword will appear

381
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Just

382
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
The source is hard to find

383
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Can't force

384
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
I'm back

385
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Is the road safe?

386
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Safe

387
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
But it's not necessarily home

388
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
His wife said she would cut it into eight pieces

389
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I think she's pretty serious

390
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
You want to

391
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Take Changle Sword to save Wenjian

392
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Unfortunately, the cause and effect have not arrived

393
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
He still refuses to show up

394
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
I'm going to kill you

395
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm going to kill you

396
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880

I'm going to kill you

I'm going to kill you

406
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm going to kill you

407
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I'm going to kill you

408
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm going to kill you

409
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm going to kill you

410
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
I'm going to kill you

411
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm going to kill you

412
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm going to kill you

413
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
I'm going to kill you

414
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
I'm going to kill you

415
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
I'm going to kill you

416
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm going to kill you

417
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
I'm going to kill you

418
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I'm going to kill you

422
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm going to kill you

423
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm going to kill you

424
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I'm going to kill you

425
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880

426
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
I'm going to kill you

434
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm going to kill you

435
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm going to kill you

436
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,480
Stop!

437
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
Are you going to immilate...

438
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,080
or rob...

439
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,240
I am going to immilate.

440
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
You are alone?

441
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Yes

442
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
What is your name?

443
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
My name is Duan

444
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Duan

445
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Where are you from?

446
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
I am from the city of the dragon

447
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
I am from the city of the dragon

448
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Where are you from?

449
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
From the city of the dragon

450
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Where are you from?

451
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
I am from the city of the dragon

452
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Where are you from?

453
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
Where are you going?

454
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
If you don't go out, you will be in the way

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
If the government asks

456
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I can't answer

457
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I was careless

458
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Excuse me, where is the shopkeeper here?

459
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
The shopkeeper is my father

460
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
In the backyard

461
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
You are from the palace?

462
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Can you give me a room first?

463
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,880
The hot spring in our inn is the most famous

464
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I will take you to make soup later

465
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I will take you to make soup later

466
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
No need, just prepare some leeks

467
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Okay

468
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Your inn is really quiet

469
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Your inn is really quiet

470
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
My father wants to renovate the inn

471
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
My father wants to renovate the inn

472
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
So recently

473
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
No more guests

474
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Only one guest?

475
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Yes

476
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I can't put you outside

477
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
It's a wild place

478
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
It's a wild place

479
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
It's not safe to go outside alone

480
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
It's not safe to go outside alone

481
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Your inn is so complicated

482
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Your inn is so complicated

483
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Aren't you afraid of getting lost?

484
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
There are many friends here

485
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
There are many friends here

486
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
No matter where you are

487
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
As long as you change your voice

488
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Everyone can hear

489
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Naturally

490
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
No fear of getting lost

491
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Mother

492
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
You go to

493
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
This young man

494
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Prepare some leeks

495
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Send to the front yard

496
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Yes

497
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
What are you doing?

498
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
I

499
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
I think the young man's

500
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Look is not good

501
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
It's better to stay here

502
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Stay here for a few days

503
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
I'll be back

504
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
I have something to do

505
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
Stay here for a night

506
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Just one night?

507
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
My father said

508
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Meeting is fate

509
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
What a pity

510
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Young master

511
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
The room is in front

512
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
This is our

513
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880

514
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Light and sweet

515
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Very delicious

516

00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm sorry.

573
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm sorry.

579
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'm sorry.

582
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm sorry.

584
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm sorry.

600
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm sorry.

601
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
I'm sorry.

603
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm sorry.

604
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
I'm sorry.

607
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I'm sorry.

608
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm sorry.

610
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
I'm sorry.

611
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Give me the toothbrush.

614
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Give me the toothbrush.

615
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Give me the toothbrush.

616
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
It's made of wood.

617
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
What kind of bow did they find you?

618
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Ice bow.

619
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Come on, come on, come on, next round, next round.

620
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Don't run.

621
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Hold it.

622
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
It's okay, it's okay, don't run

623
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Let's go, let's go

624
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Sister

625
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Don't move

626
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Where is Gao Sheng?

627
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
He... he died

628
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Died?

629
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
Yes, he died

630
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I heard that two days ago you drank with someone

631
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
You said that Gao Sheng came back from his death and even drank with you

632
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Why did he die now?

633
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Nonsense

634
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
Really?

635
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
You... you...

636
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Say it or not?

637
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,880
I will say it, I will say it

638
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
I thought he was dead

639
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
He was so scared when he saw me

640
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
He told me

641
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
that his mother used some tricks to make him escape

642
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Where is he?

643
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
He is in the mountains, he is hiding from the wind

644
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
I will go

645
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
You are here

646
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
You didn't sleep all night?

647
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Did you find any way?

648
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Let's go to Wen Jian's house first

649
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Wait for me

650
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
He is sitting on the mountain and sending a funeral message

651
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Let's go

652
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Okay

653
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Wen Jian, wake up

654
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Where is he?

655
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Go

656
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Go

657
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Go

658
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Slowly

659
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Higher

660
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Higher

661
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Yes, to the left

662
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Left, left

663
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Don't watch the crowd here

664
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Go

665
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Isn't that the police?

666
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Go

667
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Someone is hitting him

668
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,880
What happened?

669
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Who is that?

670
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
What happened?

671
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Who is that?

672
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
What happened?

673
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Why did you hit him so hard?

674
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
What happened?

675
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Wen Jian

676
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
There were some guards outside the door

677
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
They said that the officer of the police office

678
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
will be here soon

679
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
And the officers of the Suji Cemetery

680
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
will be here soon

681
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Do you think they will come here later?

682
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Why?

683
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Why?

684
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Why?

685
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Sister-in-law

686
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Sister-in-law

687
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Dr. Jiu

688
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
My wife is in a bad mood

689
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
You and Wen Jian have always been close

690
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Otherwise

691
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
You should have a better idea

692
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
I know

693
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
What?

694
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Why are you so noisy?

695
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Wen Jian

696
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Wen Jian

697
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
You are dead

698
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
You are dead

699
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
What's wrong?

700
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
My wife

701
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
You are dressed like this

702
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
I knew you would not die

703
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
My wife

704
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
My wife

705
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
My wife

706
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
My wife

707
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
My wife

708
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Today on the street

709
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,880
We saw a man who looked exactly like you

710
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
He was killed by a bat

711
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
We all thought it was you

712
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
So we held a funeral for you

713
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Exactly the same as me?

714
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
What's wrong with you?

715
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Where have you been?

716
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I have been sleeping

717
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I woke up

718
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
I was under the bed

719
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I heard you guys fighting outside

720
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Wenxia

721
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Is the crow still there?

722
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
No

723
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
He was killed by a bat on the street

724
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
He has already flown away

725
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Such a good thing?

726
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
A man who looks exactly like me

727
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
He died

728
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
And I am fine

729
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Do you know the black cat on the street?

730
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
How could I know a cat?

731
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
San

732
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,880
Do you know it?

733
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
My wife

734
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
This is very likely to be a trap

735
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
I have been looking for it for a long time

736
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Wenxia has escaped

737
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
But we don't know

738
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
If it is a trap

739
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
I hope you can tell us the truth

740
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
We can make a plan

741
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
That day

742
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Wenxia came back

743
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
She said she was dead

744
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
She told me

745
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Where she hid her private room

746
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
I was afraid of her and couldn't sleep

747
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
I went to her room

748
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Suddenly I heard a cat

749
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
I turned around

750
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
I saw a cat on the wall

751
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
Is it the cat on the street?

752
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
It's too dark

753
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I can't see clearly

754
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
But the cat gives a feeling

755
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
It's unusual

756
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
I thought of it

757
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Rumor about cat demon

758
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
And the words Wenxia said

759
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,880
I was very nervous

760
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
I was very satisfied

761
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
I gave all the money to the cat

762
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
I want to help Wenxia

763
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
I didn't expect it to work

764
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
My wife

765
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,880
Cat demon

766
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Yes

767
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
It's called the immortal

768
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
I heard that if you give it money

769
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,880
It can change your life

770
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,880
Change the life demon

771
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,880
It's the life demon

772
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,880
Sister-in-law

773
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Do you know

774
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
How to change the life demon?

775
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I asked

776
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Said to go out alone at midnight

777
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Then turn left at the first intersection

778
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,880
Stop at the seventh intersection

779
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Then

780
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
Don't turn back on the way

781
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
Why hasn't Banxia come for so long?

782
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
Is there any accident?

783
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,880
I'm Banxia

784
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
I'm here to pray

785
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,880
Please come to see me

786
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm Banxia

787
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm here to pray

788
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
Immortal of Nine Lives

789
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
My name is Duan Banxia

790
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
My father's name is Duan Yinghang

791
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I have something

792
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,880
I want to ask the immortal of nine lives

793
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
A month ago

794
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,880
Penglai, Nanyang

795
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
To the third house of the left

796
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,880
Caused a fire

797
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,880
Did my father lend you a life?

798
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,880
In the fire

799
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,880
Faked death

800
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Also escaped from the demon

801
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Immortal of Nine Lives

802
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,880
Banxia

803
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Xuanye

804
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
I just saw the immortal of nine lives

805
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
The first time I saw you

806
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
I was so happy

807
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880

If you are not here

862
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,880
How can you leave your heart

863
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,880
and light up the world

864
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Light up the world

865
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,880
Deep in the stars

866
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,880
The light of the past

867
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,880
is shining in front of your smile

868
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
You are not here

869
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,880
How many loves and ifs

870
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,880
can you forget?

871
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,880
I carry everything

872
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
as if I was in a dream

873
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,880
Reuniting in the eternal world

874
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Reuniting in the eternal world

875
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,880
