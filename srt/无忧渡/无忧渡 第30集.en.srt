Since we are done, let's go

Let's wait a little longer.

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,270
I'm waiting for someone.

8
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,770
Physician Jiu,  looking for me?

9
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,120
Could you please

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,850
deliver this

11
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,640
to Lord Guan's residence at Huaijiang Alley

in Shendu City?

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,420
Shendu City, Huaijiang Alley, Lord Guan.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,090
Got it. Rest assured.

15
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,020
I'll get it done.

16
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,670
Thank you.

17
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,390
Who is Lord Guan?

18
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,610
When I was in Shendu City on business years ago,

19
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,980
I happened to run into Lord Guan

20
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,280
being harassed by a demon.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,329
I helped him out,

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,560
so we got acquainted.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,100
So this time, you're writing to him to...

24
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,710
To expose Xingxian.

25
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,880
The one who brought Xingxian into the capital this time

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,750
is the Vice Minister of Rites,

27
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,120
a subordinate of Qin Xuanzhi.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,370
And this Lord Guan

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,000
has a very good relationship with Qin Xuanzhi.

30
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,380
Why are you exposing Xingxian?

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,880
Shouldn't I?

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,500
No... I just feel that...

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You think that because I'm a demon hunter,

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,860
I might be biased towards humans?

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,310
Everyone

36
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,860
must face the consequences

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,870
of their actions.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,590
We can't let good people suffer bad outcomes,

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,030
nor can we let evil people reap good rewards.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,310
Demons must not hurt humans,

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,150
but humans should also not bully demons.

42
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,080
To achieve peaceful coexistence,

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
it must not be a one-sided expectation.

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,510
You're right.

Have you resolved that trouble that was

49
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,450
bothering you?

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,990
What trouble?

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
It was when you suddenly

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
seemed like a different person,

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,280
and then you told me to tell you

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,750
that you would definitely come back to find yourself.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,170
That has been resolved.

was it another demon?

58

Don't worry about it.

59
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,240
I wasn't worried at all.

Where... where is he going?

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
He thinks I haven't been treating him well lately,

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,410
so he's running away from home.

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,610
Isn't that just causing trouble?

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,810
And you agreed to it?

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,589
That's just how he is.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,870
Sometimes when he's in the mood,

75
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,670
he'll go out and play for a while.

76
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,950
But isn't it dangerous for him to be running around

77
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,070
all by himself?

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
He's a demon,

79
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,560
not a child.

80
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,510
Yes,

81

but what if he accidentally

82
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,800
encounters other demon hunters?

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
Last time, that demon hunter surnamed Jiang

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,659
almost caught him, didn't he?

85

You don't want him to leave?

While we at the Eight Pillar Sect,

Chi Xue was raised by my father since he was young.

We all treat him as family.

92

So whether he stays or leaves,

we are all respectful of his choice.

he is a demon.

96

He will leave me sooner or later.

stay together?

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
You said it yourself

that we can coexist peacefully.

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,950

can't good friends like you and Chi Xue

continue to stay together?

105

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,750
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,680
Have you heard of

178
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,140
the Carefree Land?

179
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,480
It is a wondrous and ethereal land

180
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
beyond the mortal realm.

181
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,240
I don't want to stay here

182
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,560
listening to your stories.

183
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
I'm not interested in telling stories either.

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,220
But as a demon hunter,

185
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,840
aren't you curious about where all the demons in the world

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,720
come from?

187
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,730
Carefree Land

188
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,950
is the mystical origin

189
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,360
of the primordial spirit

190
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
of countless demons.

191
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,460
Every 12 years,

192
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,550
the Carefree Grass releases the primordial spirit within the realm.

193
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,720
At that time, the secret realm opens,

194
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,270
connecting the human and demon worlds,

195
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,720
so that the primordial spirit can be dispersed

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,780
and live on its own.

197
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,600
Be it birds, beasts,

198
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,250
or even ancient artifacts,

199
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,010
once it catches hold of the primordial spirit,

200
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,630
its consciousness will be awakened

201
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,890
and it becomes a demon.

202
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,550
This is the origins of

203
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,890
the demon clan.

204
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,330
Such a secret realm

205
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,870
cannot be left unguarded.

206
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,030
That’s why the strongest of the demon clan,

207
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,240
the Mystic Panther Clan, has been safeguarding it for generations.

208
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,840
And the Supreme Master of the Mystic Panther Clan

209
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,720
is my father,

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,000
Yue Yan.

211
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,150
And you

212
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,580
are also my father's son,

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
my half-brother.

214
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,590
Your name is Man Ying.

215
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,580
You're saying I'm a demon?

216
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,470
That's right.

217
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,510
Twelve years ago,

218
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,360
to save a little girl,

219
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,670
you violated the rules of our clan

220
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,070
and have since been lost in the human world.

221
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,150
Now, as the Carefree Land

222
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,410
is about to open again,

223
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,000
I've come to the human world to look for you in advance.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,060
I am precisely here to bring you back.

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,790
Actually, before I came,

226
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,390
I thought about many things.

227
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
I thought about how you might refuse

228
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,180
or be unwilling to return.

229
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,870
I even thought about how you might have

230
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,730
your own valid reasons and logic.

231
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,670
But I never imagined

232
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,870
it would be like this.

233
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,720
You've actually lost your memory.

234
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,510
You had even forgotten about your supreme mission

235
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,510
and responsibilities completely.

236
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,120
How ridiculous.

237
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,200
Listen to me carefully.

238
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,270
I

239
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,890
was born in Guangping.

240
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
I have my own parents.

241
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
I am a demon hunter from the Ganshan Clinic

242
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,830
and the successor of the Eight Pillar Sect.

243
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,490
I am not some

244
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,600
panther demon you've been talking about.

245
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
As a member of the demon clan,

246
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,500
not only did you become a demon hunter,

247
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,200
but you had even accepted incompetent mortals

248
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,130
as your parents.

249
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,410
Well, well.

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,460
How wonderful.

251
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,270
Should I praise you for that?

252
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,240
I won't allow you

253
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,590
to insult my parents.

254
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,750
Parents?

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,130
It seems nothing I say will make a difference.

256
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,730
You won't believe me anyway.

257
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
I won't fight you.

258
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,090
The way you are now,

259
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
even if I forcibly take you back,

260
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,870
it would be meaningless.

261
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,600
But you can't fool

262
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,060
yourself for much longer.

263
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,960
You should be able to feel it.

264
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,800
And I'm also curious about something.

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,330
If your family and friends

266
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
knew you were a demon,

267
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
how would they react?

268
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,990
Would they still

269
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,670
accept you

270
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,960
and trust you as before?

271
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,360
I recently learned a saying

272
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,460
in the human world

273
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,550
that makes a lot of sense.

274
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,320
"Those who are not of our kind

275
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,000
cannot be trusted."

276
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,080
Cherish your time as a human.

277
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,460
I'll come back for you.

278
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,030
Banxia?

279
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,070
What brings you here?

280
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,470
Xuanye has disappeared.

281
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,590
What do you mean by disappeared?

282
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,440
We had agreed to go

283
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,100
to the market together today.

284
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
But I just went to Ganshan Clinic,

285
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,370
and he wasn't there.

286
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,840
How is that considered disappearing?

287
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,240
Hey may

288
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,340
just have gone out.

289
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Taverns, teahouses,

290
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,750
the theaters and dance troupes.

291
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,550
Have you searched these places?

292
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,080
No,

293
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,600
it's mainly because Chi Xue said

294
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,510
a demon beast had entered

295
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,040
Ganshan Clinic yesterday.

296
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,430
A demon beast?

297
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,790
What kind of demon beast?

298
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,050
Why are you here again?

299
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,870
I'm here to see Lord Geng.

300
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,730
Do I need to notify you in advance?

301
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,570
Go on,

302
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,660
what kind of demon beast?

303
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,190
Chi Xue didn't give details.

304
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,510
He just said... it was a beast,

305
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,760
and that it was very strong.

306
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,950
How is Chi Xue now?

307
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,320
He's fine.

308
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,200
It seems that demon beast

309
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,930
only knocked him unconscious.

310
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,590
So you're saying

311
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,960
Chi Xue didn't see Xuanye

312
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,400
fight that demon beast?

313
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,470
No, he didn't.

314
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,940
Then you must be overthinking it.

315
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,310
Xuanye is someone who can come and go

316
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,120
as he pleases at the Underground City.

317
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,780
He shouldn't be in any danger.

318
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:27,960
He must have

319
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,560
gone after that demon beast.

320
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,860
There's no harm waiting a little longer.

321
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,600
How about...

322
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,610
You go home and wait first?

323
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,080
Alright.

324
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,190
I'll be going then.

325
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,480
If there's any news,

326
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I'll let you know.

327
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,870
Don't worry too much.

328
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,160
Xuanye!

329
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,589
Where did you go?

330
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,550
I've been looking for you for ages.

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,599
I didn't go anywhere.

332
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,829
Chi Xue said a demon beast got into the house.

333
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,890
Did you go after it?

334
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,079
Demon beast?

335
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,680
Yes.

336
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,960
He said that demon beast was very powerful.

337
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
It knocked him out in one hit.

338
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
You weren't home last night?

339
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,720
Let me go ask Chi Xue first.

340
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,250
-I’ll go with you.
-No need.

341
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,850
You go home first.

342
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,510
I'll go ask him first.

343
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,900
Xuanye!

344
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,680
You're back.

345
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,500
Chi Xue.

346
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,610
Banxia said last night,

347
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,890
a demon beast came into our house.

348
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,370
Is that true?

349
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,480
What kind of demon beast was it?

350
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,390
It...

351
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,570
was very fast

352
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,930
and very strong.

353
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,960
Before I could react,

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,270
I was already knocked out.

355
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,870
I didn't get a good look at it.

356
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,510
You didn't see it?

357
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,560
I thought you went after it.

358
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,720
Xuanye.

359
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,310
I won't leave just yet.

360
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,460
That demon beast is not easy to deal with.

361
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,660
I'll stay to help you.

362
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,470
Okay.

363
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Have you ever thought

364
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,070
what it would be like

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,350
if you weren't a demon hunter

366
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,640
but a demon instead?

367
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,920
These are Moon Bugs.

368
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,350
They feed on primordial spirit and moonlight.

369
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,550
Some clever deception

370
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,170
can fool people,

371
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,170
but they can't fool Moon Bugs.

372
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,080
That's why

373
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,770
they have another name.

374
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,790
They are also known as the eyes of demon hunters.

375
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,410
So are there any other ways

376
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,240
one can deceive these Moon Bugs?

377
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,250
Very few.

378
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,800
These... these are all cut out?

379
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,400
Such skillful hands!

380
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,190
Of course, it can't be chewed out, right?

381
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,880
You should learn from them, Commissioner.

382
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,030
Those are real girls' hands.

383
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,690
Unlike you,

384
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,830
who only knows how to fight and kill.

385
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,480
Banxia,

386
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,300
what are you cutting?

387
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,280
Let me see.

388
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,240
It's obvious.

389
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,190
It's me.

390
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,010
This...

391
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,970
This is clearly a cat, isn't it?

392
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,500
Did... did you cut out a cat?

393
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,180
That looks like a tiger to me.

394
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,160
I think...

395
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,290
that looks like a panther.

396
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,610
Oh, right.

397
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,720
Where's Xuanye?

398
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,690
He went out.

399
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,210
Where did he go?

400
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,750
I don't know.

401
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,350
I haven't seen him since early this morning.

402
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,750
On such an important day,

403
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,590
why did Xuanye go out at a time like this?

404
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,270
Exactly.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,530
You've got such a big mouth.

406
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,310
So much nonsense.

407
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,350
Nothing to do at the government office,

408
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,680
so you're gossiping here?

409
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,210
I'm just making small talk.

410
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,140
Xuanye.

411
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,970
Where have you been?

412
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,090
I went out to take care of something.

413
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,070
Xuanye.

414
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,630
Were you out to catch a demon?

415
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,490
Was it the one Chi Xue mentioned

416
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,550
that broke into your house

417
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,410
two nights ago?

418
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,240
Yes.

419
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,000
Any leads?

420
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,480
Not yet.

421
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,370
Don't worry.

422
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,680
Lord Geng is already aware of this matter.

423
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,160
I've also notified the hunters outside the city.

424
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,830
Once they spot any trace of that demon beast,

425
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,760
they'll report to it immediately.

426
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
That's a demon.

427
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,000
What's the use of finding hunters?

428
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,570
So what if it's a demon?

429
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,590
It can't even transform into human form.

430
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,540
That means it's not as powerful as Chi Xue.

431
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,860
Why can't hunters handle it?

432
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,980
It's not as powerful as Chi Xue?

433
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,830
It knocked Chi Xue out in one hit.

434
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,880
That only proves it has brute strength.

435
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,110
You have brute strength too, don't you?

436
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,970
Can you beat me?

437
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,700
Right, Xuanye?

438
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,920
Xuanye.

439
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,130
Did you really go to catch that demon?

440
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,950
Yes, I did.

441
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,660
Chi Xue said that demon is very powerful.

442
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,120
Do you want to

443
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,160
ask for more help?

444
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,000
It's fine.

445
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,920
No need.

446
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,510
Xuanye.

447
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,180
Tomorrow, the two of us

448
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,510
are going to be engaged.

449
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,260
You'll be a man with a family from then on.

450
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,480
So no matter what you do,

451
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,870
you can't be as reckless

452
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,680
as you were before.

453
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,510
Do you hear me?

454
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,070
I understand.

455
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,110
You look so tired.

456
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,570
Why don't you lie down and rest for a while?

457
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,950
Alright.

458
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,030
The Supreme Master of the Mystic Panther Clan

459
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,960
is my father,

460
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,110
Yue Yan.

461
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,270
And you

462
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,110
are also my father's son,

463
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,830
my half-brother,

464
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,890
named Man Ying.

465
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,210
You're saying I'm a demon?

466
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,390
That's right.

467
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,270
Xuanye!

468
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,720
Xuanye!

469
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,600
Xuanye!

470
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,750
Xuanye, are you okay?

471
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,240
Xuanye!

472
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,660
Xuanye!

473
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,310
Xuanye!

474
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,400
Xuanye!

475
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,250
Have you seen Xuan...

476
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,390
P-Panther...

477
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,670
It's a panther!

478
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,560
Panther! It's a panther!

479
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,020
Have you heard?

480
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,070
There was another demon sighting last night.

481
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,590
Really?

482
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,270
Someone saw it with their own eyes.

483
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,000
They said it was a black panther demon.

484
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,130
There really are demons in this world.

485
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,120
Of course there are.

486
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
My brother-in-law is a clerk at the government office.

487
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,720
I heard from him

488
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,250
that Lord Geng has started capturing demons.

489
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,460
My Lady.

490
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,790
We are just paying taxes today.

491
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,170
You don't even need to be personally there.

492
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,970
Why are you dolling yourself up?

493
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
Why else do you think I'm getting all

494
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,300
dressed up?

495
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,060
Physician Jiu is coming?

496
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,700
We received the letter

497
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,120
and rushed to Guangping.

498
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I didn’t expect to

499
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,220
run into yet another happy occasion.

500
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,950
Yingheng,

501
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,960
this is what they call surviving a great ordeal and

502
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,420
being blessed with good fortune afterward.

503
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,310
Father couldn't believe it at first.

504
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,250
He kept confirming on the way here

505
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,400
if it was really your handwritten letter, Uncle Yingheng.

506
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,130
This matter,

507
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,950
indeed, is too bizarre.

508
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,400
If we hadn't experienced it ourselves,

509
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,360
no matter who said it,

510
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,820
we wouldn't have dared to believe it easily.

511
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,310
You know,

512
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,480
that girl Banxia,

513
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,200
who usually looks so delicate and fragile,

514
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,060
I never thought

515
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,430
she would be so brave.

516
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
That's all thanks to Physician Jiu.

517
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,510
Otherwise, with her abilities alone,

518
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,510
how could she have fought against a demon?

519
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,790
Still calling him Physician Jiu?

520
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,650
He's already our son-in-law now.

521
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,200
Yanqiu.

522
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,360
Uncle Yingheng.

523
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,750
I heard from Banxia

524
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,490
that you're also acquainted with Xuanye.

525
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,790
Yes,

526
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,440
he saved me previously.

527
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,770
He's a reliable person.

528
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,310
Banxia's making the right choice

529
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,240
by marrying him.

530
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,240
Tingzhou.

531
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,510
Is it time yet?

532
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,380
It should be time already.

533
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,070
I'll go check.

534
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,310
Don't worry.

535
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,750
In his household,

536
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,880
there are no elders,

537
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,860
so it's understandable if things are a bit chaotic.

538
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:00,960
Yes.

539
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,430
Uncle.

540
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Banxia, why are you here?

541
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,280
Hasn't Xuanye arrived yet?

542
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,230
Yanqiu has already gone to look for him.

543
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,950
I'll go too.

544
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,480
Banxia.

545
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,510
Banxia!

546
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,200
-Xuanye!
-Xuanye!

547
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,830
Chi Xue!

548
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Xuanye!

549
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,610
Open the door!

550
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,940
What time is it already?

551
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,310
Yanqiu.

552
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,810
Banxia.

553
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,750
When did you get here?

554
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,880
We just got here too.

555
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,380
There was a demon causing trouble around here yesterday.

556
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,440
What kind of demon?

557
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,500
They say it was a black panther demon.

558
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,530
Kick the door open.

559
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,550
-Xuanye!
-Xuanye!

560
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,070
Xuanye!

561
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,830
-Xuanye!
-Xuanye!

562
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,860
Let's split up.

563
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,800
Search every corner.

564
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,330
Alright.

565
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,350
Xuanye!

566
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
Did you find him?

567
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,110
No.

568
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,880
My Lady.

569
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,400
The back door is open.

570
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,070
Then let's go outside.

571
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,530
Let's split up and search.

572
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,530
Scented sachets, pouches and little trinkets for sale!

573
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,350
Chief Constable Chu.

574
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,640
Have you found Xuanye?

575
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,450
Xuanye might be in trouble.

576
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,330
I've confirmed it.

577
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,440
Last night, a few more people

578
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,640
saw that demon beast.

579
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,310
He and Chi Xue

580
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,840
might have gone to catch it.

581
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
What kind of demon beast?

582
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,030
They say it's

583
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,010
a black panther demon.

584
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,270
My Lady.

585
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,170
Banxia.

586
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,480
What's wrong?

587
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,880
Banxia.

588
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,860
Do you know something?

589
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,210
Have you seen that demon beast?

590
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,310
Banxia.

591
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,510
Banxia.

592
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,650
Don't worry.

593
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,320
Xuanye is a capable person.

594
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,830
Even if that demon beast is powerful,

595
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,170
it surely can't do anything to him.

596
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,960
Chief Constable Wen and your brother

597
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,070
have already left the city.

598
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,800
We'll continue searching too.

599
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,280
Why don't

600
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,130
you go home first

601
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,400
and wait for our news?

602
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,060
My Lady.

603
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,280
Tingzhou.

604
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,320
My Lady.

605
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
My Lady, let's go.

606
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,520
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

607
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,810
What's strange?

608
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,960
When I was in Shendu previously,

609
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,160
I encountered a demon

610
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,120
that was related to Xuanye.

611
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,370
Why haven't I heard you mention this before?

612
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,530
Would you have listened if I had told you?

613
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,220
Why are you bleeding?

614
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,880
How... how did this happen?

615
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,410
Xuanye might be in trouble.

616
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,220
I've confirmed it.

617
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,350
Several people last night

618
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,720
saw that demon beast again.

619
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,750
He and Chi Xue might have gone to catch the demon.

620
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,750
What demon beast?

621
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,790
They say it's

622
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,980
a black panther demon.

623
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,640
Who is it?

624
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,940
My Lady.

625
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,050
Tingzhou, who did you see?

626
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,070
I just saw a figure

627
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,550
standing over there.

628
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,960
Xuanye?

629
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,230
It must be Xuanye.

630
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,280
Xuanye!

631
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,710
Xuanye!

632
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,340
Xuanye, come out!

633
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,219
Xuanye!

634
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,010
Banxia!

635
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,790
Banxia!

636
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,949
What's wrong?

637
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,889
Mother,

638
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,219
Tingzhou saw Xuanye.

639
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,920
I'm not certain either.

640
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
I just saw...

641
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,580
a figure standing over there.

642
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,460
-Banxia!
-My Lady!

643
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,360
Xuanye!

644
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,710
Xuanye!

645
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,020
Xuanye!

646
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,110
Xuanye!

647
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,590
Xuanye!

648
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,440
Xuanye, stop joking around!

649
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,370
Come out now!

650
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,150
Come out right now!

651
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,170
I'm really going to get angry!

652
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,330
I will really get angry.

653
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,530
♫Melody echoes along the river; wild geese soar in sudden fright♫

654
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,700
♫The music ends, and I stand in solitude♫

655
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,570
♫I see you turn into a handful of starlight♫

♫I know it also brought you great pain to let go♫

660
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,030
I'm sorry.

661
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,780
♫But why did you♫

♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

668

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,260
a long, long time ago,

670
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,210
♫I hate that I failed♫

♫To catch the glistening starlight♫

673

how to tell you.

675
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,510
I was afraid you'd push me away.

676

♫We were meant to miss each other in this life♫

00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,400
Xuanye.

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,330
Xuanye, I...

680
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:52,970
♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

681

I hate myself

682
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,710
for not telling you earlier.

683
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,550
I really don't care.

684
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
I really...

685
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,960
I really don't care!

686
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,030
You...

687
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,200
I was wrong.

688
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,230
Can you come back?

689
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,410
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,070
It's all my fault.

691
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,920
I'm... I'm sorry.

692
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm sorry.

693
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,650
My Lady!

694
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,340
Master!

695
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,030
I think I hear

696
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,030
Ms. Duan's voice.

697
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,030
Master, look!

698
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,290
Banxia!

699
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,800
My Lady!

700
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,230
I was wrong.

701
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,170
♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

702
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,230
Banxia!

703
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,220
My Lady!

704
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,050
Banxia.

705
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,270
♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

706
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,280
Come with me.

707
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,480
♫I hate that I failed♫

708
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,710
Come home with me.

709
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:01,880
♫To catch the glistening starlight♫

710
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,080
Master, slowly.

711
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,660
♫We were meant to miss each other in this life♫

712
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,400
♫Only after missing did we learn how much love could hurt♫

713
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,980
♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

714
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,190
Banxia.

715
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,640
Have a bowl of ginger tea to keep the cold away.

716
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,680
A letter from Xuanye.

717
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,090
Do you want to read it?

718
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,600
He says

719
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,140
your marriage has been annulled.

720
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,160
But he didn't give a reason.

721
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,230
Banxia,

722
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,410
do you know why?

723
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,380
It's fine if you don't want to say.

724
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,680
Although he's being fickle about this,

725
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,190
after all,

726
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,360
he's our family's benefactor.

727
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
I don't want to

728
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,030
put too much blame on him either.

729
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,560
I never wanted

730
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,520
you to marry him.

731
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,680
He's a demon hunter,

732
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,510
dealing with demons every day.

733
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,710
It's very dangerous.

734
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,290
You're my only daughter.

735
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,480
Our family was separated for 11 years.

736
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,840
I don't want to see

737
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,100
you in danger again.

738
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,510
But all of you convinced me otherwise.

739
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,500
I just didn't expect...

740
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,790
Your mother's health

741
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,140
has almost recovered.

742
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:38,970
Banxia.

743
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,400
Let's go back to Nanyang

744
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,910
with Uncle together.

745
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,220
Don't you miss your Grandmother?

746
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,400
When she learned that

747
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,070
your mother and I were still alive,

748
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,610
she was so happy that she couldn't sleep

749
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,740
for several nights.

750
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,170
She's getting old.

751
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,160
We should go back to see her.

752
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,740
Some things...

753
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,440
if you can't figure them out right away,

754
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,770
just let them be for now.

755
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,620
When the time is right,

756
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,440
maybe a change will come.

757
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,770
He doesn't want to see you now.

758
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,870
There's no point in you

759
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,220
staying here anymore.

760
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,510
Banxia.

761
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,320
Later,

762
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,960
drink the ginger soup.

763
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,400
Xuanye!

764
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,500
I've finally found you.

765
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,030
Chi Xue.

766
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Go away!

767
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,240
I won't leave.

768
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,880
How did you turn into a demon?

769
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,340
Xuanye!

770
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,110
Go!

771
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,530
I can't control

772
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,210
myself now.

773
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,480
Go away!

774
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,440
Xuanye!

775
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,440
Xuanye!

776
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,590
You were originally from the Mystic Panther Clan.
