I'm going to kill him!

Brother, I'm going to kill him!

14
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Old Fang, I'm going to kill him!

15
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,140
I'm going to kill him!

16
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
I'm going to kill him!

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
Hurry up!

18
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
Take him! Take him to the dead!

19
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,140
Let me go!

20
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
Get up!

21
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,140
Beat him up!

22
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,140
I'll beat him up!

23
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,140
Who sent you here?

24
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,140
Why did you kill me?

25
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,140
I won't tell you!

26
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,140
Come here!

27
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Beat him up!

28
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,140
Are these bad women gold?

29
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,140
Scumbag!

30
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,660
Run!

31
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,080
Kill all of them!

32
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Kill all of them!

33
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,220
Kill all of them.

34
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,360
Kill all of them

35
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,300
and kill all of them

36
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,460
The сотруд сталоன

37
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,980
Impressive!

38
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,100
You...

39
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,900
Stop!

40
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,380
Hurry up, go home.

41
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,340
Go home.

42
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,340
You...

43
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,700
You are very familiar.

44
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,300
How dare you ask me?

45
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
We are from the Dali Temple.

46
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,700
We are from the Huo State.

47
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,540
We are the people of Fengzhi.

48
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,380
Even if we are from the Huo State,

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,060
why don't we ask them?

50
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,900
How can we kill them?

51
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,460
Your Majesty,

52
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,780
we kill whoever we want.

53
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,300
Do you have any instructions?

54
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,300
We are from the Guangping Manor.

55
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,220
This is the local area of Guangping.

56
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,980
How can we let you kill people?

57
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,780
Guangping Manor?

58
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,620
The people of the Huo State are going to kill us.

59
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,500
I think you are the one who killed the people.

60
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,660
You...

61
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,140
You...

62
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,260
aphase of danger.

63
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,860
Bring me thisüp harmony.

64
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,100
Yes.

65
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,980
Yes.

66
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:22,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
Which means

69
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
You should runt

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,560
The whisper

71
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,760
Van

72
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,280
Why are you here?

73
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,680
I'd like to 녀

74
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Do we know each other?

75
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Yes, we know each other.

76
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,520
We saw the moon together on the hill in Nanyang.

77
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Have you seen this person?

78
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
No.

79
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Have you seen this person?

80
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Who is this person?

81
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,520
I want to see when your voice is heard.

82
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Is it a bad voice?

83
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Coming.

84
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Excuse me, is there anything?

85
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
No, it's useless.

86
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
The shop is closed.

87
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
You can go to the other side.

88
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
I'll go to the other side.

89
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Where is the yellow one?

90
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Who?

91
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
How did I wake up for you? What did you do?

92
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
I can't say this now.

93
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
We don't have much time.

94
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Where are you going now?

95
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
They are awake.

96
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Hurry up.

97
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
I'll block them.

98
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Be careful.

99
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
I'll go to you after I finish.

100
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I'm going home.

101
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Do you want to go to the hospital?

102
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
No, I'm going to the hospital.

103
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Hurry up.

104
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Brother, you're back.

105
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
You're smarter than I thought.

106
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
You're really...

107
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Brother,

108
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I'm so sorry.

109
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm really...

110
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Brother,

111
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
how could I have a brother like you?

112
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Why?

113
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Brother,

114
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,520
you're so kind and kind.

115
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
How interesting.

116
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
When did you see me?

117
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Very early.

118
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
I didn't expect you to be more capable than me.

119
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Did I show my foot?

120
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
The owner of this place

121
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
created such a world with no meaning.

122
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
How could he just look outside?

123
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Makes sense.

124
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
When I was a kid, my father told me

125
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
that there are many powerful demons

126
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
in this world

127
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
that can create a real illusion.

128
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I didn't believe it.

129
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I always thought he was lying to me.

130
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
But I didn't expect it to be true.

131
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
It's just a pity.

132
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
It's a pity that your half-dead demon

133
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
is too weak.

134
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
He's not even my opponent

135
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
who can control the whole universe.

136
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
If I wasn't attracted to him,

137
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I could have taken his life

138
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
on the day I was in Shuzhai.

139
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
How could a demon

140
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
be the owner of this painting?

141
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
So I decided that

142
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,520
the Black Hand of the Wood is definitely a person.

143
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
And I also found that

144
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
as long as I don't change the language and the action,

145
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
no one else will change.

146
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
But only you

147
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
will be different.

148
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Brother, is it hurt?

149
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
What are you waiting for?

150
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Come on, help me up.

151
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Okay.

152
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
What's going on?

153
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Why are you here?

154
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Are you okay?

155
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Brother, is it hurt?

156
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
What are you waiting for?

157
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Come on, help me up.

158
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
What's going on?

159
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Why are you here?

160
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,520
We're talking about the work.

161
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Awesome.

162
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm impressed.

163
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
You've been a teacher for so long.

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Don't you know what you're called?

165
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,520
My name is Shun.

166
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Shun?

167
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
What's your name?

168
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Shun.

169
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Nice name.

170
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
It suits you.

171
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
It's been a long time

172
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
since I've been so happy.

173
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm a good-hearted man.

174
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I'm lucky to have the energy to open the spiritual realm.

175
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Open the spiritual realm?

176
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
What's the point of that?

177
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Can you get the long-term power

178
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
but only by using your body?

179
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I dare not use it.

180
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
I only use it

181
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
to make a thousand years of suffering.

182
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
That's why I'm so proud of it.

183
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
One day,

184
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I came to Guangping.

185
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Guangping is so beautiful.

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I used to be a beauty-lover.

187
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I didn't know there was such a beautiful place

188
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
in this world.

189
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
The rain is so beautiful.

190
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
The world is so beautiful.

191
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
It's a wonderful place.

192
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Do you know the lake?

193
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
I've never been there.

194
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
It's in the city of Guangping.

195
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Come on.

196
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
It's so beautiful.

197
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
The sun is shining.

198
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I can't stop thinking about it.

199
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
I can't stop thinking about it.

200
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I even drank a cup of wine

201
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
and watched the lake.

202
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I wandered around the night view of Guangping.

203
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
I wandered around the night view of Guangping.

204
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
I wandered around the night view of Guangping.

205
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
The scenery of the world is so beautiful.

206
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
The city of the earth is so beautiful.

207
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
I know I'm drawing a painting for it.

208
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
So I came to the underground city.

209
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
I'm going to do this

210
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
for the spring.

211
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
I'm going to put the plants in the city

212
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
and the people in the city

213
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
will be excited.

214
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
And this painting

215
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
is a hundred years.

216
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
A hundred years.

217
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
But when I thought about it,

218
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
I found that it seemed too simple.

219
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
I couldn't capture

220
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
the real and reliable person

221
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Wu Shenyun.

222
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
The Mo people are always heartless.

223
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
And that natural god

224
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
is so great.

225
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
It's not my ability to make a mistake.

226
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
So you just want to

227
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
draw a painting for the living?

228
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
The chief of the Tang family,

229
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
the Prince of Xin'an,

230
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
the Taoist master of the Yinyuan family

231
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
and the mother of the Banxia family

232
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
are all you, right?

233
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Some things are not true.

234
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
For example,

235
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Prince of Xin'an

236
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
is the one who died.

237
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
If he didn't have me,

238
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
he would have been a emperor.

239
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I gave him my life,

240
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
but he didn't give me the money.

241
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Then why did you send Chi Wangchuan

242
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
to capture the Banxia's father?

243
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I was drawing the Banxia's father.

244
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
But no matter what,

245
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I couldn't draw

246
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
the god of the Chui Lei Guan Yin.

247
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
So I had to go out and travel

248
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
to the capital to marry Tian Yi.

249
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I met the Tang family

250
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
who came to the city

251
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
to look for their daughter.

252
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
The Tang family's daughter

253
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
was so kind and brave

254
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
that she cried

255
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
and thought of

256
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
another way to make Guan Yin.

257
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
But Guan Yin was going to the city

258
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
and she was tired.

259
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I had to go to the capital

260
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
to talk to her

261
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
in a good way.

262
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
But she wrote a poem

263
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
that was fake.

264
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
She said

265
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
she wrote a poem

266
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
and talked about the love of the two.

267
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
But she sent me out

268
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
without being recorded.

269
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
That's what she wrote.

270
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
She made me realize

271
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
that she and her husband

272
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
were very close.

273
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
So I thought

274
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
if she captured her husband

275
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
and put him in front of her

276
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
and they were in the capital

277
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
but couldn't take care of each other,

278
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
would she be tired?

279
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
You really have to work hard.

280
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
I just want to be a good person.

281
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
I have no other intentions.

282
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
There's no other intention!

283
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
I don't know how many people

284
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
have destroyed your painting.

285
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
I'll kill you

286
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
and avenge my parents for you.

287
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Are you okay?

288
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Why is that?

289
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
She's the owner of the painting.

290
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
She can't even get hurt

291
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
by the painting.

292
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
How did she think of it?

293
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
What did you do?

294
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
What did you do?

295
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Don't you know?

296
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Mother.

297
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Mother, you already know

298
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
the spell.

299
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
The spell?

300
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
You're the one

301
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
who's been so kind to her?

302
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
What kind of a god is she?

303
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Don't put a gold coin on her face.

304
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
You're just a dead person.

305
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
You're not even as good as

306
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
the evil spirit.

307
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
There's a book called

308
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
The White Demon Pond.

309
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You must have read it.

310
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
The evil spirit?

311
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
It's like a sand

312
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
that falls on the sand

313
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
and falls on the sand.

314
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
It's like a sand

315
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
that falls on the sand

316
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
and falls on the sand.

317
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
It'sや rockhopped.

318
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Would you see emptiness?

319
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It's like

320
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
that.

321
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,520
Something like that too.

322
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
The에 embassy,

323
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
the embassy,

324
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,520
the besieged Embassy...

325
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
and the outside world,

326
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
those people.

327
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
You're lucky to

328
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
have...

329
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
ones.

330
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
All of them were because of Wu Yi's magic.

331
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
That's why I opened the spiritual realm.

332
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Wu Yi is extraordinary.

333
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
You're not a fairy or a spirit.

334
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
You're not a beast.

335
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
You're just a beast.

336
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm not!

337
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
You're a demon.

338
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
You're practicing death.

339
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
You can't stop the loneliness.

340
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,520
You finally got the magic.

341
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
You went to Guangping City.

342
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
You saw another beautiful scene

343
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
in the underground city of the dark day.

344
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
You said you saw Guangping Nightfall.

345
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
That's a lie.

346
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Because you don't dare to see the moon.

347
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Today is the fifteenth day.

348
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Don't you cry through sorrow?

349
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,520
L應該,

350
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Don't cry by sorrow.

351
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Don't cry последimous.

352
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Che realize it.

353
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,520
It is like a treasure box fake science books.

354
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,320
and the world's law of creating small money

355
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,160
when the need arises.

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,320
In your opinion,

357
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,840
the beauty of the world is beyond the wide-angle.

358
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,520
Being able to have a wide-angle that belongs to yourself

359
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,000
makes you unable to go back to your original idea.

360
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,360
As a pitiful and ungrateful pet,

361
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,800
I believe you only need to have one lesson

362
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,840
and you dare not think about it again.

363
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,520
So, someone has brought you to the wide-angle.

364
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,920
He has asked you about the past for a thousand years.

365
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,120
When you comes with the mind and body

366
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,760
of your own person,

367
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,800
say no more.

368
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Stop doing that.

369
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,040
Are you out of your mind?

370
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,440
Which should make you savory?

371
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,480
Do you think Huang Yan prone by Chai Chuan

372
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,220
or thought he held a gun over

373
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,820
I said it and my answer is great.

374
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,380
What a pitiful fellow.

375
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,540
I'm not...

376
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,820
I'm not a pitiful fellow!

377
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,060
How did you know that?

378
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,420
There are too many breakthroughs.

379
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,900
You want to draw a beautiful landscape,

380
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,340
but you can't draw it.

381
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,300
In this world,

382
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,060
the person you're drawing is also a dead end.

383
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,780
It seems that you don't know

384
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,300
that there are two different things in this world.

385
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,420
Plus, the awakening of the half-sword and the King of the New Year,

386
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,620
your identity naturally opens up.

387
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,660
Smart.

388
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,220
Smart, you're smart.

389
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,780
But do you know what happened to Liu Nanze?

390
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,260
This is the world I created.

391
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,020
You can't get out of it

392
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,060
without hurting me.

393
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:41,580
L later, Ling我有

394
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,620
What happened to that time?

395
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,660
What did you do to him?

396
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,140
I didn't do anything.

397
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,460
It's your rule to break the rules of the world.

398
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,060
It seems that it won't be long.

399
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,300
You will be like the new Prince of An.

400
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,700
You will be completely removed from the world.

401
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,860
You've been removed from the world.

402
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,340
You still don't admit your mistake?

403
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,940
It's not too late.

404
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,820
Let go of the others.

405
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,180
I can spare you.

406
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,020
Let go?

407
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,260
Let go?

408
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,700
Where can I let go?

409
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,220
The world is suffering.

410
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,100
You know it.

411
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,780
People are suffering.

412
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,340
But in the past 100 years,

413
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,660
if you let go of the others,

414
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,420
even if you let go of the others,

415
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,020
you can't let go of the others.

416
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,460
You must be careful when you want to die.

417
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,340
You must suffer from the suffering of the old man.

418
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,020
You must be careful when you want to die.

419
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,780
You must be careful when you want to die.

420
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,500
In my opinion,

421
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,980
there is only one person in this life.

422
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,740
You must live forever.

423
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,780
You must live forever.

424
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,340
There is nothing to fear in life.

425
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,940
There is nothing to fear in death.

426
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,620
The past is like a dream.

427
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,300
Isn't this real?

428
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,820
Is it a big disaster?

429
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,820
But this is all fake.

430
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,020
What is it?

431
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,220
Fake?

432
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,300
You...

433
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,460
Tell me.

434
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,460
This is all fake.

435
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,140
Tell me what is real?

436
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,660
You must know everything about you.

437
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,380
You must know you are not the old man in the front,

438
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,340
not the child on the stage.

439
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,060
You must know everything about you.

440
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,540
You must know everything about you.

441
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,620
You must know that you are not the old man in the front,

442
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,460
not the son on the stage.

443
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,100
You must know everything about you.

444
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,100
You must know your future is not in your hands.

445
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,180
You must be careful when you go above.

446
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,220
You must know everything about you.

447
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,700
True, true, true.

448
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,300
But it's just a dream.

449
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,900
You're quite a good talker.

450
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,220
You've been lying to yourself

451
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,660
all these years.

452
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,220
Kid,

453
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,140
I wanted to keep you.

454
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,380
But you've lost your memory.

455
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,100
I can't keep you anymore.

456
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
What should we do?

457
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
We can't kill him.

458
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
We can.

459
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Look,

460
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,380
the moon is out.

461
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,820
Where is my bottle?

462
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,340
Scatter off,

463
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,900
or I'm done waiting for you.

464
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,500
I have no money.

465
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,860
i need it.

466
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,960
No.

467
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,860
i won't shoulder your loss.

468
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,260
Let the Landesregierung

469
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,940
go after him!

470
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Get over here.

471
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,220
Wow, this is so beautiful.

472
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,220
The moon, the moon, the moon.

473
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
It's so beautiful.

474
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
It's so bright.

475
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,220
It's really beautiful.

476
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Madam.

477
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm...

478
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
What's that?

479
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I'm a big brother.

480
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Where is he?

481
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
What is that?

482
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
What is that?

483
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
That's the moon.

484
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
It's beautiful, right?

485
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Why is the moon here?

486
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Since the sound can be heard,

487
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
the atmosphere is also good.

488
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,220
I like the soup of Yang Fei's soup.

489
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,220
This is the moon.

490
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
It's so beautiful.

491
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
It's so beautiful.

492
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Madam.

493
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,220
It's so beautiful.

494
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,220
It's so beautiful.

495
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
It's so beautiful.

496
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,220
Go away. Don't bother me.

497
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,220
What's your name?

498
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm Man Ying. Go away.

499
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,220
Master.

500
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,220
I'm back.

501
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Wei Zao.

502
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,220
I've been looking for you for 12 years.

503
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,220
I haven't found you in two years.

504
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,220
I'm sorry.

505
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
I'm sorry.

508
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
I'm sorry.

510
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
I'm sorry.

512
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm sorry.

513
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
I'm sorry.

514
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,220
I think

515
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
Second Prince

516
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220
should be dead.

517
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
No.

518
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Shaolin has his blood.

519
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
If he dies,

520
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,220
the blood will disappear.

521
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Give me the talisman.

522
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
You can only save one person.

523
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
There's no need to go through two mountains.

524
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
Master.

525
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
Can't you take Second Prince back?

526
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,220
The 12 years have passed.

527
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,220
The barrier is open.

528
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
I have to take him back

529
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
before father comes back.

530
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,220
You mean

531
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Second Prince doesn't want to come back?

532
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
I will take him back.

533
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,840
The

534
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
The common barrier is

535
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
the death of the living.

536
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
But this is not the case.

537
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
Xuanye said he has been hiding in the underground city for hundreds of years.

538
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
He can't see the moon

539
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
unless he sees the sun.

540
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
He created a world

541
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
in order to be able to see the sun.

542
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
The grass there is so green.

543
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
There's no one.

544
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
It's because of his thoughts.

545
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,220
He can't escape.

546
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
How can you escape?

547
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
It's so hard.

548
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Yes.

549
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
He did lose his hand.

550
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,220
We were so close.

551
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,220
We almost lost our lives.

552
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Luckily, we saw the illusion

553
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
and defeated the monster.

554
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
It's so ridiculous.

555
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Who would have thought

556
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
there's such a monster in the world?

557
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
Who said it's not true?

558
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
If I hadn't experienced it,

559
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,220
I wouldn't have thought it.

560
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,220
And then?

561
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
The monster was afraid of the moon.

562
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,220
When he saw Xuanye's treasure,

563
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
he was so happy.

564
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
When he died,

565
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
the world was broken.

566
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
The living people

567
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
were restored to the gods

568
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,220
and were so comfortable.

569
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,220
The people in the winter

570
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
were also very active.

571
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
The victims were sent back home.

572
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
Sima, Sizi.

573
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
Didn't you see that painting?

574
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
No.

575
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,220
That's so unfortunate.

576
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,220
Yes.

577
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,220
It's a pity that

578
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,220
we didn't participate in such a cruel thing.

579
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Or else,

580
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
we could have fought with Chu buttocks

581
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
and killed the monster.

582
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
You can't say that.

583
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
You were also a good person outside.

584
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
Yes.

585
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
Tianzhou.

586
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Where's your lady?

587
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
She's in the second floor.

588
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
Xuanye's room?

589
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
Why didn't you come down?

590
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,220
I'll go find her.

591
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Sit down.

592
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
Talk to Wemutou.

593
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,220
How did I deal with it?

594
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Why did you ask me to do it?

595
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
Didn't you get drunk?

596
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Didn't you say it was nice?

597
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Talk again.

598
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Sima, Sizi, is looking for us outside.

599
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
She found the bookshelf

600
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
without any reason.

601
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
She was so confused.

602
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,220
She killed that monster.

603
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,220
Are you done talking?

604
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Yes.

605
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
I'm in the painting.

606
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
You can make up for the rest.

607
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
Are you still drunk?

608
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Why do I feel so big?

609
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
Are you thin these days?

610
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
I'm not thin.

611
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
Look at your waist.

612
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
It's big.

613
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
I was just two days ago.

614
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
You haven't eaten?

615
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
I've eaten.

616
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
You don't look good.

617
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
Don't I look good?

618
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Maybe you've been

619
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,220
sleeping in a dream

620
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
lately.

621
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,220
What dream?

622
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
I can't remember.

623
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Take it off.

624
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
I'll change it for the tailor later.

625
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
No need to change it.

626
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,220
I think it's good now.

627
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
And the fabric is very comfortable.

628
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,220
Thank you.

629
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,220
The fabric is my mom's.

630
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I picked it.

631
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,220
I picked the fabric.

632
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
It's good.

633
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
I'll do it.

634
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
Xuanyi.

635
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,220
What's wrong?

636
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Can you fix

637
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
this broken piece?

638
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,220
My dad didn't teach me

639
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
how to fix it.

640
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,220
My dad left me

641
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
a protective weapon.

642
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
I wanted to stay by his side

643
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
for a long time

644
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
and be a thought.

645
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
But I didn't expect

646
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
that the world in the painting

647
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
would be damaged

648
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,220
by the sound of the sound.

649
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
What a pity.

650
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,220
Why don't you go to the office

651
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
and come to my house?

652
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
You Huang is telling me

653
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,220
about your underground experience.

654
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,220
Xuanyi,

655
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,220
tell me.

656
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
You don't look good

657
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
with such a wonderful thing.

658
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,220
I'm going back to Shendu tomorrow.

659
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
I set up a banquet

660
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
in Yanlan House this afternoon.

661
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
Please enjoy the light.

662
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
You're leaving so soon?

663
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
It's so soon.

664
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
We've been out of the underground city

665
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
for half a month.

666
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,220
If we don't leave,

667
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
we'll have to stay for a year.

668
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
You're so lucky.

669
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,220
What's wrong?

670
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
Don't you want me to stay here?

671
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,220
I don't dare.

672
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
The case of Prince of Xin'an

673
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,220
has been investigated.

674
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,220
Do you want to

675
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,220
go back to Shendu with me

676
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
and take the credit?

677
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Thank you, Minister of Justice.

678
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
I'm just a small supplement.

679
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,220
I can find out the truth

680
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,220
by using my personal skills

681
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,220
and my skills.

682
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I'll just go back

683
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,220
to the palace.

684
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
I'm not sick.

685
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Okay.

686
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,220
I'll go back to Yaman House now.

687
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,220
See you in the afternoon.

688
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,220
I'll go back now.

689
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
Miss.

690
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,220
This is so pretty.

691
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Choose this one, Miss.

692
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Miss.

693
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Do you think

694
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,220
Miss Sima

695
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
likes different things?

696
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
How do you see it?

697
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
It's obvious.

698
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,220
It's the same as

699
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,220
the eyes of Dr. Jiu.

700
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Really?

701
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Miss.

702
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,220
You've been back for more than half a month.

703
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Why hasn't Dr. Jiu

704
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,220
proposed yet?

705
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Didn't you tell him

706
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
that you're going to

707
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
get rid of Prince Li?

708
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,220
My parents

709
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
have been in the painting for so long.

710
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,220
They must be very angry.

711
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,220
They must be very strict.

712
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,220
They can be angry

713
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
when they write.

714
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,220
It's so hard for Xuanye.

715
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,220
He must be strict.

716
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
Then,

717
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
do we need to go back to Yuanzhou?

718
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
You don't want to go back to Yuanzhou?

719
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
You don't want to go back to Yuanzhou?

720
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Is it because you're back in Yuanzhou

721
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
that you can't see the blood?

722
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
What are you talking about, Miss?

723
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
The blood is a demon.

724
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,220
It's a rabbit.

725
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
How can a person

726
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
be with a rabbit?

727
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
What's wrong with the demon?

728
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
What's wrong with the rabbit?

729
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
You can't even open it?

730
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
You're not...

731
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Anyway, a person has to be different.

732
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
You're different from a rabbit.

733
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
If you're changed,

734
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
would you like to be with a demon?

735
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
I would.

736
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,220
You're so stupid.

737
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
You're going to be with Dr. Jiu anyway.

738
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
Of course you can say nonsense.

739
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
Miss, do you want to choose?

740
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
I'll help you choose if you don't want to.

741
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,220
I'll go.

742
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
Ming An.

743
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,220
Ba Xia.

744
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Where are you going

745
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
in such a hurry?

746
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
Sister Sima

747
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,220
from Shendulai is going back.

748
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,220
We'll send her off.

749
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,220
What's the matter?

750
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220
Is that woman from the government

751
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,220
who did the job?

752
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Then come back earlier.

753
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,220
Don't drink too much.

754
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Okay.

755
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,220
I'll go first.

756
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,220
Every year,

757
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
the Dragon City is lit up.

758
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,220
The people are so beautiful.

759
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
The ancient temple.

760
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
That's so hot.

761
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
It's not suitable for you to come here.

762
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
Come back next time.

763
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,220
I'll go first.

764
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Please come in.

765
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
Ba Xia.

766
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,220
Why are you late?

767
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,220
My lady changed her clothes.

768
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,220
She changed her watch.

769
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
Let's wait for everyone.

770
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Yes.

771
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,220
The people are here.

772
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,220
Let's go.

773
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,220
Let's go.

774
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,220
This time, the square is square.

775
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,220
Please follow us.

776
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,220
I'm going back to Shendulai tomorrow.

777
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,220
It's not appropriate to see you again.

778
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
I'm sorry for the delay.

779
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,220
Thank you.

780
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,220
You're so polite.

781
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
You Huang is my good friend.

782
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,220
I'll take the position as my superior.

783
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,220
Yes.

784
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,220
I'm just a good friend.

785
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
Why isn't my big plate here?

786
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,220
Xiao'er.

787
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,220
Xiao'er.

788
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Xunyi.

789
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,220
Help me to ask.

790
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,220
No.

791
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Ba Xia.

792
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,220
Have some fish.

793
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,220
I picked the toilet for you.

794
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,220
I'm sorry.

795
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,220
I'm sorry.

796
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
I'm sorry.

797
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,220
I'm sorry.

798
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,220
I'm sorry.

799
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,220
I'm sorry.
