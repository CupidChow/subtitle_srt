[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,530
Since His Lordship is with us today,

4
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,200
Mr. Duan, why don't you compose another poem?

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,130
Yes, don't be so modest!

6
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,789
Give us another!

7
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,910
Give us another!

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,580
What's the point of just writing poems?

9
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,729
His Lordship

10
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,289
didn't gather us here today

11
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,640
just to seek talent.

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,000
Then tell us, young scholar,

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,760
what do you think

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,730
this banquet is really for?

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,840
Today, His Lordship

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,840
gathered us all here at this banquet

17
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
to make a statement to the world:

18
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,230
as long as you have the talent,

19
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,030
you can take the imperial examination.

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,079
From this day forward,

21
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,710
we'll all be his protégés

22
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,490
and representatives

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,290
of scholars of humble origins.

24
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,030
One day,

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,760
if we succeed in the exam,

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,490
we'll all remember this day

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,470
and where we came from.

28
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,150
That makes so much sense.

29
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,210
Well said, indeed!

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,590
Well said.

31
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,280
Well said!

32
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,120
Well said!

33
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,430
Jiu, you have great talent

34
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,960
and such remarkable insight.

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,420
I'm genuinely impressed.

36
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,680
You and I clicked the moment we met.

37
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,630
From now on,

38
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,640
you're like a brother to me.

39
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,150
Liu,

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,430
you've spoken

41
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,160
what I've long felt in my heart.

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,910
Meeting all of you

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
is the greatest honor of my life.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,630
Since we all share the same goal

45
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,830
and the same beliefs,

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
why don't we swear a blood oath

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,650
and become sworn brothers?

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,140
Excellent idea. Excellent idea.

49
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,250
Let me borrow this.

50
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,100
After drinking the blood wine,

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,170
we'll be family.

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Well...

53
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,310
I'm in!

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,890
It's your turn.

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,490
Alright!

56
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,290
Let's all do it!

57
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,680
Sure, let's do it.

58
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,960
It's all ink.

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,470
Raise your cups.

60
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,080
Cheers!

61
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,190
Cheers!

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,070
Come on.

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,990
Good wine!

64
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,750
Refreshing!

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,680
Please, please.

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,900
How come there's not even one?

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,270
And we made

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,310
such a commotion,

69
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,430
but there's no reaction from behind at all.

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,690
Something must be off.

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
You can go take a look.

72
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,890
With this many people? How?

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,310
You can do it.

74
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,120
Chancellor Cao,

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,070
Mr. Duan would like to perform

76
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,430
a sword dance for everyone.

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,690
Would that be alright?

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,790
Mr. Duan knows swordplay?

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,940
Just a little.

80
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,620
Just a little.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,750
Go on.

82
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,490
Master of the sword.

83
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,310
I-I don't know how…

84
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,750
Lord Xin'an didn't come.

85
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,310
Those scholars are all very disappointed.

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,270
It's alright.

87
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,360
Tomorrow, they

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
will cheer up.

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,270
But think about it—

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,600
this person painted the Night Banquet at South Lake

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,660
but didn't include Lord Xin'an in it.

92
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,070
Right.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,360
Xuanye,

94
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,190
my dad remembers his own name,

95
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,310
so just like us, he didn't lose his memories.

96
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,120
That means

97
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,140
he wouldn't act according to

98
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,600
the role he was given in the painting, right?

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,720
You think Lord Xin'an is your dad?

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
This is the easiest place to stay hidden.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
Split up and search.

102
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,510
Yes!

103
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,510
My Lord, over there…

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,010
Does what you said yesterday still count?

105
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,430
W-What did I say?

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,120
Yesterday, you said you like me.

107
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,190
You don't know

108
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,240
when it started,

109
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,490
but it feels like it's been a long time.

110
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,200
You remember it all?

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
I thought you'd forget—

112
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,290
that's why I said it.

113
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,420
Whether I remember it or not doesn't really matter.

114
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,410
Then I'll say it.

115
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,950
Yes,

116
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,360
I had many concerns before.

117
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,820
I'm engaged.

118
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,720
But I don't like

119
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,950
that man at all.

120
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,180
Still, I know…

121
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,180
it's not

122
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,170
exactly proper between us.

123
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,720
But after everything we've been through,

124
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,630
I've realized…

125
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,789
I really like you.

126
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,049
So no matter what you say,

127
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,809
I've made up my mind about you.

128
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,920
Let's go!

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,510
You don't like me,

130
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,730
and you're fixated on him?

131
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,550
He Quelian!

132
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,130
You've gone too far!

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,630
After them!

134
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
They didn't catch up.

135
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,290
[Fa'en Temple]

136
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,150
Why don't we

137
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,610
hide in the temple for now?

138
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,150
It's a sacred place.

139
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,900
We'll have the protection of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

140
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,560
I don't believe

141
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,420
Youhuang would dare to kill here.

142
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,320
Let's go.

143
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,570
What are you doing?

144
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,210
I need to test something.

145
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,670
T-Test what?

146
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,500
You don't actually think

147
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
this is my mom, do you?

148
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,870
The biggest wonder of the Fair at Flower Festival

149
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,480
is this weeping statue of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,770
Guanyin Bodhisattva shows compassion and mercy to all beings.

151
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,770
That's what you call a true blessing—

152
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,170
a wonder in its own right.

153
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,150
Mom?

154
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,090
Is that you?

155
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
H-How is this possible?

156
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,220
Why is my mom here?

157
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
Why has she become like this?

158
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,670
Mom.

159
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,870
Do you remember me?

160
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,070
I'm Banxia.

161
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Mom.

162
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,240
I-I'm Banxia.

163
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,350
What happened to you?

164
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,960
Dad?

165
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,470
Banxia.

166
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,210
Are you sure this is your dad?

167
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,480
Dad.

168
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,870
Dad.

169
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Dad.

170
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,010
Dad, what's wrong with you?

171
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,670
It's me.

172
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,670
It's me.

173
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm Banxia.

174
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,560
It's me, Banxia.

175
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,740
What's wrong with you?

176
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,510
You...

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,550
Dad, what happened to you?

178
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,360
Dad.

179
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,230
Big Brother, did that fall hurt?

180
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,590
Get up, get up.

181
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,300
Big Brother, Big Brother!

182
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,210
Big Brother!

183
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,830
Big Brother!

184
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Where is he going?

185
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
Hit!

186
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,280
Hit.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,510
Hit.

188
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,270
First, I'll gouge out your eyes.

189
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,290
Then, I'll cut off your nose and mouth.

190
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,170
Finally, I'll chop off your head.

191
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,430
I'll chop off…

192
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,360
your head.

193
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,480
How did you get out?

194
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,510
This is outrageous.

195
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,120
All of you, go to hell!

196
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,360
Banxia.

197
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,850
Why can't my dad see,

198
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,870
hear, or speak?

199
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,650
His three senses have been sealed.

200
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,400
He's completely shut off from the outside world.

201
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,040
Was it that demon?

202
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,210
I've been wondering the same.

203
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,730
Why wasn't it enough

204
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,200
for that demon

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,440
to capture your mom?

206
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,840
Why did he have to take your dad too?

207
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,960
Now I understand.

208
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,270
It's for the weeping effect.

209
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,330
He placed your mom here,

210
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,080
but a Guanyin Bodhisattva statue that doesn't weep

211
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,740
can't be considered a wonder.

212
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,790
He really went to great lengths.

213
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,240
Dad.

214
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,120
I will definitely get you and Mom

215
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
out of here.

216
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,840
Wait for me.

217
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,550
Don't worry too much.

218
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,440
Your dad's senses are only

219
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,480
temporarily sealed by a demonic spell.

220
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,810
Once he's out of this place, he'll be fine.

221
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,920
Hurry!

222
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,640
Let's go.

223
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,240
Constable Liu.

224
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,319
Constable Liu!

225
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,230
Mrs. Huang?

226
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,120
Why have you followed us here?

227
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,160
What's wrong?

228
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,530
Chief is at the government office now.

229
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,070
Please don't be upset.

230
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,880
He's not backing out of the engagement.

231
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,310
A criminal picked today,

232
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,200
of all days, to break out of prison.

233
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,240
Chief had no choice

234
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,560
but to postpone the wedding

235
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,290
and lead the team to arrest him.

236
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,520
Have there been

237
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,010
any prison breaks before?

238
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,400
The world in the painting has changed.

239
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
Who escaped?

240
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,680
A desert bandit.

241
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,700
What does he look like?

242
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,070
He's in his fifties, with a face full of wrinkles.

243
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,880
Not very tall,

244
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
but extremely ruthless.

245
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,920
It's the demon from the Enlightenment Bookstore.

246
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,080
Where is he now?

247
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,810
It's said he went to the west of the city.

248
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,440
Mrs. Huang,

249
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,480
we'll be going now.

250
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,010
Let's go.

251
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,970
Let's go.

252
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,240
This man

253
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,030
is a desert bandit from Hukou Fortress.

254
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,160
He's highly skilled in martial arts

255
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,490
and extremely vicious.

256
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,850
He's taken more than a dozen lives.

257
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,880
Just earlier,

258
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,830
he broke out of prison

259
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,480
and killed several of our men.

260
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,590
So,

261
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,190
we must capture him as soon as possible!

262
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,640
Has everyone seen his face clearly?

263
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
Yes!

264
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,720
Aren't we heading west?

265
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,580
Why are we here?

266
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,400
That's far from here.

267
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's steal a horse. Come on.

268
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,590
Quelian?

269
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,730
Quelian, I'm sorry.

270
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,640
We may have to

271
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,930
postpone our wedding.

272
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,730
It's alright.

273
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,760
I understand.

274
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Catching the criminal comes first.

275
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,240
Who is this?

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
M-My friend.

277
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,510
My Lord!

278
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,550
My Lord.

279
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,510
The patrol guards

280
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,590
spotted the fugitive on Nanshun Street.

281
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,990
They've surrounded him.

282
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,640
Nanshun Street!

283
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,510
Yes!

284
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,030
Move out!

285
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,360
They took off with my horse.

286
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,100
What am I supposed to ride?

287
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,530
This is his territory.

288
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,010
We'll play it by ear later.

289
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:54,970
Got it.

290
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,490
It's you?

291
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,160
It's your head that I want!

292
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
Come and get it if you can!

293
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,830
He's not stronger than me,

294
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,090
and not faster either.

295
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,680
He's not

296
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,830
as powerful as you said.

297
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,400
Seems like his abilities are limited

298
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,450
inside the painting, just like mine.

299
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,490
Darn it!

300
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,320
Why are you this strong?

301
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,480
This is outrageous.

302
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,750
Outrageous!

303
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,550
Banxia.

304
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,490
This is outrageous!

305
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,780
Just you wait!

306
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,060
Make way!

307
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,090
Move aside! Move aside!

308
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,090
Step aside! Move!

309
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,210
Leave a few behind to help the wounded.

310
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,200
Everyone else, after them!

311
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,720
Yes!

312
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,240
Yes!

313
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,400
That looks like the direction of the Underground City.

314
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,320
That should be

315
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,880
his exit from the painting.

316
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,960
You're hot on my heels.

317
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,640
Demon,

318
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,720
you dragged my parents

319
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,350
into this!

320
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,310
I'll kill you!

321
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,420
How dare you sneak up on me?

322
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,160
Banxia.

323
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,750
Just you wait!

324
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,830
Banxia.

325
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,070
Banxia!

326
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,510
Just you wait.

327
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,590
I'll chop off your limbs first,

328
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,030
then break your spine,

329
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,710
and finally cut off your head!

330
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,260
This is outrageous. Outrageous!

331
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,150
No, no, no.

332
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,040
I'll break your spine first,

333
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,680
then chop off your limbs,

334
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,880
and finally cut off your head!

335
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,400
This is outrageous.

336
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Youhuang!

337
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,910
Find a physician to save Banxia!

338
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,720
Quelian.

339
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,280
Banxia.

340
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,240
-Banxia.
-Quelian!

341
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,000
Quelian, what's wrong with you?

342
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,110
Zhao Sheng, go get help!

343
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,720
Quelian.

344
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,780
Don't fall asleep!

345
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,640
Hang in there. Stop him!

346
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,240
Yes.

347
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,200
Banxia.

348
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,590
Quelian.

349
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,760
Who's locked up in here?

350
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,720
What did he do?

351
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,880
Lord Huang's bride

352
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,820
died.

353
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,610
He was right there when it happened.

354
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,720
No one knows who he is,

355
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,650
and he won't answer any questions.

356
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,920
Once Lord Huang recovers from the shock,

357
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,780
he'll probably interrogate him.

358
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,680
Big Brother, did that fall hurt?

359
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,140
Lift your foot! Your foot!

360
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,830
Big... Big Brother.

361
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,510
Big Brother.

362
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,880
Big Brother! Big Brother!

363
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Damao.

364
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,790
Ermao, Sanmao.

365
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,030
Simao.

366
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,490
What are you washing here?

367
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,240
Damao. Damao.

368
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,890
Big Brother!

369
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,730
Big Brother!

370
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,730
Big Brother!

371
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,510
Where's Big Brother?

372
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,530
Big Brother is lost again.

373
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,970
Go check the martial arts school.

374
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,110
Master He.

375
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,400
Master He, congratulations!

376
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Banxia.

377
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Thank you, thank you.

378
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,660
Banxia.

379
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,880
-Banxia.
-Who's that?

380
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,540
Who are you?

381
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,110
Banxia.

382
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,110
Banxia!

383
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,420
Why is he shouting like a lunatic?

384
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,220
Throw him out!

385
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,310
Stop him!

386
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,140
Banxia! Let me go!

387
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,160
Banxia!

388
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,750
Banxia!

389
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,110
Banxia!

390
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,720
Banxia!

391
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,580
Banxia!

392
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,550
Who is that?

393
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,010
You asked for this.

394
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,920
My Lady, do you know him?

395
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,840
The auspicious hour is approaching.

396
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,310
You need to hurry!

397
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,000
Stop! Stop!

398
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,020
Big Brother.

399
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,440
Are you alright, Big Brother?

400
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,170
Big Brother.

401
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,200
Guys,

402
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,350
he hit his head this morning

403
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,110
and suddenly lost his senses.

404
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,110
I apologize to you

405
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,830
on behalf of him.

406
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,000
Sorry.

407
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,250
Seriously,

408
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,180
what's wrong with you people?

409
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,480
He's lost his mind, and you still let him out?

410
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,030
We didn't keep an eye on him.

411
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,070
-It's our fault.
-Master He.

412
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,130
Please forgive him

413
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,770
and don't take offense.

414
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,480
Master…

415
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,680
It's a joyous occasion today.

416
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,210
I won't hold it against you.

417
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,070
Get out of here now.

418
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,790
Thank you, Master He.

419
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,990
Thank you, Master He.

420
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,340
Big Brother. Big Brother!

421
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,680
What's wrong with Big Brother?

422
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,070
Has he really gone mad?

423
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,880
I-I don't know.

424
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,640
He's never been

425
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
like this before.

426
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,040
He's wandering

427
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,090
in circles in the field.

428
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,020
What is he doing?

429
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,770
If he's gone mad,

430
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,190
that's a serious matter.

431
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,350
Wasn't there a river here before?

432
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,350
You could take a boat straight to the Underground City.

433
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,550
Why is the river gone?

434
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,500
Big Brother, what are you talking about?

435
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,720
Don't you know

436
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,060
there was a river here before?

437
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,920
I've never heard anything like that.

438
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
And I've certainly never heard of an Underground City.

439
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,720
N-Neither have I.

440
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,790
Never.

441
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,350
Surprised, aren't you?

442
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,960
Everything drawn with a brush

443
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,000
can be erased by a brush.

444
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,310
The vanishing of the Underground City is just the beginning.

445
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,680
You want to play?

446
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,200
Where's the ink? Where's the ink?

447
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
I need a lot of ink!

448
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,000
You'll get to play as long as you want.

449
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,830
A lot of ink, a lot of ink.

450
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,720
A lot of ink, a lot of ink!

451
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,370
These clothes

452
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,690
are our work uniforms.

453
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,180
Can't you be more careful?

454
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,590
You just pricked me.

455
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,910
Stop whining.

456
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,210
Brother,

457
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,770
I'm hungry.

458
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,640
Fourth Brother has been gone for ages.

459
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,910
Why isn't he back yet?

460
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,110
The money.

461
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,200
The money.

462
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,280
Brother,

463
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,560
i-it's getting dark.

464
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,590
A-Aren't you hungry? Don't you want to eat something?

465
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,750
Come back.

466
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,550
Give me the buns. Give them to me.

467
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,770
No matter how fast you run, it's useless.

468
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,600
Can you outrun that paintbrush?

469
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,360
What did you just say?

470
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,750
I said no matter how fast you are,

471
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,680
you can't outrun that paintbrush.

472
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,400
You shouldn't have gone to that bride either.

473
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,440
How did you know?

474
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,810
Who are you?

475
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,490
I'm someone who escaped

476
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,290
the Night Banquet at South Lake,

477
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,550
someone who ran away from his own story.

478
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,130
You are Lord Xin'an?

479
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,420
You've been to South Lake.

480
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,510
Why are you here?

481
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Isn't it obvious?

482
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,170
It's lively here during the day

483
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,440
and quiet at night.

484
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,040
Perfect for drinking in peace.

485
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,160
I'm asking

486
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,390
why you're inside the painting.

487
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,590
Young man,

488
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,680
what year is it now?

489
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,580
The 8th year of the Tianxiang Era.

490
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,480
It's only been two years.

491
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,030
But it feels like

492
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,960
hundreds of years have passed.

493
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,680
Two years ago,

494
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,690
I got a blood-borne disease

495
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,760
and searched far and wide for a cure, but I found none.

496
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,200
In the face of birth, aging, sickness, and death,

497
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,920
whether you're royalty

498
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,240
or a commoner,

499
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,030
everyone is the same.

500
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,810
Back then, someone told me

501
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,470
that in the Underground City,

502
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,360
there was a Living Healer named Huangfu Bai

503
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
who had miraculous healing skills.

504
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,270
I believed it

505
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,250
and came here with my servant.

506
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
You came seeking treatment?

507
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,800
Unfortunately, I was too late.

508
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,400
He said my condition was already terminal.

509
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,330
That there was nothing he could do.

510
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,270
Feeling frustrated,

511
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,530
I wandered around the Underground City.

512
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,090
Surprisingly, I found a glimmer of hope.

513
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,410
I came across the Enlightenment Bookstore.

514
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,830
The storekeeper there, Sha,

515
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,960
listened to my story

516
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,550
and told me he had a way to save me.

517
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,160
He said there was

518
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,510
an incredibly beautiful place in the world.

519
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,040
If I could enter that place,

520
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,720
I'd still be royalty,

521
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,080
and my illness would be gone.

522
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,020
Most importantly,

523
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,120
I'd live forever.

524
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
You believed him?

525
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,400
Of course.

526
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,030
You wouldn't understand

527
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,160
what it's like to be someone

528
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,960
clinging to life with no hope.

529
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,460
In those years,

530
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,640
I believed things far more

531
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,550
absurd than that.

532
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,270
Besides, what he said

533
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,530
wasn't entirely false.

534
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,540
So I stayed,

535
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,490
had my memories erased,

536
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,790
and spent every day in endless joy.

537
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,000
If I hadn't woken up,

538
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,270
perhaps

539
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,030
I would have

540
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,560
lived on like that forever.

541
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,600
How did you wake up?

542
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,070
I don't remember.

543
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,510
All I know is, one day,

544
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,720
I painted a picture—

545
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,230
an autumn moon scene.

546
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,360
And suddenly, I woke up.

547
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,230
I showed this painting

548
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,320
to my old servant,

549
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,030
and he woke up too.

550
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,250
Where's that painting?

551
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,199
It's gone.

552
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,320
I burned it.

553
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,130
Why did you burn it?

554
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,280
Because my servant died.

555
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,810
You don't understand.

556
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,090
Once you're awake,

557
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,139
if you refuse the arrangements in the painting,

558
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,920
you'll die.

559
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,000
Everything in this painted world

560
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,670
has been given new meaning.

561
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,710
Anyone who refuses to accept

562
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,630
the rules of this world,

563
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,000
denies their assigned role,

564
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,210
or refuses to believe

565
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,940
in the reality of this place

566
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,730
will be slowly erased.

567
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,630
And this erasure

568
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,940
is to make you completely disappear.

569
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,400
You'll turn…

570
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,800
transparent like glass

571
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,690
until you no longer exist.

572
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,590
What?

573
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,970
You believed it too?

574
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,290
Do you regret it?

575
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,490
Regret?

576
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,230
Regret coming here?

577
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,160
What's the use of regret?

578
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,880
It was my own choice.

579
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,410
But being trapped here day by day…

580
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,270
it doesn't feel like living.

581
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,020
It'd be easier to just vanish.

582
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,910
The Underground City used to be the way out.

583
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,130
It's gone now,

584
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,000
but there must be another way out.

585
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,760
There isn't.

586
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,920
I've tried everything.

587
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
Everything in this painting

588
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,430
is under his control—

589
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,340
the sun, moon, stars, heaven and earth…

590
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,250
even you and me!

591
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,740
If he's such a brilliant painter,

592
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,630
why can't he paint a moon?

593
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,060
[Missing]

594
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,630
Excuse me,

595
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,170
have you seen this person?

596
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,840
No.

597
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,330
Take a look.

598
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,320
I'll take this one.

599
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,230
The glaze color is nice.

600
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,710
Take a look.

601
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,150
Look.

602
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,650
What's wrong

603
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,110
w-with Big Brother?

604
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,250
I don't know.

605
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,760
Did he hit his head or something?

606
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,110
He can't drink like this.

607
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,360
He's downed several bottles in just a short while.

608
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,090
Big Brother,

609
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,750
you don't…

610
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,810
want to go to work today?

611
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,670
If Big Brother's not going,

612
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,400
t-then I...

613
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,210
I-I...

614
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,190
I-I won't go either.

615
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,130
What does it have to do with you?

616
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,450
If you really

617
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,140
don't want to go to work today,

618
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,540
then take a day off.

619
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,370
We're going to work.

620
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,040
I-I'm not...

621
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,380
If Big Brother's not going, I…

622
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:30,800
I-I...

623
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,510
Go to work!

624
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,510
Go to work!

625
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,970
Brother, let me take a sip.

626
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,430
I'm a bit thirsty.

627
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,450
Brother.

628
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,560
Save some for me.

629
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,670
Let's go, let's go.

630
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,840
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

631
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,440
You must come, you must come.

632
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,440
Thank you all.

633
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,960
Thank you, thank you.

634
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Thank you.

635
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,520
Thank you.

636
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,240
Big Brother.

637
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,030
Big Brother, Big Brother.

638
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,880
Move aside.

639
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,070
Big Brother, haven't you eaten all day?

640
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,590
Move aside!

641
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,250
You've been drinking all day?

642
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,800
Wine.

643
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,070
Go buy me more wine!

644
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,130
Alright, alright.

645
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,340
Big Brother, sit down for a while.

646
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,180
Sit down.

647
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,800
Third Brother, go buy it.

648
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Don't you have any sense?

649
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,060
You're holding all the money.

650
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,760
Get Big Brother something to eat while you're at it.

651
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,490
Big Brother.

652
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,550
What do you want to eat?

653
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,800
Noodles or flatbread?

654
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,510
Lamb lungs.

655
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,280
Buy some lamb lungs.

656
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,110
I want to drink lamb lung soup!

657
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,800
Alright.

658
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,700
Big Brother, you must be tired from drinking.

659
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,480
Here go the lamp lungs.

660
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,960
Okay.

661
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,720
Where are your manners?

662
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,480
Take a sip.

663
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,800
Big Brother.

664
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,630
This soup is too gamey and fishy to drink.

665
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,320
A-Add some of this.

666
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,220
-And some green onions.
-Is it ready?

667
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,030
Just a sec.

668
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,560
Almost done.

669
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,140
More green onions.

670
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,940
Green onions!

671
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,690
A lot of ink, a lot of ink.

672
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,760
A lot of ink, a lot of ink.

673
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,010
Sir, two pancakes, please.

674
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,940
Okay, these two are freshly baked.

675
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,030
I'll wrap them up for you.

676
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,760
Are they hot?

677
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,730
Here you are.

678
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,360
Sir.

679
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,750
Two pancakes, please.

680
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,630
Okay.

681
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,470
Here you go.

682
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,160
Alright.

683
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,840
Take care.

684
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,190
Okay.

685
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,120
It's done!

686
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,250
Where is he?

687
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,040
You brat, here you are.

688
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

689
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,400
I, Sha Man,

690
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,110
am coming for you!

691
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,020
What's going on?

692
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,340
Run!

693
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,510
Brat, you're quite agile.

694
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,790
Let's see how you can survive this.

695
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,730
Go get him!

696
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,640
Run!
