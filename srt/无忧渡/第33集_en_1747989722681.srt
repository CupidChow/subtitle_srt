1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Yon of Lethal

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The door is open.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 19

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sir, your high-end.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
One is not bad.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's very easy to get it.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm also a female.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, take it easy.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Where are you going?

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
High-end.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sir, take a look at the cloth.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's all good cloth.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Sir, take a look at the cloth.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Look at the left side.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sir, welcome.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sir, you bought so many things.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You must be excited to see this new home.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sir, you are very bright.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's very bright.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's so accurate.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Congratulations.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Since it's a new year,

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you must have good back.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come, this way, please.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let me show you.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
These are all good back.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Look.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This fabric

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
must be comfortable.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is it better?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Here.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They are all very good.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Look.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Look, it's so bright.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Look.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's so beautiful.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Enjoy your meal.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Welcome to the river.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Give me.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Go.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a small matter.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We should be careful.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I also bought some medicine and tonic.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You have it.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And you have the medicine.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are the doctor.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You should know it.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then, we should go back first.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You two

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
should rest here.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
how long it took

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to get here.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm afraid that

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wen Jian can't hold on to it.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm really sorry.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Where did you get this?

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We are all friends.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't be polite.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Fan Xia is a good girl.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't make her feel wronged.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I know.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Go.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are here.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong?

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've been in the orphanage for many years.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I lost my limit.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm so tired.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm so tired.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm so tired.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm so tired.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm so tired.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm so tired.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm so tired.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm so tired.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm so tired.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm so tired.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's someone out there

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
in the middle of the tunnel.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It can't be controlled in one hour.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But, I used

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the way to get the medical transfer

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
during this time.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I used

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
my dad's secret technique

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that he taught me.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
control the freedom

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
easily.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So,

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it's more convenient

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to find out who you are.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Eat now.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you okay?

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you okay?

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm okay.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Liar.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He won't cook or buy food.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Next time, I'll go to the town myself

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and buy some delicious food.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll make one for you.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll go with you.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll go with you.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Xuan Ye.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You said that the person who did that in the dark

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
was your brother, right?

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think it was the person who was in the pool last time.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you scared?

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not scared.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's just that he came here so many times.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't think he just wants to trouble you.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He wants you to go home, right?

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you want to go home?

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What if I go home?

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And I can't bear to see you.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. Don't think too much.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Eat up.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Xuan Ye.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Have you thought about how Huai Nanyang

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
told my parents?

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
To be honest.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How can you be honest?

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't let them know your identity.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Especially, you can't let my brother know.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Think about it.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
My brother and Nanyang's marriage

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
was planned by me.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If he knew that you were a demon,

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
he wouldn't have to make trouble.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can think of what he would say.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are a demon, Nanyang is a demon.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then why can't you be a demon?

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can't.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But it's definitely different.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Although you are all demons,

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Nanyang is a bad demon.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He killed people.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No matter what,

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you can't marry a murderer and go home.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But you are different.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You are a good person.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a great blessing

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to marry a person like you.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Marry?

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Marry is fine.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why are you laughing?

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You are 19 years old.

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why are you mentioning this?

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Just think about it.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If we have a daughter,

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
she will be able to look like you

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
after a long time.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't always treat me as a child.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Besides,

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you don't even have a marriage.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Where did you get this daughter from?

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Even if we get married one day,

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and we have a daughter,

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
she will not look like me.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Maybe she looks like you.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She is a little bun.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
My daughter is a little bun.

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Shunyi,

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
will our child be a demon?

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It should be.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How can I care about her?

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What is your group?

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The宣报 group.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The宣报 group.

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The宣报 group.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The宣报 group.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The宣报 group.

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then,

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
she will grow up.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She will be long-term.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
She has a long-term skin,

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
is full of skin and is very strong.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Baixia,

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
do you feel very wronged?

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't know

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
if it is good or bad.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I am sorry.

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I am sorry.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have a lot of things to think about.

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Since I can't change her,

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I choose to accept her.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If I always make things difficult for myself,

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I will never be able to go through this.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yuanyuan,

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
no matter what happens,

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it is our fate.

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We can only cherish it.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay, I will listen to you.

216
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Besides,

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
this good thing

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
can only happen

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
when we are together.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's eat.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Did you get the package?

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I couldn't let it run away.

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Forget it.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It is a blood of accident.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You can catch it, but you can't.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You can't catch it, but you can't.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Chunming,

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you must remember

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
that you can't shake the whole thing.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It is not enough to be greedy.

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We just need to take one goal

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and catch it in our hands.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What you said is true.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Master,

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
this is the thing you want to kill me.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The ancient enemy of the Xuanma Clan.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It is the assassin.

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Chunming,

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you have made a great contribution.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This ancient enemy

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
has a different demon clan.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He is a bit of a loser.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
With him,

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
he can't be defeated.

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
With him,

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
our plan will be more stable.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Come on.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is it beautiful?

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It is a bit big.

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We will go to the town tomorrow.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It is late.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's take a rest.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You take a rest.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I will sleep outside.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No.

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There is no place

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
to cover the rain.

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I will help you water.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I will help you water.

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Here.

262
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Where is the Sma Lingying?

263
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He is not here.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They are together.

265
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
How is the night?

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Did you find the place?

267
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I searched the yard

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
outside the city.

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I found the place.

270
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I found the place.

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I found the place.

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I found the place.

273
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I found the place.

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I searched the yard outside the city.

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I found the place.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I found the place.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Take care.

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I will come back when the wind blows.

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What does Dr. Aisheng do?

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He is fine.

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You don't understand.

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He has been practicing martial arts since childhood.

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
After his family died,

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
he took his father's sword

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and became a master.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Although he is not as good as a demon,

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the demons in his hands

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
have not been able to remember the magic.

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But I didn't expect

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
he is still a demon.

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I just worried that

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
he doesn't understand.

294
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's useless for you to worry about me.

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is his own business.

296
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He can only rely on himself.

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
How is Mr. Geng?

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Did he chase after him?

300
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He has been chasing after him for a long time.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He is like a famous man.

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He understands everything.

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He doesn't talk about it.

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Geng is a good man.

305
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But he is in trouble this time.

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Mr. Geng is a demon.

307
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He is a demon.

308
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He is a demon.

309
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He is a demon.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He is a demon.

311
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He is a demon.

312
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He is a demon.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He is a demon.

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He is a demon.

315
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He is a demon.

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He is a demon.

317
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He is a demon.

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He is a demon.

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He is a demon.

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You are awake.

321
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Why do I sleep here?

322
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You said that

323
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you have a good night's sleep.

324
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why do you sleep outside

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
when it is so cold?

326
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Luckily, I woke up last night

327
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and brought you in.

328
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What if I had a cold?

329
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Your father brought you in?

330
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
How can I bring you in

331
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
if you are so heavy?

332
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I must have dragged you in.

333
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You have a good night's sleep.

334
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why don't you wake up

335
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
when I drag you in?

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You are not awake.

337
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You can't sleep outside tonight.

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Or I will be angry.

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay.

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Wash your hands.

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Change your clothes.

342
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I will cook.

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Go to the table.

344
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It will be ready soon.

345
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Go to the table.

346
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It will be ready soon.

347
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Go to the table.

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

349
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Nothing happened.

350
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I am not going to the table.

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I am going to the table.

352
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I am going to the table.

353
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What happened?

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Last night, it was probably a cold.

355
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You felt a little cold

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and went back to your body.

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You went in the room

358
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and found a warm place to sleep.

359
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You didn't do it at my time.

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I woke up in the middle of the night

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and saw a scared one

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and accidentally injured myself.

363
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It has nothing to do with you.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Go to the table.

365
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It will be ready soon.

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can go to the table.

367
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I will go to the table.

368
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I will go to the table.

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I will go to the table.

370
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I will go to the table.

371
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I will go to the table.

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I will go to the table.

373
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I will go to the table.

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Xuan Yi.

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You said last time

376
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that you wanted to return to your brother

377
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
because of Bu Er Huan.

378
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Did you?

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It wasn't him.

380
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He just wanted to

381
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
clear my identity.

382
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't have the right to use that thing.

383
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You trust him a lot.

384
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Zikong is my brother-in-law.

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My mother died early.

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
When I was a kid, he was always with me.

387
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Although he is a king,

388
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
he won't really harm me.

389
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Have you finished eating?

390
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'll go and pack it up.

391
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll do it.

392
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll go and pack it up.

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What are you thinking about?

394
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't always think about it.

395
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You'll get old soon.

396
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You'll grow up again.

397
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What is this?

398
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,560
The little

399
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
Xuanye I embroidered myself.

400
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Is it cute?

401
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's cute.

402
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll give it to you.

403
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Xuanye.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Xuanye.

405
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Xuanye.

406
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What is Wu Youjing like?

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Didn't you go there?

408
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I was still young.

409
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I was so scared at that time.

410
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I was running away.

411
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I didn't have time to do anything.

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Wu Youjing

413
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
is a very big world.

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's about the same as here.

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What about your father?

416
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
My father?

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What kind of person is your father?

418
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
My father

419
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
is a very powerful person.

420
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He is the leader of the Xuan Bao Clan.

421
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He is the king of the guard of Wu Youjing.

422
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He is usually very busy.

423
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Besides at the Grand Cemetery,

424
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I rarely see him.

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Actually, we Xuan Bao Clan

426
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
have been the protectors of Wu Youjing since ancient times.

427
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We are responsible for guarding the gate and Wu Youcao.

428
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Your father is the leader.

429
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What about you?

430
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Do you want to be the leader?

431
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You?

432
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The leader?

433
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It sounds very dangerous.

434
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Men want to be the guards.

435
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you want to?

436
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What do you want to ask?

437
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't know.

438
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm just a little scared.

439
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm scared that you will become more and more powerful.

440
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You will think more and more about what you want to do.

441
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Do you want to go back home someday?

442
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm scared that you will leave me alone

443
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
when you leave me alone.

444
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't be scared.

445
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
No matter what happens,

446
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I will always be with you no matter what happens.

447
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No!

448
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
No!

449
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Xuan Ye.

450
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Calm down.

451
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm going to move.

452
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Xuan Ye.

453
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm going to move.

454
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Wake up.

455
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Xuan Ye.

456
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm going to move.

457
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Wake up.

458
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Wake up.

459
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm going to move.

460
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Wake up.

461
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Ba Xia.

462
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Ba Xia.

463
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Ba Xia.

464
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm fine.

465
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Ba Xia.

466
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Ba Xia.

467
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Ba Xia.

468
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The underground is full of traffic jams.

469
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Tong Mu Tong.

470
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's so early in the afternoon.

471
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Let's go to see Xuan Ye.

472
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Tomorrow is the day of the repair.

473
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We'll go there tomorrow.

474
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Tong.

475
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Brother.

476
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I heard that a new machine has arrived in Yan Lai Lou.

477
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Let's go and have a drink.

478
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Okay.

479
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You go ahead.

480
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm going back first.

481
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You're so anxious to go home.

482
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Is Sima Ling still living in your house?

483
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Mr. Tong.

484
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Are you going to have a drink?

485
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Let's go.

486
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What's going on?

487
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Why are you so badly injured?

488
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Please take care of Ba Xia for a while.

489
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Where are you going?

490
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I have something to do.

491
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If she wakes up,

492
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
tell her to wait for me here.

493
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Can you tell us what it is?

494
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Ba Xia is not feeling well now.

495
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Are you sure you want to leave now?

496
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Please.

497
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Xuan Ye.

498
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Xuan Ye.

499
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Xuan Ye.

500
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Why are you back?

501
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Uncle.

502
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I've decided.

503
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm going to go back to my room.

504
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'll go back to my room.

505
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll go back to my room.

506
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'll go back to my room.

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Xuan Ye.

508
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Xuan Ye.

509
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Xuan Ye.

510
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Xuan Ye.

511
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Xuan Ye.

512
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Xuan Ye.

513
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Xuan Ye.

514
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Xuan Ye.

515
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Xuan Ye.

516
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Xuan Ye.

517
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Xuan Ye.

518
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Ba Xia.

519
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Ling Ling went out to buy something.

520
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
She asked me to keep an eye on you.

521
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
She wants to drink it.

522
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Thank you.

523
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Did Xuan Ye say anything else?

524
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Xuan Ye asked you to take care of your wound.

525
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
She'll come back after she's done with the work.

526
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Don't think too much.

527
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Xuan Ye is not a reckless person.

528
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
She must have her reason to do this.

529
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Who?

530
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
She has her own reason to do this.

531
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Chu Bu Tao.

532
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Help me get a car.

533
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I want to go back to Nanyang.

534
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Why do you want to go back to Nanyang?

535
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I've been out for so long.

536
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The family must be worried.

537
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I know you're angry at Xuan Ye.

538
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Maybe she'll be back soon.

539
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Wait for her.

540
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm not angry.

541
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I like her so much.

542
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I know what kind of person she is.

543
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's better to wait for her than go home.

544
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Besides,

545
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
it's not convenient for you to live here.

546
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's not convenient.

547
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Ling is here.

548
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I can take care of you.

549
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Can you see it?

552
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's not easy.

553
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What a coincidence.

554
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We meet again.

555
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What's wrong with you?

556
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You kicked the iron board?

557
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I don't want to be your enemy.

558
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Don't follow me.

559
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Who's following you?

560
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I have something to ask you.

561
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Xuan Ye is gone again.

562
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Do you know that?

563
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I heard you're brothers.

564
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You bullied your brother like this.

565
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Do you know your parents?

566
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
When did he leave?

567
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't know.

568
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Where did he go?

569
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I have to ask you.

570
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
At first, we thought you came back to provoke him.

571
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Now I see you're not capable.

572
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm curious.

573
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Who made you do this?

574
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Tell me.

575
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'll go thank him.

576
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
What are you looking at?

577
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
What are you looking at?

578
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Even if you want to leave,

579
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
you don't have to be so anxious.

580
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Sima Li has gone to buy something.

581
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You wait for him to come back and talk.

582
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I think Tian Cui is still early.

583
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Why don't you wait for him?

584
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's not early to go out.

585
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We can't wait for him.

586
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We can wait for him tomorrow.

587
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Tomorrow is fine.

588
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Why don't you leave tomorrow?

589
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I can't wait for him.

590
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Liu Huang.

591
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Who is this?

592
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This is Dr. Jiu's brother.

593
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Another one is still in the hospital.

594
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yunyi.

595
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yunyi.

596
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You are not strong enough to suppress the antidote.

597
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You are not strong enough to suppress the antidote.

598
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
This method is very dangerous.

599
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I tell you.

600
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
This time,

601
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
you can't use it again.

602
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I have already mastered the magic of controlling the antidote.

603
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Why can't I master it now?

604
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't know.

605
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Uncle.

606
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You have lived in the underground city for so many years.

607
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You often communicate with the drugstore.

608
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You do business.

609
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Have you ever heard of

610
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yi'er?

611
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Have some tea first.

612
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I just know

613
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that my brother has a secret treasure.

614
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's called the ancient land.

615
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
He can let me lose my mind for now.

616
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I can't control the antidote.

617
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Before,

618
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
he used this method to force me to wake up.

619
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yunyi.

620
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If so,

621
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I can't get rid of him at this time.

622
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
How about this?

623
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I will ask the guards to find him out for you.

624
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank you, uncle.

625
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Where is Miss Duan?

626
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
She is hurt.

627
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
She was hurt by you?

628
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Uncle.

629
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Did you really

630
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
use the method of becoming a human

631
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to tell me that you have a drug?

632
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I didn't know how to use it.

633
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Did you wake up at the next day?

634
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No.

635
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Why are you here?

636
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Who hurt you?

637
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

638
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Of course it does.

639
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You are the brother of Xuanye.

640
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Although you are not kind to him,

641
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
but the same group.

642
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You are strong and strong.

643
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
If you can hurt your people,

644
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
you can hurt him.

645
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I have to ask you this.

646
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't know them.

647
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They have many people.

648
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
They are all drug dealers with illegal properties.

649
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
They are young and small.

650
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They are not in good health.

651
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Where are they?

652
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
underground.

653
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Why do they treat you like this?

654
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
An Ying.

655
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I think she told you about my arrival.

656
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's the 12th year of Jiangzhi.

657
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
When the door is opened,

658
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
it's our chance to go home.

659
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I came here to take her home.

660
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The door is opened once in the 12th year.

661
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
How did you come here?

662
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I have my way.

663
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But I have the limit.

664
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
One person can only do it once.

665
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I came out of the building.

666
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I found that the building was full of drugs.

667
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Later, I saw the whole group

668
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
pressing a drug dealer.

669
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
They said that if you jump into the tank,

670
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
you can remove the drug and hurt people.

671
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
What about the drug?

672
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's dead.

673
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Then they found me.

674
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I fought with them.

675
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
They are too many.

676
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I planned to leave here with An Ying.

677
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So they chased you because of this?

678
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Maybe.

679
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Then they followed me all the time.

680
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I was unconscious.

681
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I hit their ambush.

682
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's broken.

683
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
What?

684
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Suddenly, I remember

685
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
the former master of the night asked him.

686
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Whether he wants to be a demon or a human,

687
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
he can choose.

688
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That leader is An Ying's master?

689
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Then...

690
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Will he?

691
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Are you sure that the Xiguchi

692
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
can't be transferred to the human?

693
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Of course.

694
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
This is what I saw personally.

695
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It seems that the old man

696
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
wanted to hide An Ying in there.

697
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
No.

698
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I want to go to the underground.

699
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'll go with you.

700
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Let's go together.

701
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'll go with you.

702
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Wenjian, you don't go.

703
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's too dangerous.

704
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Besides, the Yangmen needs people.

705
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You stay here.

706
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If we have any trouble,

707
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you go to report to the general.

708
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Let him go and save him.

709
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's a secret.

710
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Then we'll leave the cave immediately.

711
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay.

712
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yangruo alive.

713
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'll go with you.

714
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You're so capable.

715
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We're Yangruo alive.

716
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Who tied you here?

717
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Father.

718
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Let's go.

719
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Father.

720
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Father.

721
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Father.

722
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Father.

723
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Father.
