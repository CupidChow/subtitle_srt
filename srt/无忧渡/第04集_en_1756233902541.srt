[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,990
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,430
Manniang?

4
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,290
You recognized me?

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,430
My name is Chi Xue.

6
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,430
We've met before.

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,250
What are you doing in Guangping City?

8
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,419
Did your brother marry a demon again?

9
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,240
Let's go.

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,690
[Tianji]

11
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,800
That's all.

12
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,030
Come, come.

13
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,079
Have some water.

14
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,440
Would you like some tea?

15
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,000
No need to trouble yourself.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,930
I'm not thirsty.

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,050
That's good.

18
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,329
We don't have tea anyway.

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,470
So, you suspect...

20
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,360
your father is still alive?

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,750
Yes.

22
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,650
Have you told your family?

23
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,070
I have.

24
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,000
But no one believed me.

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,000
I came to you

26
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,360
because I had no choice.

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,560
You believe me, right?

28
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,590
Was there anything unusual about the body?

29
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,080
No.

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,450
The officials examined the body.

31
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,290
But it could be fake, you know.

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,880
Maybe my father was captured by a demon.

33
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,870
He might still be alive,

34
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,400
right?

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,450
Perhaps.

36
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,240
Do you have any other clues?

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,240
Yes.

38
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,960
There are two mirrors.

39
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,780
One was found

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,990
in my father's room,

41
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,360
and the other was at the fire scene.

42
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,020
What's with these mirrors?

43
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,550
What's unusual about them?

44
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,570
When I first found them,

45
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,240
they didn't show any reflections.

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,700
But by the next day, they were back to normal.

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,700
The reason I came to find you

48
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,800
is that I hope you can accompany me

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,930
back to Nanyang City

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,120
to help me investigate

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,650
the truth behind my father's disappearance.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,120
No.

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,120
Why?

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,480
I have other things to do.

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
I can't leave for now.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,870
You should leave

57
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,070
Guangping as soon as possible.

58
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not leaving.

59
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,690
No one believes me.

60
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,829
Now, no one can help me

61
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,680
except you.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Do you have money?

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,770
We demon hunters

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
charge for our services.

65
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,040
I have money.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,190
Here.

67
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,210
This isn't enough.

68
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,430
There are 60 to 70 taels of silver in here.

69
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,830
Demons

70
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,750
are mostly vicious and cunning,

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,830
possessing demonic powers.

72
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,230
They're very dangerous.

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
I have to risk my life doing this job.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,270
Do you think this small amount of money

75
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,000
is worth me risking my life for?

76
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,409
But weren't youâ€¦

77
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,430
That was because

78
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,820
Lord Geng from the Guangping Government

79
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,080
personally invited me

80
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,240
to help capture

81
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,270
the throat-slicing bandit.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,460
The reward was very generous.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,510
It was different from your case.

84
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,370
Aren't you a demon hunter? You...

85
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,920
Demon hunters are still humans.

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
We also need to make a living,

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,690
don't we?

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,280
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,070
I can't help you with this.

90
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,930
You should look for someone else.

91
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,920
Wait a moment.

92
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,200
I'll give you the money.

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,930
Name your price, and I'll try to gather it.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,950
Didn't I already tell you?

95
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,480
I have something to do and can't leave for now.

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,420
You clearly don't want to help me.

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,600
Chi Xue!

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,600
See them out.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,060
Coming.

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
This way, please.

101
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,720
Alright, stop looking.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,260
Where's the sound eel?

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,310
How did it escape?

104
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,170
How did I not notice?

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,690
Didn't you know the sound eel escaped?

106
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,950
Where are you going to find it?

107
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,600
The bait has already been set.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,730
Is it hard to find it?

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,610
Physician Jiu, you're in quite a mood.

110
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,950
You just got home,

111
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,600
and now you're heading out again.

112
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,130
Don't tell me you're off to hunt demons again.

113
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,360
My Lady,

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,300
don't be discouraged.

115
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,920
Guangping is so big.

116
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,000
He's definitely not the only demon hunter here.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,190
Let's search slowly,

118
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,590
and we'll surely find someone capable of saving your father.

119
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,770
[For Rent]

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,830
It's just a few words.

121
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,930
It won't take up too much

122
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,810
of your time.

123
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,650
Where did that villain go?

124
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,750
His behavior was suspicious,

125
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,870
and he attacked the officials.

126
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,390
I suspect he's involved in a case

127
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,720
and want to capture him for questioning.

128
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,380
He ran away.

129
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,320
He ran away?

130
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,870
Physician Jiu, why did I hear that

131
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,260
it was you who dragged him away?

132
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,840
It's been so long.

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,190
Have you gotten anything out of him?

134
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,460
What's his background?

135
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,310
What's his connection

136
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,710
to that throat-slitter?

137
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,190
Chief Constable Chu,

138
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,920
haven't you

139
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,830
always thought

140
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,760
I was a murderer?

141
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,950
Then why did you ask me?

142
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,410
Investigate it yourself.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,670
Jiu Xuanye,

144
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,830
don't think that just because you saved my life,

145
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,230
I'll let you off the hook.

146
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,630
Chief Chu.

147
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Chief Chu,

148
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,520
His Lordship is looking for you.

149
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,630
Xuanye,

150
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,990
you're angry.

151
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,840
You are angry.

152
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,640
We've already wasted too much time.

153
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,400
We must find

154
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,750
Duan Banxia as soon as possible.

155
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,600
We can't let the sound eel

156
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,530
get there first.

157
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,260
We are catching the sound eel.

158
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,190
Why should we look for Duan Banxia?

159
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,750
Besides, didn't you

160
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,880
just drive her away?

161
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,270
I see.

162
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,830
You regret it.

163
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,550
You want to apologize to her.

164
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,190
Who caught the Human-faced Owl?

165
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:15,870
You.

166
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,240
And who else?

167
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,040
Me.

168
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,690
And Manniang.

169
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,420
Oh, right.

170
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,360
The sound eel is a companion demon of the Human-faced Owl.

171
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,370
Now that the Human-faced Owl is dead,

172
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,500
he will naturally seek revenge for it.

173
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,100
But he can't beat you,

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,080
so he'll go after

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,280
Duan Banxia instead.

176
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,900
You finally get it.

177
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,120
Then why did you drive her away?

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,120
If she hadn't left,

179
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
would the sound eel show itself?

180
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,790
Indeed.

181
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,720
There aren't many inns in the city.

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,180
Let's split up and search.

183
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,780
Let's split up and search.

184
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,550
Be careful, Miss.

185
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,650
This corridor

186
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,870
connects the front and back courtyards.

187
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,870
The yard is spacious,

188
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,870
with a pleasant view,

189
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,730
and there are several side rooms.

190
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,330
If your family is large,

191
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,600
there's plenty of space for everyone.

192
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
Let me show you this room.

193
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,210
Be careful.

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Come.

195
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,580
Come in and have a look.

196
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,670
How's this?

197
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,550
This side room is big, isn't it?

198
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,360
Sir,

199
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,390
you call this good business?

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
Let's be frank.

201
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,150
This shop is indeed not bad,

202
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,260
but there's dust everywhere.

203
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,860
It doesn't seem like it's been regularly used.

204
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,070
Is there something wrong with it?

205
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,670
No, no, no.

206
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,340
How could there be a problem?

207
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
Didn't I tell you?

208
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,980
This shop is about to close down.

209
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,490
So

210
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,790
we haven't stayed here for a while.

211
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,480
That's why there's a bit of dust.

212
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,950
Sir,

213
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,360
are you familiar with the owner

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,120
of the pharmacy next door?

215
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,670
No.

216
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,320
Not at all.

217
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,960
Because we each mind

218
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,320
our own business.

219
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
We have never interacted.

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,750
What's wrong, Miss?

221
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,390
Did you hear

222
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,150
some rumors?

223
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,600
You mustn't believe them.

224
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,510
They're all nonsense,

225
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,630
completely unfounded.

226
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,150

Alright, alright, I'll go get them right away.

Well, ladies,

please make yourselves at home.

I'll take my leave now.

235
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,600
My Lady,

236
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,350
we're already short on money.

237
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,790
Why did you rent a shop?

238
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,750
Wouldn't it be better to just stay at an inn?

239
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,290
What were you thinking?

240
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,910
Do you think he refused to help us

241
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,510
just because

242
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,790
he wants money?

243
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,000
Then why is it?

244
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,120
If it were really about money,

245
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,600
he could have just given us

246
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
a specific number, right?

247
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
Besides, my family isn't poor,

248
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
and he knows that.

249
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,930
From my interactions with him before,

250
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,600
I don't think

251
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
he's a person who's driven by money.

252
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,480
You've only known him for a few days.

253
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
What could you possibly see?

254
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,270
Anyway, I feel like

255
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,670
there's another reason.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
Could it be

257
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
that he thinks this matter

258
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,340
is too tricky,

259
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,720
and he can't handle it,

260
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,980
so he's not helping us?

261
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
That's possible.

262
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,200
So what should we do now?

263
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's write a letter to Yuanzhou

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,730
and have them send us the money.

265
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,290
Aren't you going to write to Young Master?

266
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,390
If my brother finds out

267
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm here,

268
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,570
he'll come

269
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,120
and drag me back right away.

270
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,030
Nanyang is not far from Yuanzhou.

271
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,390
If you send a letter home,

272
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,790
Young Master will find out sooner or later.

273
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Let's just delay it as long as we can.

274
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,490
And then?

275
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,210
Then we'll find out

276
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,200
why he's not helping us.

have you found her?

No.

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,550

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,380
but I couldn't find Manniang.

Do you think

285
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,690
she might have been eaten by the sound eel?

and had nowhere to stay.

296
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,820
I found the inns too noisy,

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,750
and jewelry she was wearing

383
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,079
were all Madam Zhang's.

384
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:38,610
[Guangping Government]

385
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,210
My Lord.

386
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,980
What's the situation?

387
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,670
When we arrived,

388
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,960
Madam Zhang had already disappeared.

389
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,830
According to the servants in the residence,

390
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,480
a few days ago,

391
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
Madam Zhang suddenly appeared radiant,

392
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
as if she had become

393
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,900
ten years younger overnight.

394
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
The servants were surprised,

395
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,110
but they all assumed she had used

396
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,440
some sort of beauty remedy,

397
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,900
so they didn't make a fuss.

398
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,440
Last night, Zhang Residence

399
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,510
hosted guests, and during the banquet,

400
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,720
Madam Zhang suddenly felt dizzy

401
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
and went to her room to rest.

402
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,580
Since then,

403
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,040
she never left the room again.

404
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,630
[Geng Zhen, Prefectural Governor of Guangping]

405
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,430
However, what's strange is that

406
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,350
we found the body of a woman

407
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,980
in her bedroom, appearing to be

408
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,640
in her seventies or eighties.

409
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,350
The deceased was not someone from the residence,

410
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,440
but the clothes and jewelry she was wearing

411
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,770
were all Madam Zhang's.

412
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,550
This situation is a bit suspicious.

413
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,660
Youhuang.

414
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,030
Yes.

415
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
What's your opinion?

416
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,110
I humbly speculate

417
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,920
that someone sneaked into the residence

418
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,310
and abducted Madam Zhang.

419
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,240
As for the body,

420
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,850
I don't have any clues for now.

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,530
Wen Jian,

422
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,250
My Lord.

423
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What do you think?

424
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:42,750
I...

425
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,240
I completely agree

426
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,500
with Chief Constable Chu's opinion.

427
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,400
Madam Zhang is an official's wife

428
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,330
of noble status.

429
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,640
We must not be careless.

430
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,750
We must investigate thoroughly

431
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,880
and solve the case as soon as possible.

432
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,030
Yes.

433
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,920
It's raining so heavily.

434
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,050
I was planning to go out and take a walk.

435
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,340
My Lady,

436
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,750
I've already sent the letter back.

437
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,880
It will take about 7 to 8 days to arrive.

438
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,150
That means we'll have to wait

439
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,320
at least half a month

440
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,180
to receive the money

441
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,050
sent from home.

442
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,750
How much did you

443
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,830
ask them to send?

444
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,240
Two hundred taels of silver.

445
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,300
Two hundred taels?

446
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,810
Is he worth that much?

447
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,030
Do you think capable demon hunters

448
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,560
are just found everywhere?

449
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,720
Well, we don't know

450
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
if he's really that capable.

451
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,700
But when I first heard you talk about him,

452
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,320
I thought he was an old master

453
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,050
with a white beard.

454
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,370
I didn't expect him to be so young.

455
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
What a heavy rain!

456
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,410
Did you get wet?

457
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,030
No.

458
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,250
Hurry, pay your respects.

459
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,890
[Ji Li, Yunmen Dance Troupe Dancer]
[Xu Zhizhi, Yunmen Dance Troupe Dancer]

460
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Can you accompany me to offer a lamp?

461
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,870
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

462
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,200
-Did you get burned?
-My Lady.

463
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
My Lady, are you alright?

464
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,010
I'm fine.

465
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,660
I got your shoes dirty.

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,730
I'm so sorry.

467
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,070
It's alright.

468
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,520
Thank you for catching me.

469
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,030
Otherwise, I would have fallen.

470
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,690
This lamp

471
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
must stay lit for three days and nights without going out.

472
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,460
If it goes out, it won't be effective.

473
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,860
It went out!

474
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,750
It's okay, it's okay.

475
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
We haven't offered it yet.

476
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
I'll get you another one.

477
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,090
But if it goes out, it won't be effective!

478
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,080
What won't be effective?

479
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,160
Don't you know?

480
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,870
The Bodhisattva at Fa'en Temple is very powerful.

481
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,500
As long as you offer a lamp in front of the Buddha

482
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,310
and keep it lit for three days and nights,

483
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,620
any wish you make

484
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,650
will come true.

485
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,410
Really?

486
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,830
Then I'll go offer one too,

487
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,310
My Lady.

488
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,900
Miss, are you from out of town?

489
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,330
How did you know?

490
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,870
I took a guess.

491
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,640
My name is Xu Zhizhi,

492
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,970
and this is Sister Ji Li.

493
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,070
We're from Yunmen Dance Troupe.

494
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,030
If you have time,

495
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,230
you can come and watch our performance.

496
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,920
Okay.

497
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
What's your name?

498
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
My surname is Duan. I'm Duan Banxia.

499
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,040
What a nice name.

500
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,490
How so?

501
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,530
It just sounds quite full.

502
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,920
Full?

503
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,610
Well, in summer,

504
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,320
there are plenty of fruits and vegetables.

505
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,940
And pears to eat too.

506
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,880
Right.

507
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,400
On our way here,

508
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
we bought some pears.

509
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
Sister Ji Li doesn't like pears.

510
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
It smells so good.

511
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,030
But I can't eat them either.

512
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,240
I want to lose weight.

513
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm offering the lamp to get slimmer.

514
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,920
Next time you see me,

515
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,790
don't fail to recognize me

516
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,990
because I'm thinner.

517
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,480
Xuanye,

518
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,640
it has been so long and they still haven't come out.

519
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Could they have been eaten by the sound eel?

520
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,000
No.

521
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,930
Why?

522
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
Is it because the sound eel believes in Buddhism

523
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,330
and wouldn't kill inside a temple?

524
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,000
There's a snake!

525
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,340
The rain has stopped.

526
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,410
Where do you live?

527
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,350
On Sifang Street, Changping Alley.

528
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,240
I know that area.

529
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,830
There was a murder case there before,

530
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,240
right?

531
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,180
Sister Ji Li, was it there?

532
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,480
I don't know.

533
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,340
You weren't with us back then.

534
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,960
What murder case?

535
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,820
You don't know?

536
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Six years ago,

537
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,400
a murder case happened

538
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,460
in Changping Alley on Sifang Street.

539
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,000
The youngest son of a family

540
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
killed his parents, older brother,

541
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
and even three people

542
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,700
who were working for them.

543
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,310
It was quite a sensation at the time.

544
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,310
Why did he do it?

545
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,360
I heard it was because his parents were biased

546
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,830
and planned to leave all the inheritance to the older son.

547
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,850
So the younger son, in a fit of rage,

548
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,250
killed the whole family.

549
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,340
Since then,

550
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,350
the feng shui there hasn't been good.

551
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,960
No one wants to go there anymore.

552
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,720
Over time,

553
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,480
businesses couldn't run there anymore.

554
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,070
You said the rent was cheap earlier,

555
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,310
and that's the reason.

556
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,640
Which household was it?

557
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,290
I heard it's a pharmacy.

558
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,120
Let's go.

559
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,440
Which pharmacy was it?

560
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,490
I'm not sure about that.

561
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,030
Don't listen to Zhizhi's nonsense.

562
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,000
She's the type of person

563
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,060
who loves to gossip

564
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,640
and listens to street rumors.

565
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,790
Eight out of ten things

566
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,960
she says are false.

567
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,570
Don't take it to heart.

568
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I do not!

569
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,310
I've lived here

570
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,440
for so many years.

571
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,040
How could I be wrong about something so big?

572
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,790
Anyway, if you guys

573
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,830
aren't short on money,

574
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,680
just move out.

575
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,400
Xuanye,

576
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,160
they're talking bad about you.

577
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,760
Let's not help them anymore.

578
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,880
My Lady,

579
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,090
could the person she was talking about

580
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,750
be the demon hunter next door?

581
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,110
His Ganshan Clinic

582
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,270
is a pharmacy.

583
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,690
I don't think it's him.

584
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,000
It was such a serious crime.

585
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If it were really him,

586
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,060
he would have been arrested long ago.

587
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
That makes sense.

588
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,590
My Lady,

589
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,720
do you know if he has

590
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,680
any relatives?

591
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,880
Isn't the one

592
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,210
who's always by his side

593
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,640
his younger brother?

594
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,850
You mean Chi Xue?

595
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
He's a demon.

596
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,400
A demon?

597
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,030
What kind of demon?

598
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,690
A rabbit demon.

599
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,030
A... a rabbit?

600
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,640
Can a rabbit become a demon?

601
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,030
You didn't know?

602
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,830
You never told me.

603
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,960
But it's not important.

604
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,590
And you don't need to be afraid.

605
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,400
Chi Xue is quite nice, isn't he?

606
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,260
But isn't Physician Jiu

607
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,640
a demon hunter?

608
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,610
Why does he have a demon by his side?

609
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,930
It's so strange.

610
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,660
Maybe demons are divided into good and bad ones.

611
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,040
Ungrateful.

612
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,550
My Lady,

613
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,480
was the rabbit demon

614
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,680
talking about us?

615
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,880
What murder case?

616
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,650
Don't you know?

617
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Six years ago,

618
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,000
a murder case happened

619
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,060
in Changping Alley on Sifang Street.

620
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,590
The youngest son of a family

621
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,810
killed his parents, older brother,

622
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
and even three people

623
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,420
who were working for them.

624
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It was quite a sensation at the time.

625
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,880
I don't have any family.

626
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,440
If you come to Guangping,

627
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,350
you can find me at Ganshan Clinic in Changping Alley,

628
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,210
Sifang Street.

629
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,200
Let's do it here.

630
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,850
Xuanye,

631
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,660
this guy is really bad.

632
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,440
Let's just kill him.

633
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,640
Although he was controlled by the Human-faced Owl,

634
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,110
his intelligence has not yet been awakened.

635
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,880
He was just

636
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,080
a weapon

637
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,110
in the Human-faced Owl's hand anyway.

638
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,920
There's no need to completely annihilate him.

639
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,720
We just need to

640
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,180
take his primodal spirit.

641
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,450
Alright.

642
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,880
Step back a bit more.

643
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,220
The Moon Bugs feed on primordial spirit.

644
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,410
Physician Jiu.

645
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,770
Is something wrong?

646
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,300
I think I caught a cold last night.

647
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,560
I woke up feeling unwell today.

648
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,210
Aren't you a physician?

649
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,770
I rushed over to see you.

650
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,650
Come in.

651
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,640
The soup is boiling.

652
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,530
You're making mutton soup?

653
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,580
Don't touch it.

654
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
That soup isn't for humans.

655
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,320
Come here.

656
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,610
The other hand.

657
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,610
What's this?

658
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,170
There's nothing seriously wrong with your body.

659
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,970
Just go home and have a good rest.

660
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,590
Don't you need to prescribe any medicine?

661
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,160
No need.

662
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,170
If you're still worried,

663
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:33,810
you can go home

664
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,240
and have some ginger water

665
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,100
to sweat it out.

666
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,560
Okay.

667
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,810
Thank you, Physician Jiu.

668
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,250
Is there anything else?

669
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,090
Chi Xue isn't here?

670
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,120
What do you need Chi Xue for?

671
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,420
I just moved here,

672
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,110
and there isn't much in my house.

673
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,830
I want to buy some things from the street,

674
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,310
but I'm afraid I won't be able to carry everything back,

675
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,840
so I want to ask him for help.

676
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,270
Chi Xue is a demon.

677
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,670
I know. A rabbit demon.

678
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,130
I've seen it.

679
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,060
You're not afraid?

680
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,800
He's one of your people.

681
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,200
So he must be a good demon.

682
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,160
Xuanye,

683
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,280
did you hear

684
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,310
Tingzhou and me talking yesterday?

685
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
We really didn't mean to.

686
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,100
We just heard others discussing it,

687
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,840
so we talked about it for a little while.

688
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,320
I know

689
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,110
the one they were talking about definitely wasn't you.

690
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,510
I...

691
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,590
It was me.

692
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,640
I was the one

693
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,960
who killed my parents, older brother,

694
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,220
and the three workers.

695
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
You don't believe it?

696
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,200
I don't believe it.

697
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,460
If it really were you,

698
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,180
you would've been arrested by the government office long ago.

699
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,720
Maybe I

700
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,060
bribed the officials

701
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,460
to avoid being caught.

702
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,080
It was such a big case.

703
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,400
Not to mention whether you could

704
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
pay to cover it up,

705
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,850
even if it really was you who did it,

706
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,220
as you said,

707
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,270
I believe you must have

708
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,270
your own reasons.

709
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,850
Just like my father's disappearance.

710
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,750
Everyone says he's dead,

711
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,940
but I know he's not.

712
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,070
This world

713
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,310
isn't always what it

714
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,350
appears to be.

715
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,270
Many things

716
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,400
cannot be understood by common sense.

717
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,400
Also,

718
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,300
when I first met you,

719
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,920
I felt you were a good person,

720
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,490
a person who strangely made me want to believe in you.

721
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,320
So I believe

722
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,010
you wouldn't do anything bad.

723
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,840
Where are you going?

724
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,630
Why are you following me?

725
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,690
I haven't finished what I was saying.

726
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,679
What else do you want to say?

727
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,840
Well,

728
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,550
last time you said you charge

729
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,610
for your services.

730
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,710
But you never mentioned

731
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,940
how much.

732
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,920
And you've been to

733
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,880
my grandmother's residence.

734
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,230
It's not an ordinary household.

735
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,760
As long as you're willing to go back to Nanyang with me

736
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,590
and find my father,

737
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,719
I can give you as much money as you want.

738
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,080
Is that so?

739
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,699
Yes.

740
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,650
And didn't you say that

741
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,550
I have the ability to see demons?

742
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,360
This is a one-in-ten-thousand gift.

743
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,690
I can help you.

744
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,889
It'll definitely make things easier.

745
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,560
You help me?

746
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,760
Have you been to Guangping before?

747
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,420
Yes, I have.

748
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,070
When I was little,

749
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,730
my father worked at the government office

750
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,560
in Guangping.

751
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,460
We moved away

752
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,810
after my mother passed.

753
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
So you're quite familiar with Guangping.

754
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,010
Not really.

755
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,760
It was when I was a kid.

756
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,510
That's perfect.

757
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,110
You can take a closer look now.

758
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,480
Come.

759
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,840
Guangping has been the capital for three dynasties.

760
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,400
People have been living here

761
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,230
since the Shang and Zhou dynasties,

762
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,160
and it has been thousands of years.

763
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,000
It really is bustling.

764
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,880
Yes,

765
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,740
it really is bustling.

766
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,030
Didn't you say

768
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,190
Come,

770
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,360
Tell me which ones are humans

771
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,760
and which ones are demons

772
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,400
on this street. Are you okay?

773
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,310
Help!

774
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,440

775

777

[This area is dangerous Civilians are forbidden to enter]

Are you alright?

781
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
This area is off-limits.

782
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,960
Why are you here?

783
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
I saw there weren't many people here,

784
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,200
so I thought I'd come to catch some fish.

785
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,460
Catch fish?

786
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,190
Do you know

787
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,790
how dangerous this place is?

788
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,370
This river connects to the Underground City,

789
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,760
where humans and demons are mixed together.

790
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,070
It's extremely dangerous.

791
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,980
If you had been swept into

792
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,400
the Underground City by the river just now

793
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,600
and caught by demons,

794
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,880
you'd never have come back.

795
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,800
Kind sir, you're lying.

796
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,850
Our teacher said

797
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,680
there are no demons in the world.

798
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,520
That's because

799
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,230
your teacher

800
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,490
has never seen a demon.

801
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,670
Our teacher is well-learned and knowledgeable.

802
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,840
He can't be wrong.

803
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,210
You believe your teacher, huh?

804
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:35,880
Fine.

805
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,560
Let's go.

806
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,670
I'll take you to see for yourselves.

807
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:38,920
No!

808
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,510
No, no, no!

809
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,690
Scared now, aren't you?

810
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,190
Then don't come to

811
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,880
this place again.

812
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,400
Got it?

813
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

814
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,680
Alright.

815
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,580
Go back now.

816
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,090
Thank you, kind sir.

817
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,900
Why did you follow me here?

818
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,840
Was what you just told those children true,

819
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,500
or were you just lying to them?

820
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,360
Do you know

821
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,030
what the Underground City is like?

822
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,960
The Underground City

823
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,510
is an isolated city,

824
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,650
discovered over a hundred years ago.

825
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,590
No one knows who built it

826
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,160
or when

827
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,110
it was built.

828
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,380
That place is remote and hard to find,

829
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,620
which is why many businesses,

830
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,400
including some

831
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,730
shady dealings,

832
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,310
are conducted there.

833
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,960
As you just heard,

834
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,590
the Underground City is a mix of humans and demons,

835
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,990
and it's very dangerous.

836
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,720
You've been talking about your father,

837
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,220
but that's just

838
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,480
your side of the story.

839
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,840
Whether there are demons causing trouble,

840
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,860
or it's just that you can't accept

841
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,510
the fact that your loved one is gone,

842
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,490
I'm not sure yet.

843
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,170
My father must still be alive.

844
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,630
If your father is in the Underground City,

845
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,090
would you dare to go there?

846
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,270
Why wouldn't I dare?

847
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,550
No matter what danger there is,

848
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,080
I must

849
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
rescue my father.

850
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,760
If you're willing to help me,

851
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,020
that would be the best.

852
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,580
If not,

853
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,880
I can't force you.

854
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,760
How about this?

855
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,690
Name your price.

856
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,740
You talk like you're really rich.

857
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,510
I really am rich.

858
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,310
Do you have a thousand taels?

859
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,710
I do.

860
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,280
Really?

861
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,710
Really.

862
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,330
Alright, give it to me.

863
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,710
How can that work?

864
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,020
You haven't signed the contract yet.

865
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,520
I never sign contracts.

866
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,710
If you have it, give it to me;

867
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,040
if not, let's part ways.

868
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,760
Don't be in such a rush.

869

all the time?

872
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,880

873
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,410
and haven't even had breakfast.

874
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,320
Let's go grab something to eat first.

875

879
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,020

We've never been here before.

888
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,400
Waiter, what do you recommend?

889
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,070
We have three signature dishes:

890
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,460
roasted camel hump, grilled lamb, and stewed bass.

891
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,920
What would you like to eat?

892
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,840
We'll have one of each,

893
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,480
and a pepper flatbread.

894
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,460
Certainly.

895
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,960
You're quite the spendthrift.

I'm just treating an important guest.

897

If so,
