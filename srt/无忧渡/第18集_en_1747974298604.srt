00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,560
Winter

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

3
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,720
little bit of a

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,680
little bit of a

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,320
little bit of a

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,320
little bit of a

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
little bit of a

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
little bit of a

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
little bit of a

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
little bit of a

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,320
little bit of a

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
little bit of a

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
little bit of a

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
little bit of a

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
little bit of a

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
little bit of a

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,320
little bit of a

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
little bit of a

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
little bit of a

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
little bit of a

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
little bit of a

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
little bit of a

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
little bit of a

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
little bit of a

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,320
little bit of a

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,320
little bit of a

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
little bit of a

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
little bit of a

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
little bit of a

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
little bit of a

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
little bit of a

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
little bit of a

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
little bit of a

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
little bit of a

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
little bit of a

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
little bit of a

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
little bit of a

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
little bit of a

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
little bit of a

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
little bit of a

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
little bit of a

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
little bit of a

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
little bit of a

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
little bit of a

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
little bit of a

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
little bit of a

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,320
better

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
I was in Guangping when my brother was killed by a bad luck.

50
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Because you were in danger and you were in danger.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
But it was not easy to solve the case.

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,320
After that, I went to Shendu and then I took the case down.

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,320
When I went back to Guangping to find you, you had already left.

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I was upset and left.

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I went back to Guangping after half a year.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,320
It was thanks to my uncle that I survived.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
I wanted to find a chance to thank you in person.

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
But I couldn't find you for a long time.

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,320
I didn't expect to see you again today. It's fate.

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Yunyi, we are not that close.

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Actually, I owe more to your father than gratitude.

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,320
I heard from my father that he had a junior brother.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,320
He was talented and brilliant.

64
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,320
But he was sentenced to death and he didn't see him again.

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Yes.

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,320
I thought I had a chance to see him again when I was young.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,320
But I didn't expect to see him again.

68
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Why was your uncle sentenced to death?

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Because we have different ideas.

70
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,320
When I was two years old, I went hiking.

71
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,320
I went to Nanguo Town and met a girl.

72
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I fell in love with her at first sight and couldn't let go of her.

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
She liked me very much.

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,320
We promised to be together forever.

75
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,320
But soon I found out that she was not a person.

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,320
She was a fox.

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I struggled for a long time but I still couldn't let her go.

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,320
But you know that I'm a member of the Bajumen.

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
The Bajumen's rules are strict.

80
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
The first rule is to keep a distance from the demon.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
You can't be angry with the demon.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
After Master found out, he was furious.

83
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
He ordered me to break off the relationship with him.

84
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
But I couldn't do it.

85
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,320
So I had to say goodbye to Master and Senior Brother.

86
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
After that, I went to the temple with my sister.

87
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,320
I went to the temple with my sister.

88
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,320
After that? Are you still together?

89
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm here.

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Why?

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
She left.

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
She left?

93
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Although she was loyal to me, she was still a demon.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
After she was drunk, she was obsessed with love.

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
She almost got hurt by me.

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,320
After that, she left.

97
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
You didn't go to find her?

98
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I did.

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
But I couldn't find her.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,320
So I came to the underground city.

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
There were many demons here.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
There were many demons.

103
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
I thought we would meet one day.

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
But it's been 20 years.

105
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
She never showed up.

106
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
How could this happen?

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
There are different demons.

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Compared to other places,

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
we are much better.

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Are there any exceptions?

111
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Maybe.

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
But I don't know.

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Master.

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Why did you ask me to come here?

115
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Nothing.

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm just curious.

117
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Why did you come here?

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Why did you come to the temple?

119
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,320
King Xianan is a great artist.

120
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Every time he goes to a place,

121
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,320
he goes to the temple to visit.

122
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,320
We have no clue.

123
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
We are just a bunch of people.

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Where are we going now?

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Now...

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Do you want to find someone?

127
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
No.

128
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,320
How do you know we are looking for someone?

129
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm a night watchman.

130
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I know it by reading the paper.

131
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
It's not a sunny day.

132
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Why do you need a night watchman?

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Young people are so cunning.

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
You might not find a wife.

135
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I didn't say that.

136
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
How do I know it's not important?

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,320
What's important is that I can help you find someone you want to meet.

138
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
How?

139
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,320
This is a spiritual object called the immortal paper.

140
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Isn't this a silk man?

141
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Yes.

142
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Although the two have the same appearance,

143
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,320
they have different functions.

144
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,320
The south means north and south.

145
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
The direction changes.

146
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,320
The immortal paper can point to the person you want.

147
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Believe me,

148
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
as long as you succeed,

149
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,320
this will find the person you want.

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Have you seen this person before?

151
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Yes.

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Write it down.

153
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm sure.

154
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
I want this.

155
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
It's so broad.

156
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,320
So you're here to find your parents?

157
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Yes.

158
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
You're here to help her find her parents?

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Yes.

160
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
You're just an ordinary friend.

161
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
This has something to do with the demon.

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I can't help her without her help.

163
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Uncle,

164
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,320
I have a favor to ask.

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
What is it?

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I have a favor to ask.

167
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I know.

168
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
You want me to help you find the person who helped you find the book?

169
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Yes.

170
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
You're the master of Xiaodong Tian.

171
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
You're also one of the masters of the underground city.

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
This is your territory.

173
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
You must be familiar with it.

174
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
If you can help me,

175
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'll be very grateful.

176
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Bai Xunyu, don't be so proud of me.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
What master?

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
You'll know when you stay here for a long time.

179
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
The water is deep here.

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Many people don't dare to go to find me.

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
But Xunyu,

182
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'll help you.

183
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Thank you, uncle.

184
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Chunmian,

185
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,320
go find a shop called Tianhu Bookstore.

186
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Report to me when you find it.

187
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Yes.

188
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Thank you, master.

189
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
You can't call me master anymore.

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
You should call me uncle like him.

191
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Please enjoy, Mr. Fan.

192
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Thank you.

193
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Be careful not to get burned.

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Is it good?

195
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
I've been hungry these days.

196
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I've been in Danding Shopa and haven't had a good meal.

197
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
After the two magicians brought you in,

198
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
they left you in the inn.

199
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Yes.

200
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I told them I wanted to go out with them.

201
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
They didn't let me.

202
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Most importantly,

203
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
he kept asking me about you and Chi Shui.

204
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I said I was not familiar with you.

205
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
He changed his attitude completely.

206
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
He kept spending my money and my ticket.

207
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Didn't you say

208
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
there was only a little misunderstanding between you?

209
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Is it a good relationship?

210
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
You must be full after eating so little.

211
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
I'll go over there and buy you something to eat.

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Boss, I want a portion of wonton.

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Okay.

214
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
The second one.

215
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Here you are.

216
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Your wonton.

217
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
I don't want it.

218
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
He's gone.

219
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
It's okay.

220
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Good morning, boss.

221
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,320
My boss asked me to bring you a message.

222
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
He found the Tihu Bookstore.

223
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Look, the best.

224
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Come and have a look.

225
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Look, they're all good.

226
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Look at this.

227
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Look at this.

228
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Boss, look at this.

229
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
I don't want it.

230
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Banxia, it's here.

231
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
It's so hidden.

232
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
No wonder I can't find it.

233
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Lv Chunmian said this is a ghost shop.

234
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Ghost shop?

235
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes, a shop for ghosts.

236
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Ghosts can open shops?

237
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
It's okay here.

238
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
As long as it doesn't harm people or reveal my true identity,

239
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,320
no one will be in charge of it.

240
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Shixuan, you don't have to wait.

241
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Banxia, let's go in and have a look.

242
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
This way, please.

243
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Okay.

244
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Do you want to buy paintings?

245
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
We can take a look.

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Okay, please come in.

247
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
This way, please.

248
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Okay, please.

249
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
This way, please.

250
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
This way, please.

251
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
This way, please.

252
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
This way, please.

253
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
This way, please.

254
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
This way, please.

255
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
This way, please.

256
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
This way, please.

257
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
This way, please.

258
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
This way, please.

259
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
This way, please.

260
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
This way, please.

261
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
This way, please.

262
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Are you thirsty?

263
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm Matan, the owner of Tilhu Bookstore.

264
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Are both of you here to buy paintings?

265
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:08,560
Love means not saving others' love But protecting our則 joining our young life

266
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,340
Are you here to interfere me?

267
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,600
I... I...

268
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,740
Please come in, please come in!

269
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
Please have a look.

270
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,560
This is the opening of our store.

271
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,520
Special documents,

272
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,440
security documents,

273
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,280
security documents,

274
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,960
and rent documents.

275
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,720
And of course,

276
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,120
this is the signboard of the best store

277
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,840
in the underground city.

278
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Please have a look.

279
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,920
Since the opening of our store,

280
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,600
we've been quiet and quiet.

281
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,080
We've never been in the same room

282
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
with a guest.

283
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,720
We're always fighting.

284
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,560
It's not difficult.

285
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,880
As a person,

286
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,960
it's already meaningless to open a store here.

287
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,680
We have to be watched by others every day.

288
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,760
And we have to be asked by the officials.

289
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,440
To be honest,

290
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,720
the people who come to my store

291
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,920
are more than the guests.

292
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,360
We're not here to check the store.

293
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
You're not here to check the store?

294
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,200
Then who are you?

295
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,320
We're here to find someone.

296
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,640
Find someone?

297
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,360
Then tell me earlier.

298
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,800
The store often helps others

299
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,040
to find people.

300
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
The quality is guaranteed.

301
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Please tell me

302
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
the appearance characteristics

303
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,640
and the day of disappearance

304
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,200
of the person you're looking for.

305
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
The person you're looking for

306
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,800
and the day of disappearance

307
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,440
of the person you're looking for.

308
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,800
What color is the clothes?

309
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,840
Don't bother.

310
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,520
We have clues.

311
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,960
We just need to ask you something.

312
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,440
I don't usually go out.

313
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,400
You may not know what you're asking.

314
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,640
But since you're here,

315
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,680
why don't you tell me?

316
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,560
Maybe I can help you

317
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,720
with something.

318
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,080
My mother, Tang Ruoyun,

319
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,800
disappeared 12 years ago.

320
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,480
So that's why

321
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,840
I came to the underground city.

322
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,240
That's the reason.

323
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,560
That's the reason.

324
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,080
Do you have

325
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,560
my parents' clues?

326
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,520
No.

327
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,400
Then what are you doing?

328
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm just

329
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,920
sad for you.

330
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,760
What a nice girl.

331
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,960
How can she have

332
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,760
such a wonderful life?

333
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,920
Although I can't help you,

334
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,520
I can't let you

335
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
come to the store for nothing.

336
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
Can you

337
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,760
let me

338
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,040
take that letter?

339
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,440
Sure!

340
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,600
Song Xiang Mo is from my store.

341
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,640
But the customers who come to my store often ask me to borrow this Mo Bao.

342
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
They can't find any clues.

343
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,080
The seal looks like it's from my store.

344
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
Please come with me.

345
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,560
Please check if you have the seal you want.

346
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,920
Here.

347
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
Here.

348
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,040
So you don't know Tang Ruoyun.

349
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,040
And you haven't seen this letter.

350
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
Can you give us any clues?

351
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,800
No.

352
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,320
But I can ask someone to inquire about it.

353
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
They said I've lived in this underground city for decades.

354
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
I know many people.

355
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,440
But can you tell me where you live?

356
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,800
If you have any news, I can tell you right away.

357
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,600
I live in Wugong Inn.

358
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,680
Thank you for your help.

359
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,840
It's okay.

360
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,280
Come again.

361
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
If you have nothing to say, you can come to see the painting.

362
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,720
See them off.

363
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,400
Yes.

364
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,840
Please.

365
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Go.

366
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,520
They are gone?

367
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,960
Yes.

368
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,800
Gone?

369
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes.

370
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,560
Bring me the hammer.

371
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,480
Yes.

372
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
Come.

373
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,200
Raise your head.

374
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
No eyes.

375
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,360
They are gone.

376
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,200
No eyes.

377
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
No eyes.

378
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
No eyes.

379
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,040
I've got one.

380
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
This is a waste.

381
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,160
You still want to paint?

382
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,280
You're useless.

383
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
Go back.

384
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Go back.

385
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
Your mother has been missing for more than ten years.

386
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,640
It's not easy to find her.

387
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
It's not a big deal.

388
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,920
Don't be angry.

389
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,640
Miss, I have a spirit here.

390
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
A spirit of immortality.

391
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,840
Miss, as long as you hold it,

392
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,360
you can see the person you want to see most.

393
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,200
Then it will point you to the direction.

394
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
So magical.

395
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
Of course.

396
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
I think you are kind.

397
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,560
It's all for your good.

398
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,040
I'll sell you fifty taels of money.

399
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,800
No.

400
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,120
The lowest magic of the fixed number.

401
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,000
It's not worth a single tael of silver in Guangping.

402
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,800
It's easy to make a city and hard to make a capital.

403
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
One thousand is good enough.

404
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,120
What's wrong with you, Xiaoyu?

405
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,560
You don't know what you see.

406
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
You're selling it to my friend.

407
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
I can't expose you.

408
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,560
It's a good thing.

409
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Maybe you are lucky.

410
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,560
You can see one thousandth of the probability.

411
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
Miss, you can buy it.

412
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
You can find it.

413
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
What's that?

414
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
Miss, you are so good.

415
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,680
It's the deep-rooted dragonfly of Penglai.

416
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,120
It's been ten years since the first dragonfly of Penglai.

417
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
If you are sincere...

418
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
Wei Yingluo.

419
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,240
You can keep its voice for a long time.

420
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,560
How much is it?

421
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,680
I want this.

422
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
You want this?

423
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,480
Okay, I'm leaving.

424
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,840
Here.

425
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
It's too little.

426
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,400
This...

427
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
This is enough.

428
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
Excuse me.

429
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,080
You are so kind.

430
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,600
It's so hard for my old man to do business.

431
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,280
Let's go.

432
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,800
Miss.

433
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Miss.

434
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,280
Where did it go?

435
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
It's all because of Chi Xue.

436
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
Chi Xue?

437
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,200
He is a lazy bug.

438
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
He sleeps when he is full.

439
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,480
He doesn't want me to hold him back.

440
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,680
You are not afraid of him?

441
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,440
What's there to be afraid of?

442
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,520
He is a rabbit.

443
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,200
He is fat and round.

444
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
He is not like Xu Xuanzang.

445
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
He is not like Xu Xuanzang.

446
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
You are pretending to sleep.

447
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,600
You are so capable to let a little girl hold you back.

448
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,960
I am just teasing her.

449
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
There are many types of men and women in the world.

450
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,280
You think you are teasing her.

451
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,480
But if others know it, they will think you are teasing her.

452
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,640
You are not listening?

453
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,680
Yes.

454
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,720
You are allowed to be a partner with Banxia.

455
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
You don't allow me to joke with Tianzhou.

456
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,920
Why should I?

457
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,520
What are you talking about?

458
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
You like it.

459
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
You don't like it.

460
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,680
Even the little girl is happier than you.

461
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
Miss.

462
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,240
Don't worry.

463
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
Doctor Zhou must like you.

464
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
Isn't it obvious?

465
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
He came after us as soon as we left.

466
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
You didn't even notice.

467
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,160
He came after us.

468
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,360
You didn't pay him.

469
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
Why did he help you?

470
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
When he is rescued,

471
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,200
he will go to the Li family to return the money.

472
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,160
You are so filial.

473
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,600
He will listen to you.

474
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,120
Then there will be nothing in your way.

475
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,640
Chenyin.

476
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
You and Banxia are going to be a family.

477
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,840
Don't be so sure.

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,720
Xuanye.

479
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
I don't like your uncle.

480
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
He has a bad smell.

481
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
What smell?

482
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,160
He doesn't like my smell.

483
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,960
He has been living in the underground city.

484
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080
He must have a milder attitude towards medicine than me.

485
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,200
Really?

486
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,320
Xuanye.

487
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
I just heard Banxia and Tingzhu talking.

488
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,720
They said they will go to the Fu family to return the money

489
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,320
and marry you after they find their father.

490
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
They like it.

491
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,680
They don't like it.

492
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Even the little girl is happier than you.

493
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,880
Xuanye.

494
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,720
Where are you going?

495
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
I am going to the hospital.

496
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,080
anga.

497
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
You always come back so fast.

498
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
You have been here for such a long time.

499
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
Are you sleepy?

500
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,160
Go back and sleep later.

501
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,600
It's OK.

502
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,600
Can't you sleep?

503
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
I can stay along with you.

504
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
Necessary.

505
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
I am sleepy now.

506
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,880
I must go back to sleep now.

507
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,080
Sit down.

508
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,720
If critic was éclairs to owner about him,

509
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,780
you would not be able change into that character now.

510
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:35,880
I already experienced hay fever and heart

511
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,080
Dad, how will you treat me?

512
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Continue to be friends or pretend not to know

513
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,480
Or will you kill me

514
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,880
You are a person, this fake thing has no meaning

515
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,680
Why is it meaningless?

516
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,480
You just say it

517
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,480
If I were a demon, would you hit me?

518
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,280
Of course not

519
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,280
I will take you back and tie you up

520
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
You can pretend in front of me for so long, I didn't even find it

521
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
You must be a demon who is good at pretending

522
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Worth taking back to study

523
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Anyway, if you are a demon, I will not care

524
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,280
It's late at night, do you know?

525
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
No one can save you this time

526
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
I see where you can go

527
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Big brother, second brother

528
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
I am here

529
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I am here

530
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
I am here

531
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
I am here

532
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
I am here

533
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Tihu Bookstore, brother

534
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Finally found it

535
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
But it looks like it wants to sell wine

536
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Come

537
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Tihu Bookstore

538
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
What's wrong with the waist?

539
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,280
You can't kill the waist, and it helped me

540
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
I am fine

541
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Who are you?

542
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Why do you help me?

543
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,280
The one who hurt you is a group of demon hunters

544
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
How do you know?

545
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Why do they chase you?

546
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
The main thing is to kill the demon

547
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
It's normal

548
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
You may have to hide for a while

549
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
They found my home

550
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,280
Have you ever thought about leaving the underground city?

551
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
With me now

552
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Isn't it better to go out?

553
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
I don't know

554
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
I'll take you to a place

555
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Go

556
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Thank you, Dongzhu

557
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Wenyi, do you know this person?

558
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
I met him once

559
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Then why did you help him?

560
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
I shouldn't die

561
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I thought you would be very biased

562
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
About what happened to your sister-in-law

563
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
It's good

564
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Your father will be happy if he is in heaven

565
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
By the way, Xuanye

566
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
How is it going?

567
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
How is the investigation going on Tihu Bookstore?

568
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
No clues yet

569
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Don't worry

570
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I will help you

571
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Thank you, uncle

572
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
You're welcome

573
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I made tea for you

574
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Come

575
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Ok

576
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
It's a big circle

577
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
It's still a self-drawing machine

578
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
I'll buy it after paying the money

579
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Look ahead

580
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
What's wrong?

581
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Why did you go back?

582
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
What kind of crap is this?

583
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
It shouldn't be

584
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Why do you keep following me?

585
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Are you fooled now?

586
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Forget it

587
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
It's better to ask God than to ask soldiers

588
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
You can check it yourself

589
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
How?

590
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
This underground city is not an illegal place

591
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
They dare not to be against officials

592
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
It's an old method

593
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Check it separately

594
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
This is for you

595
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
What's the reason?

596
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
What's the reason?

597
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
What's the reason?

598
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Anyone?

599
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Anyone?

600
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Anyone?

601
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Shopkeeper

602
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Come

603
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Come

604
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Come

605
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Come

606
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Come

607
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Come

608
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Sir, a guest is here

609
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
A guest?

610
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Aren't you the shopkeeper who took care of the books?

611
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
You are so smart

612
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
I am so smart

613
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Please sit

614
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
You are here today

615
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Last time I heard about your accident

616
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I was very sad

617
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
So I asked my friends

618
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Finally I have a good idea

619
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
I found the person you are looking for

620
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Look, is this his notebook?

621
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
This is my father's handwriting

622
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Then come with me

623
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Now?

624
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Yes

625
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
But the people who are with me haven't come back yet

626
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
We can't afford to delay it

627
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Next time I don't know when

628
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
I can meet such a good opportunity

629
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
I'm afraid I can't find the person you are looking for

630
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Girl

631
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
What are you thinking?

632
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
They are all here

633
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Let's take a breath

634
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
I don't know where my father is now

635
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Is my mother here?

636
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I am dragging her

637
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
She is in the shop

638
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
If we don't go there now, she might run away

639
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Let's go

640
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
In the shop?

641
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Girl

642
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Are you going or not?

643
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
I am going

644
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Wait for me to change

645
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Ok, ok, ok

646
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
I will wait for you outside

647
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Come

648
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Waiter

649
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Girl, it's too late

650
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
I

651
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
You

652
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Do you think you can run away?

653
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
I am going

654
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Banxia

655
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
We are coming in

656
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Banxia

657
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Doctor Jiu

658
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Doctor Jiu

659
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Tingzhu, Banxia is not with you?

660
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
No

661
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
I just went to buy the cake

662
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
She is reading here

663
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
What are you doing?

664
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
Kick the fox

665
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,280
I will never forget you

666
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
I will never forget you

667
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
I will never forget you

668
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
I will never forget you

669
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I will never forget you

670
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
I will never forget you

671
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
I will never forget you

672
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
I will never forget you

673
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I will never forget you

674
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
I will never forget you

675
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
I will never forget you

676
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,280
I will never forget you

677
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
I will never forget you

678
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
I will never forget you

679
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,280
I am a carefree person

680
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
How can I leave my heart behind

681
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
and light up the world

682
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
My body is heavy

683
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
I miss you

684
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
I miss you

685
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,280
I miss you

686
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
I miss you

687
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I miss you

688
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
I miss you

689
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I miss you

690
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
I miss you

691
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
I miss you

692
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280

I miss you

695

I miss you

696
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
I miss you

697

I miss you

698
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
I miss you

699
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
