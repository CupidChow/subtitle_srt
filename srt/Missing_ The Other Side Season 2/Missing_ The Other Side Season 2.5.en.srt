Please help me!

if you don't want to die.

(Episode 5)

23
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,389
Who are you?

24
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,409
- What do you mean?
- The phone scammer's murder.

25
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,214
The kidnapping and murder of the woman in the wedding dress.

26
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:21,725
And now, Se Young's abduction too.

27
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,178
You were there every time.

28
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,148
It was part of your plan to approach me, wasn't it?

29
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:29,468
And what if it was?

30
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,468
Why, you...

31
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,938
Look who it is.

32
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,278
It is you.

33
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,308
Right?

34
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:45,298
I almost didn't recognize you with longer hair.

35
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:47,199
Has it been two years?

36
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,789
No.

37
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,239
It was you at the club a few days ago, right?

38
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:04,588
You punk. Darn it!

39
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,319
Are you playing with me?

40
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,558
Hey, Mangchi. Get him.

41
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:41,968
Hey, run.

42
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:44,458
- Get him.
- That little...

43
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,109
Hey, get him!

44
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:50,469
Hey, go that way!

45
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,844
Darn it.

46
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,714
- Shoot.
- Hey, hurry.

47
00:04:57,738 --> 00:04:58,915
Hey!

48
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,289
Hurry up and get him!

49
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,128
Darn it.

50
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,359
- Get him!
- That little...

51
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,348
Hey! You piece of...

52
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,209
Darn it.

53
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,448
Go!

54
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,018
Get him!

55
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,838
- Get up, you idiots!
- Gosh.

56
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,758
Darn it.

57
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,169
Hey, get back here.

58
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:56,304
Wook.

59
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,678
Hey!

60
00:05:58,228 --> 00:05:59,578
Darn you...

61
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,215
- Hey!
- That little...

62
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,545
- Hey!
- Get down.

63
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,609
- You rat!
- Get back here!

64
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,639
- Get down.
- You piece of...

65
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,148
- Hey.
- Come here.

66
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:13,679
Hey, no! Don't do that!

67
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,479
Get that punk!

68
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,888
Hey.

69
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,978
Find him. Hurry up and get him.

70
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,838
Hey, what are you doing?

71
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:12,688
Hey!

72
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,558
Go find him!

73
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:24,899
Wook.

74
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:27,365
Hey, they're gone.

75
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,739
You can come down now.

76
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,838
Darn, I nearly died.

77
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,139
Hey.

78
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:51,009
Who are those jerks? Why did they suddenly show up?

79
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,655
- How would I know?
- Stop lying to my face.

80
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,624
The neighbors may believe you because they're naive,

81
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,225
but I don't.

82
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,194
Why ask if you won't believe me anyway?

83
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:01,568
Shut it! You little...

84
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,804
You admitted yourself...

85
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,958
that approaching me was part of your plan.

86
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,859
Who are you, really?

87
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,475
Who are you that it stinks wherever you go?

88
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,444
That's rich coming from you.

89
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,775
Those people said they would kill you.

90
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,345
Is that why you brought me here?

91
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,845
To hand me over to those jerks?

92
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,855
Do I have to die for all of this to be over?

93
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,478
Oh, it all makes sense now.

94
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,478
You punk. You're with them, aren't you?

95
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,054
- What?
- If...

96
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:30,518
anything bad happens to Se Young, I won't forgive you.

97
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,389
What can I even do in this state?

98
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:35,804
I warned you.

99
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,799
If something happens to that woman, it's all your fault.

100
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,049
Hey.

101
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,369
- Where is Se Young?
- I don't know!

102
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,184
I saw her at that place a few days ago. I haven't seen her since then.

103
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,569
You'd better tell me the truth.

104
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,278
Those jerks who took her. Who are they?

105
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:56,949
- Let go.
- Answer my question!

106
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,808
You little...

107
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,568
Hey, Ko Sang Chul.

108
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,528
Did you not take care of that bar girl?

109
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:14,374
I did.

110
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:16,869
Then what was that thing on the news?

111
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:19,715
Don't you know that her photo was all over the news?

112
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,699
They're saying she's still alive.

113
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,249
She's dead. I took care of her.

114
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:33,099
To tell you the truth,

115
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,469
I lost her in the woods.

116
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,448
After that, I kept looking for her...

117
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,164
and took care of her before the drop-off yesterday.

118
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,034
Then you should've told me!

119
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,658
I took care of her. That's what matters.

120
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,774
I hid it because I was afraid Goliath would ditch me.

121
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,768
I did all the dirty work for six months without meeting Goliath once.

122
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,378
I didn't want to get ditched...

123
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:52,115
for something like this.

124
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,489
You little...

125
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,059
Why, you...

126
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,839
You pathetic idiot.

127
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,555
- Are you sure you took care of her?
- Yes.

128
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,879
Goliath is on edge today because of the shipment.

129
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,918
If that woman went to the police and ran her mouth...

130
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:15,788
Then it would've cost you your life.

131
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,378
Who is the witness?

132
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:22,244
The one who witnessed the wedding dress girl.

133
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,928
Oh Il Yong. You remember him, right?

134
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:25,878
That ghost?

135
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,379
Who is he, really? He witnessed every crime scene?

136
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,128
My point, exactly.

137
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,448
Anyway, okay. Tell me more.

138
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,648
He delivers drugs.

139
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,024
A few days ago, he was delivering drugs...

140
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,894
in Sangak-dong,

141
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,465
and Moon Se Young was in his car.

142
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,158
And someone witnessed it.

143
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,835
That's all I saw.

144
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,668
Then why were you after those drug delivery guys?

145
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,044
For personal reasons.

146
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,044
Then I happened to see the people they had abducted...

147
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,418
and wanted to help them.

148
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:02,849
Are we good now?

149
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,178
Okay, so what are the "personal reasons?"

150
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:12,599
Hey!

151
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:15,079
There is a witness?

152
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:16,628
Who's the witness?

153
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:18,494
I'll tell you later.

154
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:20,688
What? Hey, Detective Oh.

155
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,235
Have we not identified that man yet?

156
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:27,158
No, we should use the photo and put out an APB first.

157
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,668
We have no time to waste, Captain.

158
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:33,168
Darn it. This is nuts.

159
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,185
I'm sure the Drug Squad is after him too.

160
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,855
If we step in, we may end up ruining their investigation.

161
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,914
That's their problem.

162
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:43,879
We must find Moon Se Young as soon as possible.

163
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:46,794
- Right?
- But...

164
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:50,089
Darn it. Man Soo will lash out at me again.

165
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,865
Bo Ra, are you all right?

166
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,404
I heard Bo Ra's dad came by earlier.

167
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:00,404
I saw him. Bo Ra's dad is very handsome.

168
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,644
I'm jealous. My dad just looks like an old man.

169
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:03,945
I'd never let him visit my school.

170
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:06,398
Cho Dan Bi and Nam Eun Ji were scolded in the hallway.

171
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,518
Your friends?

172
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:11,345
Yes.

173
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,339
I'm famous now, thanks to my mom.

174
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,808
Wook and Mr. Jang won't be back until late.

175
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:18,898
Let's go eat something nice.

176
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,628
It's on me.

177
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:23,939
No.

178
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:26,164
I don't even know where my mom is.

179
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:28,548
I'd feel so bad if I went out alone and ate something nice.

180
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:32,028
I'll just go home and watch the news.

181
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,499
If I could, I'd go look for Mom with the police officers.

182
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,398
Do you want to look for her yourself?

183
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,189
Okay, then let's do that.

184
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:02,508
When did you get here?

185
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,229
I'd been calling from way over there and you didn't look.

186
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,168
You looked almost bewitched.

187
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:12,129
I'm well and truly bewitched.

188
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:14,788
Is something up?

189
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,369
Not really.

190
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:19,139
You're just thinking about Hyun Ji.

191
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,754
Did you meet Il Yong?

192
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,624
He left saying he'd go to your place.

193
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,979
Don't even mention him. I hate his guts.

194
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,154
Did you fight?

195
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,379
What's the point of fighting a dead guy?

196
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:31,119
About Se Young, Bo Ra's mom.

197
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,688
- I think she was taken.
- What?

198
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:37,504
Il Yong said he saw it happen.

199
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:38,565
(Supermarket)

200
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:39,939
Isn't it so suspicious?

201
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,268
Why's he always at the scene of a crime?

202
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,719
Earlier today...

203
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:46,548
Earlier today what?

204
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:48,618
Forget it.

205
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:50,239
Does Bo Ra know about her mom?

206
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:54,239
I shouldn't be here relaxing and wasting time.

207
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,379
Let's go and...

208
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,485
I got a call from Se Young yesterday,

209
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,479
so Detective Shin and I went to find her.

210
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,855
Police searched all night...

211
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,589
then went public today.

212
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:06,418
If she called, that means she's alive.

213
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,489
That's a good thing.

214
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,359
Hello, Wook.

215
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:16,398
I heard the chatter.

216
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,278
Come in.

217
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:21,118
You stay there.

218
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,709
Did you see Il Yong?

219
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,258
Yes.

220
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:30,148
Then you'll have heard of Ro Ha.

221
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:32,678
Ro Ha? No.

222
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:34,798
That's odd.

223
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,288
He said he wanted to ask you a favor about Ro Ha.

224
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:40,459
Did something happen?

225
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,629
Nothing happens to the kids here.

226
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,575
But Il Yong saw something when he was at Ro Ha's.

227
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,369
He was frustrated because he saw but couldn't touch,

228
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,599
so I told him to ask you for help.

229
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,044
That idiot.

230
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,538
That's why I don't like him.

231
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,955
Why? Did something go wrong?

232
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:02,038
Instead of saying what he must, he goes and acts all suspiciously.

233
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,884
What did he do?

234
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:06,018
Ask him yourself.

235
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,099
What?

236
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:10,939
What's wrong?

237
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:14,994
Police have found nothing since they identified Moon,

238
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:16,865
a woman in her 30s who disappeared...

239
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,504
Jong A, this is a new report.

240
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:20,129
Police are expanding the search area.

241
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,148
Okay.

242
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,369
That means she isn't near the payphone she used.

243
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,538
What if the guy took her again?

244
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,459
What?

245
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,639
- What do you mean?
- I know already.

246
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:39,048
The detective showed me a guy's photo.

247
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,579
He said Mom didn't run off with him.

248
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:45,658
If police are searching and she's in the news,

249
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,069
it's bad, isn't it?

250
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,788
It could be something bad,

251
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:54,259
but it could be nothing too.

252
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:55,878
No one knows.

253
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,514
What's important is that we can't reach your mom...

254
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,339
and no one knows where she is.

255
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:04,568
That's why the police are looking for her and so are we.

256
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,128
Right?

257
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,568
(Missing Woman Called In 15 Days... Confusing Police)

258
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:18,318
Do you see me looking so hard my eyeballs might fall out?

259
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,889
I'm not just looking for your mom, I'm looking for him too.

260
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:24,008
Just you wait.

261
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:27,658
I'll find them somehow, whatever it takes.

262
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:36,739
Listen up. A shipment's coming into Yangcheon Port tonight.

263
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,178
We got a tip that Goliath will be there.

264
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,485
(Police)

265
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,055
- Are you all ready?
- Yes!

266
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,955
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

267
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,329
Come along!

268
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,188
- Hello?
- Man Soo, it's Il Doo.

269
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,565
The guy you're working on.

270
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,235
We're putting out a notice for him.

271
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,658
What? Make him a wanted man? Don't you dare.

272
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:03,404
I told you we've been working him for six months.

273
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,374
A person's life is at stake.

274
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:06,744
Do you care only about a hostage?

275
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:08,244
I have a whole team on this case.

276
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,115
We all go down if this raid fails.

277
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,268
Do you want me to wait until she dies, then?

278
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:14,388
You really...

279
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,455
Il Doo. Give me just three hours.

280
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,889
You can do whatever you want then.

281
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,038
What did he say?

282
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:31,339
He wants three hours.

283
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:35,869
What if we lose her?

284
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:38,374
We last heard from her 32 hours ago.

285
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,274
She could be dead or alive.

286
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:43,215
I get that. I want to find her as badly as you do.

287
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,644
But what can I say? They're planning a raid.

288
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:47,284
One mistake, and we all go down,

289
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:48,455
his team and ours.

290
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,249
Darn it!

291
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,648
Hey, Jun Ho. Let's wait just three more hours.

292
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:57,648
Then I'll put out the notice myself.

293
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,595
You all, stop what you're doing...

294
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,119
and go help with the search.

295
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,149
What are you doing?

296
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,119
What?

297
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,468
It's nothing. Let's go.

298
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,178
What's nothing?

299
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:43,059
I don't see anyone or anything.

300
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,335
Hey, change of location! Wondo Port!

301
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,728
- Wondo Port?
- Move it!

302
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:22,748
Are you Goliath?

303
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:28,968
Boss. I think there's a leak.

304
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,309
What's going on?

305
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,539
(Location changed to Wondo Port)

306
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,449
Take care of it.

307
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:20,768
Get moving!

308
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:24,095
Search every corner fast!

309
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,059
- Yes, sir.
- Go that way!

310
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:38,518
Where is she?

311
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:40,548
I said...

312
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,719
I dealt with it.

313
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,379
How can I trust a rat?

314
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,508
You're an informant.

315
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:52,408
I said you're mistaken.

316
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,369
You're mistaken.

317
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,119
Gwang Taek. You're mistaken.

318
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:40,529
Sir, there's no one around here.

319
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:43,468
- Darn it.
- What should we do?

320
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,698
Must you ask me?

321
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,719
Pull out.

322
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:50,548
Guys, let's pull out.

323
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,414
I remember...

324
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:58,678
when I woke up at your place in Duon Village.

325
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:00,995
I was confused about where I was...

326
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,369
and even who I was.

327
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,369
That's exactly how I feel.

328
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,995
It feels like a different world to be here.

329
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,369
You're right about that.

330
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,458
I like being here.

331
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:14,508
What?

332
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,728
You have your own home.

333
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:19,398
I like having you home.

334
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,809
Here, look.

335
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:27,508
Can't you see?

336
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,558
Do you still like it?

337
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,229
Wook.

338
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,629
I see Hyun Ji.

339
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,819
Pull yourself together, Pan Seok.

340
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:39,835
We held her funeral.

341
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:42,265
The living must get it together and live on.

342
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,634
I saw her. I'm telling you.

343
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,505
I see her everywhere.

344
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:48,305
She keeps showing up at school or on the street.

345
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:49,679
It's true.

346
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,954
Go without me.

347
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,708
I won't stay here for good.

348
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:37,978
Goodness.

349
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:54,658
(Supermarket)

350
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,269
It's the man who took Jung A.

351
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,414
Choi Jung A?

352
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,109
- The wedding dress?
- Yes.

353
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:07,914
She came out of the dress shop...

354
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,414
and got in his car.

355
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:11,678
We found the face of an unidentified man.

356
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:13,495
I'm wondering if Bo Ra knows him.

357
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,869
But it seems...

358
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,688
that man took Moon Se Young.

359
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:35,168
(Supermarket)

360
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:08,859
Why isn't he coming? And why can't I reach him?

361
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:12,778
(Dialing)

362
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,868
The phone is turned off.

363
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,309
(Supermarket)

364
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,579
How odd.

365
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,418
It sounded ticklish like leaves blowing.

366
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:32,538
Who is it?

367
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,939
Goodness.

368
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:35,634
What are you doing there?

369
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:38,729
I heard the leaves in my sleep and came out to check.

370
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,999
I think someone new came.

371
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:44,928
Then they would've come here or something.

372
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,119
Hold up.

373
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,108
Don't you hear these steps?

374
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,168
(Supermarket)

375
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,228
That way.

376
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,389
Who is it?

377
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,099
Did you see him?

378
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:07,489
I chased him to the alley but lost him.

379
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,688
- Who?
- The punk who kidnapped Se Young.

380
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,079
Are you sure?

381
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,114
I mean, how did he...

382
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:21,614
If he died, Se Young would be in danger too.

383
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,614
Before they find his body outside, we must catch him...

384
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:25,539
and find out where Se Young is!

385
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:27,579
Why are you...

386
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,249
still here, talking loudly at night?

387
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,819
The man who kidnapped Se Young is here.

388
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,394
- He's dead?
- Yes! He's here!

389
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:38,894
Or did he come here alive like us?

390
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,894
That can't be. When I ran into him outside,

391
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,798
he walked past me without being able to see me.

392
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,674
Then he's dead.

393
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:48,235
Goodness, where is he hiding?

394
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,799
Is he a frightening man?

395
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,168
- How wicked is he?
- He's a murderer.

396
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,039
Then we shouldn't stay still!

397
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,515
Il Yong, you know where the empty houses are, right?

398
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,285
- Yes.
- Where was that?

399
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:02,285
The one at the end of the alley in front of the school.

400
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,324
Yes, across the teahouse.

401
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,955
And check all the other empty houses...

402
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:07,594
- even if the lights are off.
- Okay.

403
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:09,324
Let's go. Give me the flashlight.

404
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,025
No, go with Il Yong.

405
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,295
I'll call Detective Shin outside.

406
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,669
- Okay.
- See you. Darn this...

407
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,565
- Where is it?
- That way.

408
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,428
- Okay, let's go.
- Be careful.

409
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:22,448
Wait.

410
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:24,469
Oh, the kids.

411
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,215
What's going on?

412
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,009
I'm sure I got stabbed.

413
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,399
What is this?

414
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:56,904
Gosh, this is bad.

415
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:59,005
Should I make a loud announcement?

416
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,834
But it's late at night.

417
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,498
You might wake up the whole neighborhood.

418
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:05,104
I'm just here out of concern for the kids.

419
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:07,769
I'll take care of the kids.

420
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,485
By the way, I hope they catch him soon.

421
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,384
Tell me about it.

422
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:15,138
What a big ruckus in the middle of the night.

423
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,038
What the...

424
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:34,229
It's exactly the same as my house.

425
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:03,688
Yes, Mr. Wook?

426
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:05,289
Se Young's abductor is dead.

427
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:06,939
- What?
- He died,

428
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,298
and I saw him in the village Il Yong lives in.

429
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,574
What that means...

430
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:12,945
His body hasn't been found.

431
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:15,098
Yes, exactly!

432
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:17,315
What about Ms. Moon? Where is she?

433
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,844
I have no idea.

434
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:22,215
He ran off as soon as we locked eyes.

435
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,654
The whole village is looking for him...

436
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,378
while I'm out here calling you.

437
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:30,489
They're looking for someone whose dead body is missing?

438
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,618
It sounds absurd to me too,

439
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,219
but that's just how it is.

440
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,029
What's important is that her abductor is dead.

441
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:41,235
What about Se Young, then?

442
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,829
Doesn't it mean she's in more trouble?

443
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:45,868
The accomplice could've killed the abductor and taken her.

444
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:48,329
They will be on alert since the police are looking for her,

445
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,168
but you never know what they'll do in a pinch.

446
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,129
So yes, she's in more danger.

447
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,255
Anyway, thank you for the status update.

448
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,579
You can thank me after we locate her.

449
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,525
Find the abductor,

450
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,624
ask about her whereabouts, and call me back.

451
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,049
I'll do my best on my end.

452
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:05,888
Sure. Thanks, Detective Shin.

453
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,929
He's nowhere on that side of the village.

454
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:14,898
He wasn't in the alleyway of my house either.

455
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:18,729
Wook, are you sure you saw him?

456
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:20,775
Yes, I'm sure.

457
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,009
I followed his trail after I saw that it was him.

458
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,018
Even a ghost would gasp at this.

459
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:27,079
Why would a ghost gasp at something like this?

460
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,908
Don't worry. I won't be gasping.

461
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:33,549
Like Wook said, someone new came to the village.

462
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,894
We can't stay up all night looking for him though.

463
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:37,549
It's too dark to see anything properly.

464
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:40,094
He might come out of hiding any time soon,

465
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,089
so let's look for him in the morning.

466
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,235
- Right.
- Sure.

467
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,388
I'm tired, so I'll be heading home.

468
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:51,168
It's late, Wook. You should get going.

469
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,644
Why would I...

470
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:54,299
when Se Young's abductor is here?

471
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:03,248
For some reason, his demeanor is icy cold.

472
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,158
Tell me about it.

473
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,208
My gosh!

474
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,369
Why? What is it?

475
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:28,299
I found it.

476
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,419
You found my mom?

477
00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:32,978
No, the guy.

478
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,989
No can do.

479
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,779
- How so?
- I hacked into the CCTV footage.

480
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,119
I can't make you my accomplice.

481
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,558
I won't tell anyone that I saw the video.

482
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,659
I still can't let you.

483
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:55,299
Jong A, please.

484
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,869
Fine. Just know...

485
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:08,485
that you didn't see anything if anyone asks.

486
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:11,648
Actually, whatever you saw is all on me.

487
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,529
Got it?

488
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,659
- That's the guy.
- Right.

489
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,828
The night your mom called from the payphone,

490
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,104
he was caught on two different cameras.

491
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,478
This one and...

492
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,938
It's like he wants to be filmed.

493
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:36,888
Right?

494
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:41,747
Later, he was caught on this camera too.

495
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:44,909
But here, he tried to stay inconspicuous.

496
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,849
My guess is that it's where your mom is.

497
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,509
You're here.

498
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:03,908
Let's go.

499
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:13,458
Who knew such a place existed?

500
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:29,868
Is that it?

501
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,644
Didn't you say we'd be training for field day?

502
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,018
When will we go outside?

503
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,759
Well...

504
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:25,025
Yes, we'll be training for field day in the classroom today.

505
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:27,095
Why did you shut the curtains though?

506
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,155
Right.

507
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,089
Shouldn't we train for field day outside though?

508
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,918
I'm sure you remember...

509
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:37,834
the flags of all nations that are hung for field day.

510
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:39,974
- Yes!
- No, I don't.

511
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:41,675
The flags on the string?

512
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,369
That's right.

513
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:45,969
You'll be drawing them today.

514
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:47,788
Nice.

515
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:53,919
The school is secure.

516
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:57,354
Of course. The children must be protected.

517
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,894
I'll look around the village, so stand guard.

518
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:01,268
- Be careful.
- Got it.

519
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,299
Hold on. Wasn't I here earlier?

520
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,379
Darn it.

521
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,109
No way.

522
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,949
Am I stuck here?

523
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,739
(Supermarket)

524
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,969
How can I help you?

525
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,049
Could I borrow your phone?

526
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,208
Mine doesn't have any service.

527
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,839
I see. Hold on a second.

528
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,779
Why don't you take a seat?

529
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,045
I only need to make a phone call.

530
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,014
Judging by your gaunt face,

531
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:03,598
you must not have eaten for a few days.

532
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,018
I'm right, aren't I?

533
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,849
Don't gawk at me for no reason and eat while it's warm.

534
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:12,949
- I'm good.
- But I'm not.

535
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,279
Now that I've seen you,

536
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,825
I won't feel better until you eat.

537
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,199
Dig in.

538
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,389
It's not like I'm trying to keep you here or anything.

539
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,708
Sorry?

540
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:28,178
What did you just say?

541
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:31,029
What? Did I say something?

542
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,739
I told you to dig in while the food is warm.

543
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,009
I just cooked the rice,

544
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,608
and it's to die for.

545
00:40:42,978 --> 00:40:44,478
Dig in already.

546
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,029
I'll enjoy it.

547
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,458
It's good.

548
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,438
I also find the food I make to be good as well.

549
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:22,089
You don't seem like someone who'd do something bad.

550
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,899
Sorry?

551
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:30,029
What is it? Did I say something again?

552
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,188
I didn't though.

553
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,408
Please dig in.

554
00:41:40,538 --> 00:41:41,888
Have this too.

555
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:55,549
- Is he not over there?
- No.

556
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,494
I see he wasn't over there either.

557
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:01,219
He's hiding well in this small neighborhood.

558
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:03,268
Darn it.

559
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,308
Did you help him hide?

560
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,379
What?

561
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,704
I told you. I don't even know him.

562
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,728
Why are you getting so worked up?

563
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:14,728
Getting worked up like that only makes you look more suspicious.

564
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:17,788
Darn it!

565
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,909
Gosh, I should just keep my mouth shut.

566
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,689
Eat more.

567
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:26,199
They say even ghosts look healthy if they were well-fed before they died.

568
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:31,748
What? Don't people say that these days?

569
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:34,138
They do, but...

570
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,169
Anyway, thank you for the food.

571
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:43,628
Oh, it's okay.

572
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,808
You little... There you are.

573
00:42:53,878 --> 00:42:55,378
How could you be eating now?

574
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,248
Good timing. I was wondering how I should tell you.

575
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,719
Just let him finish the food.

576
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:03,925
You shouldn't even bother dogs when they're eating.

577
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,299
Captain Kang.

578
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:07,834
The whole town is in emergency mode now because of him.

579
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:09,208
Don't you know that?

580
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,135
The kids are all stuck in their classrooms.

581
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,858
We've been patrolling the area all day and haven't even eaten yet.

582
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:15,879
Hey.

583
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:17,874
Where is Moon Se Young?

584
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:19,469
Hurry up and tell me where she is.

585
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:38,589
Put that down, and we'll talk.

586
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:41,169
Who are you?

587
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,069
Did Gwang Taek send you?

588
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:44,609
Or...

589
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:47,439
Goliath?

590
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,268
Hey, what do you mean someone sent me here?

591
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,339
Who? Gwang Taek?

592
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:58,158
Who is Gwang Taek?

593
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,578
And who is Goliath?

594
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,208
Is that a real gun?

595
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:07,124
Yes, it is. Ma'am, wait outside.

596
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:09,549
This is my store. Why should I leave?

597
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:12,248
You only die once, not twice.

598
00:44:13,188 --> 00:44:15,418
Captain Kang, just listen to him.

599
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:17,609
Wait outside.

600
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,498
Don't do something you'll regret later.

601
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:36,578
If Gwang Taek didn't send you,

602
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:38,799
then who are you?

603
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,529
The woman you took.

604
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:42,899
Moon Se Young.

605
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:45,339
I'm her friend.

606
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:56,029
We can't cause harm to those in the outside world.

607
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:00,268
No matter how much we try,

608
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:04,938
it never reaches them.

609
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,918
Oh, boy.

610
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,489
I guess you didn't know.

611
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:28,029
Even if you pull the trigger, nothing will happen.

612
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:30,869
So don't waste your time and...

613
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,668
Don't come any closer!

614
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:37,538
It's snack time for the kids, right?

615
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,244
We've got a problem.

616
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:42,608
Wook and the guy who came yesterday are inside, but...

617
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:44,129
No!

618
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,148
Hey! Wook!

619
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,589
Oh, no. He pulled the trigger.

620
00:45:54,313 --> 00:45:55,663
(Stationery)

621
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:02,393
- You little...
- Get off me!

622
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:03,663
You punk.

623
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:05,039
Let go!

624
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:07,092
Wook, are you all right?

625
00:46:08,095 --> 00:46:09,564
I'm okay.

626
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:11,995
But he's not.

627
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:14,871
What? He got shot?

628
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:16,810
You murderer. How dare you...

629
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,141
You deserve to get shot.

630
00:46:18,165 --> 00:46:20,274
- Oh, boy.
- No, he didn't get shot.

631
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,951
I told him the truth.

632
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:23,174
What? The truth?

633
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:24,874
What do you mean I died?

634
00:46:25,044 --> 00:46:26,615
I'm not dead!

635
00:46:26,944 --> 00:46:28,294
Get off me!

636
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:30,621
Goodness.

637
00:46:30,645 --> 00:46:33,531
You just realized that you're here because you're dead?

638
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:35,084
Don't you dare raise your voice at me!

639
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:36,500
You think it's okay for you to kill people,

640
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:38,825
but feel wronged that you're dead?

641
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:41,225
Gosh, my arms are getting tired. Hey, help me here.

642
00:46:42,924 --> 00:46:44,141
- Oh, boy.
- Come here.

643
00:46:44,165 --> 00:46:45,995
You little...

644
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:49,365
What did you do to Se Young?

645
00:46:49,635 --> 00:46:50,741
Where is Se Young?

646
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:52,604
Hurry up and tell me where she is, you punk!

647
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:54,380
Wook, are you hurt?

648
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:55,754
I heard a gunshot.

649
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:01,415
No, no one got shot. It was a mistake.

650
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:04,544
Thank goodness no one is hurt.

651
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,135
No...

652
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:10,164
No.

653
00:47:13,495 --> 00:47:14,845
No...

654
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:18,845
No...

655
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:22,904
Detective Shin, have you checked both videos?

656
00:47:23,104 --> 00:47:25,011
The 2nd one is from 2 days ago.

657
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:27,181
As for the first one, we already had it.

658
00:47:27,205 --> 00:47:28,674
We've checked the second one too.

659
00:47:28,874 --> 00:47:31,480
But why was he deliberately caught on camera once,

660
00:47:31,504 --> 00:47:33,145
then hid?

661
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:36,075
He must be trying to hide something, right?

662
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:38,544
I'm on my way there now, so I'll check.

663
00:47:39,015 --> 00:47:40,495
Have you heard from Mr. Kim Wook yet?

664
00:47:40,854 --> 00:47:43,285
No. He went to pick up Mr. Jang but isn't back yet.

665
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:46,031
He doesn't even come home to sleep.

666
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:47,735
It makes me embarrassed in front of Bo Ra.

667
00:47:55,635 --> 00:47:57,995
Why do you keep crying? You've done nothing to be proud of.

668
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:03,145
Hey, stop crying and tell us.

669
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:07,044
I understand that you're shocked,

670
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:09,391
but can't you just tell us where Se Young is?

671
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:10,821
Has it occurred to you...

672
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:13,584
that Se Young and her daughter could be as scared as you are now?

673
00:48:26,064 --> 00:48:27,414
She's at my place.

674
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:30,515
What?

675
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:33,035
Tell me your address.

676
00:48:57,794 --> 00:49:01,794
(Storage Space, Short Sale)

677
00:49:26,395 --> 00:49:28,230
Hey, the backup team will arrive shortly.

678
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:29,641
Don't move in alone. Just wait.

679
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:31,524
Come as quickly as you can. Hurry.

680
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:46,515
The window in the bathroom will lead you to the back alley.

681
00:49:46,674 --> 00:49:49,374
If someone else shows up, you must run.

682
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:09,234
(Shin Jun Ho)

683
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:11,834
Pick up, Detective Shin.

684
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,495
Don't kill me.

685
00:50:25,415 --> 00:50:26,560
- Please don't kill me.
- Come down.

686
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:27,934
Don't kill me, please!

687
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,654
I'm a police officer.

688

(Shin Jun Ho, National Police Agency)

689
00:50:44,104 --> 00:50:45,454
Darn it!

690
00:50:46,674 --> 00:50:49,475
Ko Sang Chul, that jerk. Where did he hide her?

691
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:52,254
Not there.

692
00:50:53,044 --> 00:50:54,774
That's not where I actually live.

693
00:50:56,785 --> 00:50:58,135
That place is...

694
00:50:58,415 --> 00:51:00,484
I'd infiltrated the drug traffickers so I had to...

695
00:51:02,415 --> 00:51:03,765
rent another place.

696
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:06,575
You're a detective?

697
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:08,874
Yes.

698
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:13,665
I infiltrated the drug gang six months ago.

699
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:17,165
A shipment's coming into Yangcheon Port.

700
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:18,814
Goliath will be there.

701
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:22,104
I made drop-offs...

702
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:25,075
and handed evidence and information to the police.

703
00:51:25,575 --> 00:51:27,015
You were a cop.

704
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:31,515
No wonder. You didn't look like you'd do anything bad.

705
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:34,515
You should've said so as soon as you got here.

706
00:51:34,854 --> 00:51:37,861
Why'd you put the woman in your car drunk and threaten her?

707
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:40,194
Yes, why did you take Bo Ra's mom?

708
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:42,805
Because...

709
00:51:44,665 --> 00:51:46,194
if we got caught,

710
00:51:48,035 --> 00:51:49,385
we'd both die.

711
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:52,935
The residents are coming out. Keep them away.

712
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:55,210
- Get up there quickly.
- Okay.

713
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:56,584
Let's go.

714
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:01,224
Goodness...

Detective Shin.

720
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:39,444
She's fine. She's not badly hurt.

721
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:40,995
Good.

722
00:52:41,814 --> 00:52:43,460
Bo Ra must be excited.

723
00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:45,424
The kid was so stressed out.

724
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:49,895
We got here sooner thanks to Jong A.

725
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:52,440
Jjonga? What did she do?

726
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,794
She'd tracked the culprit to a nearby location.

727
00:52:54,895 --> 00:52:56,011
I was in the area.

728
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:57,385
Oh, really?

729
00:52:58,234 --> 00:52:59,584
That kid...

730
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:01,380
See you. I'll be in touch.

731
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:02,834
Okay. Take care.

732
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:07,865
Il Doo.

733
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:10,415
- Where's Sang Chul?
- What are you doing here?

734
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:13,084
This is Sang Chul's place. Where is he?

735
00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:14,814
Moon Se Young was here alone.

736
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:17,630
The guy who took her is called Sang Chul?

737
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,004
He's not a kidnapper.

738
00:53:19,624 --> 00:53:21,624
Then what is he? Your informant?

739
00:53:23,095 --> 00:53:24,445
He's a detective.

740
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:26,595
He went undercover.

741
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:32,741
(Thanks to your help, Moon Se Young was found and she's safe.)

742
00:53:32,765 --> 00:53:34,115
I'm happy for you.

743
00:53:34,874 --> 00:53:36,705
I said we'd find her.

744
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:41,995
Wook.

745
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:45,584
- They found Bo Ra's mom.
- Yes.

746
00:53:46,615 --> 00:53:49,830
I came to share the news but I'm too late.

747
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:51,204
Did you get the text?

748
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:08,325
How's the detective?

749
00:54:08,404 --> 00:54:10,681
He went to bed and closed his eyes, so I left.

750
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,880
He could be asleep...

751
00:54:11,904 --> 00:54:13,850
or he could've passed out crying.

752
00:54:13,874 --> 00:54:16,690
He didn't even get to eat before all that happened.

753
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:18,520
- Pan Seok, we found Se Young.
- Goodness.

754
00:54:18,544 --> 00:54:19,861
(Supermarket)

755
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:21,235
You found Bo Ra's mom?

756
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:22,391
How is she?

757
00:54:22,415 --> 00:54:24,460
I'll fill you in on the way.

758
00:54:24,484 --> 00:54:26,201
Jong A's buying dinner.

759
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:27,924
Let's all eat until we explode.

760
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:31,024
I'm not allowed to come home without you.

761
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:32,770
Okay, I guess I should go, then.

762
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:34,365
Wait here. I'll get my bag.

763
00:54:34,765 --> 00:54:36,540
Don't take too long. I'm starving.

764
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,504
- Be quiet.
- It must be nice...

765
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:41,234
to have someone waiting at home.

766
00:54:44,245 --> 00:54:46,305
It's just for today since it's a special day.

767
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:48,975
We don't usually have someone waiting for us.

768
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:51,214
You don't have to mind me.

769
00:54:51,385 --> 00:54:53,685
I'm just being a silly old ghost.

770
00:54:53,785 --> 00:54:55,560
You keep saying you're a ghost...

771
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:56,984
and it's upsetting, you know?

772
00:54:57,124 --> 00:55:01,024
I never considered the people here any different from myself.

773
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:04,225
Okay, then.

774
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,540
After 17 days of looking,

775
00:55:07,564 --> 00:55:10,611
police found the missing Moon Se Young.

776
00:55:10,635 --> 00:55:13,080
She seemed anxious when she was found,

777
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:17,205
but she's currently in good health.

778
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:18,750
Police will ask her...

779
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,075
about the circumstances of her disappearance.

780
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:24,245
(Closed for the day.)

781
00:55:33,325 --> 00:55:34,330
Let's go.

782
00:55:34,354 --> 00:55:36,031
I think I saw a frog.

783
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:37,540
- You and me.
- Yes.

784
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:38,600
That's right.

785
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:39,770
There are lots.

786
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,411
Watch your step, kids.

787
00:55:41,435 --> 00:55:42,435
Be careful.

788
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:44,765
Will Bo Ra go home soon?

789
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:47,935
No. Detective Shin said they have more investigating to do.

790
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:50,044
It could still be dangerous.

791
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:52,745
The place will feel empty once she leaves.

792
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,674
It was nice having a busy home.

793
00:55:56,345 --> 00:55:59,314
You know that and you never come home?

794
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:07,531
You can go if you're done. Why are you following me around?

795
00:56:07,555 --> 00:56:09,170
I'm not following you around.

796
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:11,865
I'm off to see the crybaby detective.

797
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:13,734
Then you go home when you're done here.

798
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:15,940
Don't hang around and wait for me.

799
00:56:15,964 --> 00:56:17,314
My goodness.

800
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:19,805
Do you think I wait for you because I like you?

801
00:56:20,035 --> 00:56:21,480
Listen to me carefully.

802
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:25,020
We must ride together to save energy and the environment.

803
00:56:25,044 --> 00:56:28,515
That's how we can afford rent and make Jjonga nag us less.

804
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:30,544
I have this big picture.

805
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:32,484
You don't know anything.

806
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:35,515
I wish I could sew up your mouth.

807
00:56:57,044 --> 00:57:00,214
Ro Ha, will you tell me what you drew?

808
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:05,714
I'm deep in a mountain with Mom and Dad eating some nice food.

809
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,265
I see.

810
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:10,154
Your parents took you on a forest picnic?

811
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:12,334
No.

812
00:57:12,924 --> 00:57:14,274
What happened?

813
00:57:14,555 --> 00:57:16,595
I was left alone on a mountain.

814
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,571
It was so cold, I felt hungry,

815
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:21,135
and I missed my mom.

816
00:57:21,694 --> 00:57:23,805
So I drew what I imagined.

817
00:57:25,705 --> 00:57:27,075
Why did you tear it up?

818
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:34,274
What's going on?

819
00:57:34,444 --> 00:57:36,551
Ha Yoon tore my drawing.

820
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:37,984
This is a bad drawing.

821
00:57:40,615 --> 00:57:43,385
Ha Yoon. Can I have a look?

822
00:58:06,604 --> 00:58:07,954
Cool.

823
00:58:12,285 --> 00:58:13,635
Is this a boat?

824
00:58:13,814 --> 00:58:16,515
It's the kind that floats on a lake.

825
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:19,060
There aren't any here.

826
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:20,825
I haven't seen one.

827
00:58:21,524 --> 00:58:24,371
There used to be one long ago but not anymore.

828
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:27,095
It's a bad boat and the grown-ups got rid of it.

829
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:43,995
Cool.

830
00:58:50,624 --> 00:58:52,730
She should go on breaks too.

831
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:55,730
Captain Kang!

832
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:57,104
Mr. Jung.

833
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:00,310
Have you seen Alice?

834
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,310
What about her?

835
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:04,705
It looks bad. Alice is missing.

836
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:06,480
She's missing?

837
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:08,551
We had a class by the lake.

838
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:10,051
- And?
- She disappeared.

839
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:11,944
You should've kept an eye on her!

840
00:59:12,504 --> 00:59:14,075
Wait for me.

841
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:15,564
Oh, dear.

842
00:59:19,645 --> 00:59:21,385
Alice is missing?

843
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,395
The kids came here to draw and we were packing up to leave...

844
00:59:24,584 --> 00:59:26,130
when I realized she wasn't here.

845
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:27,630
She was sitting over there,

846
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:29,294
but all that's left is her sketchbook.

847
00:59:32,325 --> 00:59:34,440
Take the kids back to the village.

848
00:59:34,464 --> 00:59:35,895
I'll look for Alice.

849
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:38,354
Alice!

850
00:59:42,904 --> 00:59:44,254
Alice!

851
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,245
It's because of the bad drawing.

852
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:53,814
I didn't do anything wrong.

853
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,725
Ha Yoon, take Young Rim's hand.

854
01:00:02,455 --> 01:00:03,805
Let's go.

855
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:23,214
(Supermarket)

856
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:27,055
What's that?

857
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:28,635
Oh, it's nothing.

858
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:32,130
Let me have a look.

859
01:00:32,154 --> 01:00:34,555
Why'd you treasure it if it's nothing?

860
01:00:35,955 --> 01:00:37,040
Is it Ha Yoon's?

861
01:00:37,064 --> 01:00:39,325
No, it's Hyun Ji's.

862
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:42,715
There was something...

863
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:44,810
left of hers?

864
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:47,234
If you give something to someone, that stays behind.

865
01:00:56,645 --> 01:00:58,721
It's a letter.

866
01:00:58,745 --> 01:01:00,615
A letter from my daughter, Hyun Ji.

867
01:01:03,254 --> 01:01:04,604
Of course.

868
01:01:05,555 --> 01:01:06,905
Gosh.

869
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:09,974
Dear Dad.

870
01:01:10,194 --> 01:01:12,924
Now I can read difficult letters.

871
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:15,365
And I'm better at writing.

872
01:01:16,035 --> 01:01:17,805
You'll come and find me, right?

873
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:19,805
Find Ha Yoon too.

874
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:22,805
Young Rim and other kids too.

875
01:01:23,234 --> 01:01:26,645
They miss their parents a lot.

876
01:01:26,805 --> 01:01:29,415
So please find us all.

877
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:33,415
I told them you could do anything.

878
01:01:34,455 --> 01:01:36,415
I miss you, Dad.

879
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,265
I love you.

880
01:01:38,584 --> 01:01:39,934
She wants you to find them all?

881
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:44,564
So she takes after her dad.

882
01:01:44,924 --> 01:01:46,865
She's such a nosybody.

883
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:49,385
I know.

884
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,904
But her uncle can be real nosy too.

885
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:54,951
- You know.
- Yes, I do.

886
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:56,504
Don't you worry.

887
01:01:56,705 --> 01:01:58,444
And don't struggle alone.

888
01:01:58,645 --> 01:02:00,415
We'll find all her friends.

889
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:03,145
Including Alice. Right?

890
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:06,834
Right.

891
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:11,035
Right.

892
01:02:12,654 --> 01:02:14,004
Gosh.

893
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:16,825
No wonder why you're stuck here.

894
01:02:35,444 --> 01:02:38,115
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

895
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:40,221
Why did she call it the bad boat?

896
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:42,960
How did the little kid climb up here?

897
01:02:42,984 --> 01:02:44,584
Who were you with on the boat?

898
01:02:45,455 --> 01:02:46,484
Fish?

899
01:02:46,685 --> 01:02:48,971
Don't you think this town also has secrets?

900
01:02:48,995 --> 01:02:50,400
I'm really curious myself too.

901
01:02:50,424 --> 01:02:52,064
Just what did I do wrong to deserve this?

902
01:02:52,294 --> 01:02:53,701
Nothing scares them.

903
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:56,071
Why would a drug ring commit abduction and murder?

904
01:02:56,095 --> 01:02:58,440
I can't tell you because I only have circumstantial evidence.

905
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:00,834
Who is the owner of this mask?

906
01:03:02,635 --> 01:03:03,985
It's him.
