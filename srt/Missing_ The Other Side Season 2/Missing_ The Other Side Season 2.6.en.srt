1
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,803
He's a really scary man.

2
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:14,880
He's not even a human being.

3
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:16,474
I'm okay.

4
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:21,413
But I feel so sorry for my baby.

5
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,193
My Alice.

6
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:27,284
Please find her for me.

7
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:29,574
I beg of you.

8
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:32,264
Find Alice for me.

9
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,764
Please find her.

10
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,193
Alice!

11
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:58,884
Alice!

12
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:04,093
My goodness. Alice...

13
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:06,073
She's not over here.

14
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:10,294
It'll get dark soon. Where'd she go?

15
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:15,003
Alice...

16
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:25,374
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

17
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,703
(Episode 6)

18
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:37,613
- It's heavy.
- Hey. Ju Won.

19
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,754
- Mom.
- It was another rough day.

20
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:43,194
Hello, honey.

21
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,939
- My gosh, what's all this?
- I brought back the biggest ones.

22
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:49,570
Goodness, you caught quite a few.

23
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:51,439
I'll grill them for you. Go inside.

24
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,839
You're the best, wifey.

25
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,950
What? My gosh. You're so silly.

26
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,409
Gosh, get inside.

27
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,020
Mom, I'm hungry. Cook for me quickly.

28
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:01,420
Son, look at how sweaty you are. You need a back shower.

29
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,550
- I can do it later.
- I'll heat up some water for you.

30
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:04,749
- Hurry here.
- Goodness.

31
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,284
Come on. Here.

32
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,694
It's makgeolli, your favorite.

33
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:21,023
Aren't you happy to have your wife pour you a drink...

34
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,493
when she always nagged you to quit drinking?

35
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:26,903
My dear beefcake son.

36
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,433
I brought your favorite banana too.

37
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:32,384
Hold on.

38
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,004
You probably don't know what beefcake means.

39
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:39,143
I'm a hip mom, you know.

40
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,613
A long stay here has taught me a lot of stuff.

41
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,003
Look at you smiling.

42
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,653
Is it nice to be together without me?

43
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:57,564
I have many good people here too. I'm not lonely.

44
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,564
Oh, right. Did I tell you about Alice?

45
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:03,104
She's the youngest kid in our town.

46
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,273
She refused to eat when she came here.

47
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,614
I wondered if the side dishes didn't suit her palate.

48
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,884
But it turned out she had rice and side dishes separately.

49
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,684
She's really pretty.

50
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:26,003
Wait.

51
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,703
Don't you hear this cry?

52
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,883
What cry?

53
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,654
Hey, Wook!

54
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,123
Wook!

55
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:49,693
Alice?

56
00:05:50,754 --> 00:05:52,104
Alice.

57
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,283
Alice, I'm here.

58
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:58,143
Alice.

59
00:05:58,393 --> 00:05:59,439
Alice.

60
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:01,564
- Come here.
- Goodness.

61
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:03,540
This way.

62
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,110
Let's come down.

63
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:06,484
Gosh.

64
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,009
Gosh, Alice.

65
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:12,179
It's okay now. It's all right.

66
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:15,143
Hey, check if she's hurt anywhere.

67
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:18,574
Let me see. She's all right.

68
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:21,319
- Why is there a boat here?
- What?

69
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:22,693
Beats me.

70
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,984
What is that?

71
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:30,274
Wook.

72
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,494
Wook.

73
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,643
Check this out.

74
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,019
Gosh.

75
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:48,650
(Closed for today)

76
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,314
- Ms. Kang.
- Gosh.

77
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,720
- Hey.
- Gosh.

78
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,094
What...

79
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,259
What's wrong? Sweetie, are you sick?

80
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:57,860
She doesn't seem hurt.

81
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,884
But please look after her. I need to go somewhere.

82
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,900
Why? What's going on?

83
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:04,069
Alice went missing earlier in the afternoon.

84
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:06,824
We searched the whole lakeside and found a boat.

85
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,743
We found her in there.

86
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,663
A boat?

87
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,243
All alone?

88
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:16,004
Yes, I have to go meet Mr. Jang and Mr. Jung there.

89
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,350
- See you.
- Bye.

90
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:18,724
Take care.

91
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:25,924
Sweetie.

92
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:29,153
Who were you with on the boat?

93
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,353
Fish.

94
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,404
Fish?

95
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:42,414
It can't be.

96
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,694
There's no way.

97
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,639
Do we go this way?

98
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:50,013
No, this way.

99
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,280
- That's what I'm saying.
- It's here.

100
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,654
Oh, I see it.

101
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:53,921
Gosh.

102
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,004
- Right.
- Goodness.

103
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,350
It's here.

104
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:59,460
Alice was crying on this boat earlier.

105
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:00,913
Alice was...

106
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:03,754
- here?
- Yes.

107
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:06,653
How did the little kid climb up here?

108
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,153
By the way, why is there a boat here?

109
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:14,900
We used to float it on the lake in the past.

110
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:17,264
No one has ridden on it since I came to this village.

111
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,139
Oh, the footprint.

112
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,309
Look here.

113
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,980
There's a footprint here.

114
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,050
Check this out.

115
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,420
It's way bigger than mine.

116
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,773
I'm sure it's a man's.

117
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,424
Then...

118
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:32,684
did he know about the boat here...

119
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,514
and try to drag her to the lake?

120
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,090
- Mr. Jung.
- Yes?

121
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:39,254
Can't you think of anyone?

122
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,774
Well...

123
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:44,853
This village only has weak kids, women,

124
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,424
and old people like me.

125
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,463
Just who could this be?

126
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,679
We better...

127
00:08:55,703 --> 00:09:00,179
keep the kids away from the lakeside for the time being.

128
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,553
Right.

129
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:05,773
Good girl.

130
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,133
You're done!

131
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,059
Did you enjoy the food?

132
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,433
Yes.

133
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:16,199
Are you sleepy?

134
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,573
Should I give you a piggyback?

135
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:20,873
Come.

136
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:34,374
Twinkle twinkle little star

137
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:38,573
How I wonder what you are

138
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:44,254
I know you like "Twinkle Little Star."

139
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,484
My mom's better at singing that song.

140
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,254
Mom, where are you?

141
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,283
All right.

142
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,043
Let's go inside.

143
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,793
Il Yong's so precise...

144
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:13,443
at guessing exactly what Alice likes.

145
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,683
Oh, how did it go?

146
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,460
Did you find anyone there?

147
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,923
We found a trace but not a person.

148
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,393
His footprint was bigger than mine.

149
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,193
The headmaster banned the kids from going to the lakeside.

150
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:32,070
Keep that in mind.

151
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,444
Okay.

152
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:35,909
- Where's Alice?
- Il Yong...

153
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:38,303
fed her and took her inside to put her to sleep.

154
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,714
But he was nowhere to be seen when we made a fuss to find her.

155
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:46,413
Why do you get worked up every time we talk about him?

156
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,954
For a very good reason.

157
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:54,523
I'll take care of Alice from now on, so don't worry.

158
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,430
Come have a seat inside.

159
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,224
I'll get you something to eat.

160
00:10:58,693 --> 00:10:59,700
- Should we?
- Go on.

161
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:01,994
- All right.
- Come.

162
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:05,043
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

163
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,974
Today's the death anniversary of my husband and son.

164
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,374
They passed away together?

165
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:18,073
He was on vacation,

166
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:20,643
so he followed his dad to fish.

167
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,454
There just had to be an unexpected storm that day.

168
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:29,653
On the first day, only the boat returned.

169
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,773
On the second day,

170
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:35,624
my son was washed ashore.

171
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,864
His dad...

172
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,504
was brought by other fishermen on the last day.

173
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:47,173
When I saw my husband's swollen face,

174
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,514
I felt grateful.

175
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:56,283
He kept our son company so he wouldn't be scared,

176
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,653
sent him back a day earlier,

177
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:02,954
and came back himself too.

178
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,193
I was really grateful for that.

179
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:15,210
There's no need to be all serious.

180
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,350
It's been almost 40 years.

181
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:19,724
Eat up.

182
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,434
Then Captain,

183
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,624
how did you end up here?

184
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,574
Me?

185
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,864
I was disgusted to see that boat...

186
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,039
that I wanted to burn it down.

187
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,604
So I went to the port with a barrel of oil.

188
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,974
But the moment I saw Ju Won, the boat's name, written on it,

189
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,374
I was swayed.

190
00:12:58,573 --> 00:12:59,889
Ju Won...

191
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,789
(Ju Won)

192
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,813
We bought that boat in the year our son was born...

193
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,823
and named it after him.

194
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:14,464
I felt like if I got rid of that boat,

195
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:20,803
all the memory of our family would disappear.

196
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,714
From then on, I rode on it.

197
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:36,854
That's how you became a captain.

198
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,754
That's right. Gosh.

199
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,830
I didn't mind dying anytime...

200
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:44,624
and went out to the sea.

201
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,143
Can you believe it?

202
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:48,393
I lasted five years.

203
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,869
I caught lots of fish and made loads of money.

204
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:54,104
I had several crewmen too.

205
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:56,913
And then...

206
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,443
I got caught in the waves and ended up here.

207
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:10,813
Not having any family left to give me a funeral...

208
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:13,283
must be why the Sea Lord took me away forever.

209
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,624
I'm boring you, aren't I?

210
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:23,693
A story about one's death shouldn't peak an interest.

211
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,293
If it does,

212
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,834
we can laugh and cry over it like we are doing right now.

213
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:33,773
How silly of me.

214
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:38,273
Please dig in. We should at least clink our glasses.

215
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,614
You never wait for us when you drink, Mr. Jang.

216
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:45,503
Keep up the good work.

217
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,334
You're here.

218
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:51,624
He's the Captain of the Drug Squad.

219
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:53,470
- Hello.
- Hi.

220
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,799
How are you feeling?

221
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,173
I slept all day.

222
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:58,613
All I need is to eat and sleep well for the next few days.

223
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,214
I'm glad to hear that.

224
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,840
I'll leave the room and let you talk.

225
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,879
You can stay, detective. I only have a few questions.

226
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,080
I don't do drugs.

227
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,903
I never have, and that's the truth.

228
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,393
I know.

229
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:12,993
Sang Chul...

230
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:16,683
Did the man who took you say anything?

231
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,029
He didn't say much.

232
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:21,683
Just that he'd let me live if I stayed put.

233
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,100
At first, I was kept...

234
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,893
at an unknown container in the woods.

235
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:28,639
When he returned a few days later with food,

236
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,293
I ran away while he was preoccupied.

237
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,834
I was worried about my daughter and missed her.

238
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,273
All I wanted was to hear her voice.

239
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,004
When you called her from the payphone.

240
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:41,993
That's right.

241
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:43,644
But I was caught almost immediately.

242
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,720
He yelled at me saying that...

243
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,720
I would also get him killed, and that scared me.

244
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:48,783
Hold on a second.

245
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:50,813
His life was threatened? By whom?

246
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,361
I don't know.

247
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,705
I asked but he said I was better off not knowing anything.

248
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,399
Don't you have any idea as to why those people...

249
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:00,539
abducted you?

250
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:02,323
Ask my abductor yourself.

251
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,734
He's the one who took me from outside the club.

252
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,639
I'm curious too, you know.

253
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,234
I want to know why this happened to me.

254
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,173
Who would've helped Alice onto that boat?

255
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,984
That has me puzzled as well.

256
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,464
Don't you think...

257
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,564
that this village has its own mystery too?

258
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:28,160
A mystery?

259
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:31,299
Back at Duon Village, Thomas kept bad people captive...

260
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,723
while the people remained clueless.

261
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:34,369
I'm not so sure about that,

262
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,533
but the boat has been eating away at me.

263
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,340
How did it end up on dry land?

264
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,134
It was in the woods...

265
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,104
as if someone had tried to conceal it.

266
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,673
Tell me about it. Did you catch Captain Kang's face?

267
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:52,313
- Captain Kang?
- When you mentioned the footprints.

268
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,884
Whoever it was had bigger feet than mine.

269
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,230
She seemed to know something...

270
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,724
but wasn't sure if she should tell us.

271
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,153
She'd tell us if it's something we need to know.

272
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:06,964
She's someone I know I can trust.

273
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,533
- Do you suspect her of anything?
- No.

274
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,374
I may doubt people, but I'm a good judge of character.

275
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,379
Goodness. Sleep some more.

276
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,504
- No, I'm good.
- Gosh.

277
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,149
It was never my intention to wake you up.

278
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,043
Gosh. I must've drifted off.

279
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,644
Doesn't Alice sleep like an angel?

280
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:05,383
She's a sweetheart.

281
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:07,463
Tell me about it.

282
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,994
She kept asking for her mom in her sleep.

283
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,574
As anyone her age would.

284
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:18,063
Why is she here when she should be in her mother's arms?

285
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:20,443
Unbelievable.

286
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:24,474
What kind of monster harmed this little angel?

287
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:27,744
He isn't even worth being fed to sharks.

288
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:34,083
For some reason, Alice has taken a liking to you...

289
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,343
and Wook.

290
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:41,323
I'm curious about what happened to the girl,

291
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:43,823
so if you come up with a way to ask,

292
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,053
discuss it with Wook.

293
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,913
What is it?

294
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,533
He finds me suspicious.

295
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,584
Is it because of me?

296
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,803
Because of what I said when you first came to live with us?

297
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:04,714
Why would that be on you and not me?

298
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:08,283
Besides, Wook isn't wrong to be suspicious of me.

299
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,434
I wouldn't have been fond of myself either.

300
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:13,633
Il Yong,

301
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,853
there's no need to talk about...

302
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,093
everything you see outside this village,

303
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,164
but confide in me whenever you feel judged...

304
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,033
or wronged.

305
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,563
It doesn't even have to be me.

306
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:31,404
Talk to whoever it is that you can trust and rely on.

307
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:38,923
I will.

308
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:46,623
(Seoun University Hospital)

309
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:49,894
- Mom.
- Bo Ra.

310
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,853
My Bo Ra.

311
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:05,734
(Moon Se Young)

312
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:17,283
Were you hurt? What's with your face?

313
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:19,353
I just don't have any makeup on, that's all.

314
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,304
I'm fine.

315
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,870
I bet you were worried sick.

316
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,244
Of course I was.

317
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,063
Should a mom worry her child like this?

318
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,014
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,614
I'm really sorry.

320
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,603
Mom, let's go home.

321
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:43,994
Sure, let's go.

322
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:46,744
Can I go home with her?

323
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,420
Well...

324
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:51,990
The doctor said I could go home.

325
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:53,930
We still have more questions to ask and...

326
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,454
- Give me a second.
- Sure.

327
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,514
Why didn't you come in?

328
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:08,579
I'd only be intruding.

329
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,303
Gosh.

330
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,210
How is Se Young doing?

331
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,444
Bo Ra's thrilled to go home with her mom.

332
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:15,843
She's still in danger.

333
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,690
We don't even know...

334
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,273
who abducted Ms. Moon.

335
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:21,063
Detective Ko hasn't been found either.

336
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:24,154
Ms. Moon will be taken to a safe house for now.

337
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:27,083
- Bo Ra...
- She can stay with us.

338
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,654
She and Jjonga are like best pals now.

339
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,604
They're alike, aren't they?

340
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,593
Mom wants you to come in, Dad.

341
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:43,573
Dad? Who's your dad?

342
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,934
Well, I...

343
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:49,974
She means that in a way that I'm someone she can depend on.

344
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,890
You should head inside. Bo Ra, let's grab a beverage.

345
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,264
- Sure.
- Good.

346
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:16,414
It's been a while.

347
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,585
Gosh.

348
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:21,344
I look the worst, don't I?

349
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,175
You haven't changed a bit.

350
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:25,995
As if.

351
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,795
I'm sure I'm better looking.

352
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:31,685
- You haven't changed at all.
- Neither have you.

353
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,524
I'm glad you're all right.

354
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,895
Thanks for taking care of Bo Ra.

355
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:42,764
You don't need to thank me.

356
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,055
What about Bo Ra's dad?

357
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,245
She's 14, so...

358
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:58,014
I didn't even dream that...

359
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,145
Bo Ra would track you down.

360
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:05,204
I'm glad...

361
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,524
you're still righteous for no good reason.

362
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,045
It was you.

363
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,245
You...

364
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,165
turned me into that person.

365
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,454
That means...

366
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,274
I was important to you, then.

367
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,595
Alice?

368
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:40,760
- That's her name?
- Yes.

369
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,161
I asked, "What's your name?"

370
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,824
She said, "Alice."

371
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:45,800
Whatever I ask, the answer's always short.

372
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,395
She's so cute.

373
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:51,270
She's still young, so she can't explain in detail,

374
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:53,064
but I think she's mixed-race.

375
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:55,785
Okay.

376
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,310
(Lee Alice, Missing child)

377
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,505
(Year of disappearance: 2022)

378
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:07,445
She's not in the missing child database.

379
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:09,715
Is it not her legal name?

380
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,854
Or she wasn't reported missing.

381
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:17,024
Ro Ha wasn't reported missing either.

382
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:19,231
He came to the village eight years ago...

383
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:20,824
and no one's looking for him.

384
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:24,294
Il Yong went to the kid's home but someone else was living there.

385
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:28,165
Oh, Young Rim's family moved abroad.

386
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,274
- They emigrated?
- Yes.

387
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:34,175
No wonder. I couldn't find a registered address.

388
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:37,215
How do you know all that?

389
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:38,924
Il Yong told me.

390
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:41,735
Il Yong.

391
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:46,084
That Il Yong guy. What's his expertise?

392
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,655
Is he in IT?

393
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:49,431
How does he know their addresses?

394
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,805
Did he hear them himself?

395
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:53,840
I guess so? He told me that...

396
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:56,070
No, forget it. I don't want to know.

397
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,135
Don't tell me. I'll do things my way.

398
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:03,165
I'll call you when I find everyone on the list.

399
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,675
- It won't take long.
- Okay.

400
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,065
My goodness.

401
00:25:13,985 --> 00:25:15,385
Why complain to me?

402
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:19,415
I don't get why she's like that.

403
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:23,554
Is she becoming more like Wook?

404
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:04,165
Are you busy? Let's go somewhere.

405
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,412
No, thanks.

406
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:07,804
You said you want to know what I do.

407
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,034
See for yourself.

408
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,215
What are you up to?

409
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,364
Forget it.

410
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,155
Are you going on another picnic?

411
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:30,695
With Alice?

412
00:26:31,854 --> 00:26:33,300
Hello, mister.

413
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,441
Oh, hi, how are you?

414
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:37,034
Say you're doing great.

415
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:40,580
I packed some porridge for the crybaby detective.

416
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:42,641
He's stuck in his room and won't eat.

417
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,050
Let me carry it for you.

418
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:45,604
No, it's not even heavy.

419
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,221
What do you take me for, Captain Kang?

420
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,044
Would I offer to carry it if it were heavy?

421
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:52,124
Hand it over.

422
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:56,934
Let's go.

423
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,094
You can't still be like this.

424
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,005
You didn't eat anything all day yesterday.

425
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,750
I made some porridge.

426
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:23,405
Will you sit up and have some?

427
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:30,014
Go outside and soak in some sunshine.

428
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:34,655
Right now, you must feel like all is lost,

429
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,854
but you'll feel better in a few days.

430
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:54,224
Lee Gwang Taek?

431
00:27:58,574 --> 00:27:59,651
Who are you?

432
00:27:59,675 --> 00:28:01,114
Hello, I'm...

433
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:04,185
Detective Shin Jun Ho from the Missing Persons Squad.

434
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:06,014
So what?

435
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:08,161
Do you know Ko Sang Chul?

436
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,270
He was reported missing.

437
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,225
- I don't know him.
- Are you sure?

438
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,895
I was told you know him well.

439
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,570
Says who?

440
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:21,834
Will you just take a look?

441
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:23,435
You might know him.

442
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:31,290
I don't know him. Never saw him.

443
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:32,664
But...

444
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,995
Lee Gwang Taek and Goliath.

445
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:50,141
I heard those names while looking for Detective Ko.

446
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:51,871
I paid Lee Gwang Taek a visit...

447
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:54,965
and the punk said he didn't know the guy.

448
00:28:58,334 --> 00:28:59,774
Gwang Taek?

449
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,482
Gwang Taek?

450
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,544
Yes, he asked if Gwang Taek had sent me.

451
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,265
Goliath?

452
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,584
We can't find Detective Ko without your help.

453
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,854
You know more than anyone.

454
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:20,364
(Restricted Area)

455
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:27,010
(A better tomorrow, correction of hope)

456
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,834
Go and see Ro Ha.

457
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:30,975
And don't come back.

458
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:44,735
Hello.

459
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,314
Are you going to Seoul?

460
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,330
I drove a customer over,

461
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,500
happy to make some money,

462
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:56,564
but I couldn't find anyone to drive back to Seoul.

463
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,015
Oh, well.

464
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,355
Did you just get out?

465
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:05,525
What?

466
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:07,424
Oh, this?

467
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,844
Yes. I was released today.

468
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:13,814
You had a rough time, then. Congratulations.

469
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:17,885
You didn't have a welcoming party?

470
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:21,685
I wrote home to say I'd find my way back.

471
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:25,395
I was too ashamed. I wasn't a great family man.

472
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:28,094
How long were you away for?

473
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:30,294
Nine years.

474
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,010
I feel so bad for my wife and kid.

475
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:39,175
What, nine years? Your kid must've grown, then.

476
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,114
I last saw him when he was eight.

477
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:46,245
He'll be in high school now.

478
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,514
I'm worried I won't recognize him.

479
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:54,060
You haven't seen him even once?

480
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:57,524
After the trial, I told my wife not to visit.

481
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:01,395
I said I'd send home what money I can,

482
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,465
so she should pretend I don't exist...

483
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:06,395
and raise our boy as best she can.

484
00:31:08,104 --> 00:31:12,104
I said we'd meet again once I'd done my time.

485
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,685
All I have is a photo of him as a kid.

486
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:25,185
I imagined what he'd look like a million times,

487
00:31:25,685 --> 00:31:27,685
but I just can't imagine.

488
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:45,651
You didn't have to drive me all the way. Thank you.

489
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:47,025
I had fun chatting.

490
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,765
Whose house is this?

491
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:58,194
Ro Ha's.

492
00:31:58,314 --> 00:31:59,854
Ro Ha's name is Lee Ro Ha.

493
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,161
This says Byun Seok Ha lives here.

494
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,594
This is where Ro Ha used to live.

495
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:07,225
I think someone else lives here now.

496
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,094
There's a letter addressed to Ro Ha.

497
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,245
Read it for me.

498
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:16,364
He kept writing to this address not knowing they moved?

499
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,745
(To Lee Ro Ha)

500
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,124
Someone's coming.

501
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,134
Right.

502
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:40,805
Ro Ha.

503
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:45,195
It looks like your useless dad will be home soon.

504
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,034
Does he not know Ro Ha's missing?

505
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:51,055
He must be in prison.

506
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:56,405
You were a little boy the last time I saw you.

507
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:58,495
You must've gotten so big.

508
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,284
I'll do my best to become a dad you're not ashamed of.

509
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:05,904
And...

510
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,885
I'll treat you twice as well to make up for the lost time.

511
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,024
Let's go on trips with your mom...

512
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,395
and live a happy life together.

513
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:16,924
(Byun Seok Ha, Yeonghyeon-ro 103-6)

514
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,424
Who are you?

515
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,915
I'm sorry, but when did you move here?

516
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:36,391
It's been a while.

517
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,814
Then do you know where the people who lived here moved to?

518
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:41,624
No, I don't. Ha Il, let's go.

519
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,131
- Hurry up.
- What's the rush?

520
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:47,665
Come on.

521
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:55,411
Ro Ha. Let's have a lot of fun today with me and your mom. Okay?

522
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:58,135
Let's go!

523
00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:00,945
(Our Happy Family, Lee Jin Sung, Ko Eun Jung, Lee Ro Ha)

524
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:04,115
(Byun Seok Ha, Yeonghyeon-ro 103-6)

525
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,814
How sad.

526
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,755
You didn't tell Ro Ha's dad about Ro Ha. Did you?

527
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:12,405
I couldn't.

528
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,415
I just dropped him off in front of the house.

529
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,325
What happened to Ro Ha's mom then?

530
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:22,241
Do you think she was with Ro Ha at the time of his incident?

531
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:25,064
If that was the case, she'd be here with him.

532
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:27,735
I'm sure Ro Ha's dad will look for her now.

533
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:29,910
He waited for nine years.

534
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,814
He didn't seem like the type to give up easily.

535
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:33,385
He can't.

536
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:37,290
Ms. Lee. You're going to get sick.

537
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:38,744
Take your time.

538
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:40,445
- Can you go to the kitchen?
- Okay.

539
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,890
Jjonga, were you working here by yourself?

540
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,930
You should've told us.

541
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:45,554
I wanted to finish up the kitchen first.

542
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:48,285
Once the tables are set up,

543
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:50,060
we can open up in a couple of days.

544
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,330
Take your time! Nobody's rushing you.

545
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:53,370
I can't!

546
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:55,834
We need to put the equipment in the office and find the kids!

547
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,894
This is a matter of my pride.

548
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:01,011
The person to find the most exact information faster...

549
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:02,385
is key here.

550
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,204
Is Oh Il Yong listening to us somewhere?

551
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,520
Ms. Lee. Can you take a look at this for a second?

552
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:10,350
Okay. I'll be right there! I'm going back inside.

553
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,215
(Undergoing interior construction)

554
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,120
"Is Oh Il Yong listening?" What's she talking about?

555
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:17,885
She's acting like that because she wants to find the kids quickly.

556
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,361
You know her personality.

557
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:20,925
I should go and do what I need to do.

558
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,804
Where are you going?

559
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:24,335
To the school.

560
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:32,135
The kid in the white shirt is named Lee Ro Ha.

561
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,164
He's been here for eight years.

562
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:37,235
There are kids who have been here longer than Ro Ha though.

563
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,855
So what?

564
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,644
Nobody reported Ro Ha missing.

565
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:45,120
That means nobody is looking for him,

566
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,191
or they don't know he's missing.

567
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:48,565
That...

568
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,631
That isn't comforting at all.

569
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:52,005
I'm not comforting you.

570
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,394
I was just telling you about him.

571
00:35:58,354 --> 00:35:59,994
I'm just saying that's Ro Ha's situation.

572
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:02,870
Everyone here is dead,

573
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,741
and their bodies haven't been found.

574
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,115
Who can comfort whom?

575
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:17,994
You still look sad.

576
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:21,421
What's wrong with a dead person looking sad?

577
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,160
Why are you getting mad? You have such a weird personality.

578
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,534
It's very weird.

579
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,470
Detective Ko, come here. I have something to say.

580
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:32,844
I don't.

581
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,000
Gosh.

582
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:35,500
Doesn't Ro Ha's dad get out today?

583
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:36,874
You said you were picking him up.

584
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:38,910
I dropped him off at his house.

585
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:41,054
He should've figured out that Ro Ha's missing by now.

586
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,704
Do you think he knows he's dead?

587
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,535
He'll find out soon enough.

588
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,274
Detective Ko! Hold on.

589
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,321
There used to be one long ago but not anymore.

590
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:59,115
It's a bad boat and the grown-ups got rid of it.

591
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,755
Why did they call it a bad boat?

592
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:07,695
Right. Ms. An.

593
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:10,140
Hyun Ji's dad will help you...

594
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:11,865
make the flags of all the nations.

595
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:13,211
Hello.

596
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:15,711
The images of the flags are in the classroom. I'll get them.

597
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:17,085
Okay.

598
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:20,805
Who drew this?

599
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:22,421
It was Alice.

600
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:25,274
I told the kids to draw what they did that day.

601
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:27,985
I see. There are two people on the boat.

602
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,065
I wonder who the other person is.

603
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,031
If she didn't know them, I'm sure she was scared.

604
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:35,405
- You're right.
- Right.

605
00:37:36,024 --> 00:37:37,870
No. It's not like that.

606
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,970
She drew a big boat and colored it yellow.

607
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:43,200
This signifies that while she was on the boat,

608
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:44,574
she felt safe and had fun.

609
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,140
You can tell that from the drawing?

610
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,274
Ms. An was an art therapist.

611
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:53,025
I see.

612
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,080
- Do you see the fish on the boat?
- Yes.

613
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:59,921
The fact that something that belongs in the water isn't...

614
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,445
is usually how kids under five portray a change in fantasy.

615
00:38:03,744 --> 00:38:06,255
They don't do this when they feel uncomfortable.

616
00:38:07,624 --> 00:38:09,425
So she had fun on the boat?

617
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:12,854
Do you know which person from the village played with Alice?

618
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,524
Good question. I'm not sure.

619
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,035
But it still doesn't make sense.

620
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:22,204
Ha Yoon said something strange to Young Rim.

621
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:25,104
That the adults got rid of it because it's a bad boat.

622
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:26,724
"A bad boat?"

623
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,020
Did something happen on the boat?

624
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,191
Do you know anything?

625
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:33,350
By the time I got here,

626
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:35,515
the boat was already on the land.

627
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:38,485
Oh, we should ask Captain Kang.

628
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:41,454
She was here the longest.

629
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,655
Why are you curious about that?

630
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:47,564
The woman you abducted...

631
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,334
- Se Young and I...
- Is she your girlfriend?

632
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:56,334
We just know each other well.

633
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,435
If a man and woman know each other well, aren't they dating?

634
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:01,954
Not anymore.

635
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,724
She's your ex?

636
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:07,224
I don't know what you're talking about, but let me listen too.

637
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:16,124
My first job on the Drug Squad was going undercover.

638
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:18,994
It was a drug ring that was active through social media.

639
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:20,371
(Person in Charge in Korea, Goliath, Unknown)

640
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:22,075
The ID of the person in charge is Goliath.

641
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:24,970
If he posts an ad in a secret chatroom,

642
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:27,235
people use cryptocurrency to purchase drugs.

643
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,640
Once he receives payment,

644
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:30,434
he drops it off, and they pick it up.

645
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:33,350
As you can see, they run on a point operation,

646
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:35,651
but over the past year or two, they got bigger.

647
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,044
They do wholesale and retail.

648
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,520
Going after the gophers...

649
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,345
won't reveal the drug ring,

650
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:43,015
(Name: Ko Sang Chul, Undercover)

651
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:44,885
so we sent Sang Chul undercover.

652
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,191
You said Ko Sang Chul is new.

653
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:48,584
Nobody knows his face.

654
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:52,224
It was a secret investigation that only 1 or 2 of us on the team knew.

655
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:55,124
Why would a drug ring abduct and murder people?

656
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:57,124
They're not afraid of anything.

657
00:39:57,664 --> 00:40:00,071
There are some addicts who get drugs on credit,

658
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:01,455
and if they can't pay them back...

659
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:02,881
they take out and sell their organs.

660
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:05,410
Oh, my gosh. They take out and sell what?

661
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:06,784
Those lunatics.

662
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:07,921
What?

663
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:10,075
They take out and sell organs in Korea?

664
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,191
Gosh, those evil jerks.

665
00:40:13,215 --> 00:40:14,421
It's hard to do in Korea,

666
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,861
so they abduct them and send them to China.

667
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:17,060
So they can work on them there.

668
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,991
They usually inject them with an anesthetic, put them in a box,

669
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:20,365
and smuggle them onto a boat.

670
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:22,785
But Choi Jung A died in the box.

671
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,724
They asked me to take care of it in secret,

672
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:28,465
but I sent her to the shore for the police to find.

673
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:31,135
So why did you abduct Se Young?

674
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,765
She said she never used drugs.

675
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:36,365
I got a text message while I was working.

676
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,305
We don't know the reason.

677
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,144
If we get an order, we just do it.

678
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,465
Who gives you the orders?

679
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,195
Goliath.

680
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:50,961
That day was D-Day.

681
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:52,830
A large amount of drugs were coming in,

682
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:54,425
and Goliath was coming himself.

683
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:57,100
Sang Chul told us the changed location,

684
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,695
but we lost contact with him after.

685
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,600
So if we want to catch Goliath,

686
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:04,334
we need Detective Ko's help.

687
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,465
If something happens to Sang Chul...

688
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:10,834
Do you think that woman's okay?

689
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,885
Do you think she's still alive?

690
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,655
I'm sure she is.

691
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:19,314
Thank you for saving Se Young.

692
00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:22,945
That's why I became a cop.

693
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:27,954
To protect the safety and lives of the people.

694
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:34,605
It's all over now though.

695
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:37,934
Goodness. You did a great job,

696
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:39,784
you crybaby detective.

697
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:42,505
Here. Eat this while you talk.

698
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,974
Then... Detective Ko,

699
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,615
how did you end up here?

700
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:56,785
What's the last thing you remember?

701
00:41:58,555 --> 00:41:59,905
Gwang Taek.

702
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,925
I was locked in a container,

703
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:04,155
and then Gwang Taek stabbed me.

704
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,024
What country flag is this?

705
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:09,564
Is this the top and that the bottom?

706
00:42:10,765 --> 00:42:12,711
Can't you tell?

707
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:15,040
It's the flag for the imaginary country.

708
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:16,711
You can put it any way you want.

709
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,874
Nobody would know even if you put it upside down.

710
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:21,445
The kid who drew this wouldn't know either.

711
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,324
I see.

712
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:28,015
Ro Ha drew this one. Didn't he do a great job?

713
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:31,755
Goodness. Ro Ha is great at drawing.

714
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:34,584
He's got a great eye and is very expressive.

715
00:42:34,825 --> 00:42:35,930
His dream is to become an artist.

716
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:39,325
What? He told me his dream was to come in first place in running.

717
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,664
The first place prize is an easel and paint set.

718
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,465
I think he said that because he wants the set.

719
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:47,695
But there also seems to be a different reason too.

720
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:51,310
Ms. An, you know so much about the kids.

721
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:53,405
Is it because you talk to them a lot?

722
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,020
Some kids tell me about themselves...

723
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:58,374
and some kids I figure out through their drawings.

724
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:00,945
Could I take a look at them?

725
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,995
I'd like to hear your interpretation of it too.

726
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:04,465
Sure thing.

727
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:06,405
Promise me that.

728
00:43:06,854 --> 00:43:08,204
Sure.

729
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:11,095
Get it done and sent upstairs.

730
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:13,144
How can we help you?

731
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,465
The patrol division sent me to you.

732

(Lee Jin Sung, Wife: Ko Eun Jung, Son: Lee Ro Ha)

(Transactions)

734
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:28,921
(November 6, 2014: Jungsung Maeum Hospital)

735
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:30,295
Well,

736
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:34,374
your wife Ko Eun Jung hasn't been active for eight years.

737
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:36,620
It's why we checked unclaimed bodies...

738
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:39,155
and Jane Does that were accidentally killed.

739
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:40,905
An accidental death?

740
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:45,055
Yes, just to be sure, but we couldn't find her.

741
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:47,524
Instead, we found her medical record...

742
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,825
on the National Health Insurance Service database.

743
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:55,905
Are you saying that my wife is injured?

744
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:58,334
No, it's not like that.

745
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:00,405
She's in a psychiatric hospital.

746
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:04,644
Then, what about Ro Ha?

747
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:08,314
Is Ro Ha with her?

748
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:11,414
No, just your wife.

749
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:13,655
Maybe you should see her...

750
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,124
and ask where your son is.

751
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,171
(Jungsung Maeum Hospital)

752
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:23,341
She was suffering from alcohol abuse and was delusional...

753
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:24,965
when she was admitted.

754
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,765
She didn't get any better...

755
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:28,680
which is why we've been keeping her here.

756
00:44:28,704 --> 00:44:30,111
Alcohol abuse?

757
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,704
But she couldn't even manage a sip.

758
00:44:32,474 --> 00:44:34,505
Who signed the admission consent form?

759
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,675
Ms. Ko herself.

760
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:39,264
I see.

761
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:42,425
This is her room.

762
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:05,655
Honey.

763
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:18,135
Ro Ha's mom?

764
00:45:19,715 --> 00:45:21,065
It's me.

765
00:45:26,494 --> 00:45:28,724
Why are you here, honey?

766
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,144
Why?

767
00:45:32,865 --> 00:45:34,465
And where's our Ro Ha?

768
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:38,735
Our son Ro Ha...

769
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:46,044
Get a grip on yourself, Eun Jung!

770
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:49,660
Our son Ro Ha.

771
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:51,691
Where's our Ro Ha?

772
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:52,991
Please don't provoke the patient.

773
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:55,325
Where's our son Ro Ha?

774
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:56,804
Please leave.

775
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,624
Honey!

776
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:01,825
Detective Oh.

777
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:03,470
Sir, you must not do this.

778
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,770
Let's take a look at the medical records...

779
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:07,334
of all the patients here.

780
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,104
- Honey!
- Got it.

781
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:12,075
I love the atmosphere here.

782
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,281
Kids draw here...

783
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:15,845
and sit down to talk.

784
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:19,091
You mentioned how you wanted to see the kids' drawings.

785
00:46:19,115 --> 00:46:20,092
That's right.

786
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:22,184
You could read them by observing their drawings...

787
00:46:22,445 --> 00:46:24,015
which intrigued me.

788
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:27,385
Could I see one by Ro Ha? He's quite the little artist.

789
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:29,105
Sure.

790
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:36,564
Gosh. I see he drew a lot of these green ones.

791
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,434
Eun Hee kept them well stored.

792
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:42,765
Ro Ha came to this village eight years ago,

793
00:46:43,005 --> 00:46:45,675
so these were here long before I came along.

794
00:46:46,735 --> 00:46:50,374
Why do they seem exactly the same though?

795
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:54,044
He drew these shortly after he came to this village.

796
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:56,220
They're of trees and the woods,

797
00:46:56,244 --> 00:46:58,991
but you can see how dark they are...

798
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:00,531
as if no light shines on them.

799
00:47:00,555 --> 00:47:02,925
I sense fear from his drawings.

800
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:06,901
The trunk narrows as it reaches the top...

801
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,325
which means he drew this from his point of view.

802
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:12,035
The surrounding elements were drawn in detail too.

803
00:47:12,294 --> 00:47:15,305
It makes me believe that this is something he remembers.

804
00:47:15,505 --> 00:47:18,535
This is a place he has seen or been to before?

805
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:20,224
That's right.

806
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:27,374
What could this be though?

807
00:47:29,115 --> 00:47:30,720
Ms. An, are you here?

808
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:31,755
Yes.

809
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:33,061
Right.

810
00:47:33,085 --> 00:47:35,231
Goodness. Mr. Jang, you're here too.

811
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:37,361
- Let's get going.
- Where?

812
00:47:37,385 --> 00:47:38,925
You'll see when you get there.

813
00:47:39,294 --> 00:47:40,801
Don't you agree? There they are.

814
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,241
Hurry up, will you?

815
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:43,765
What took you so long?

816
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,064
Gosh.

817
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:47,540
You being this way is surely an issue.

818
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,341
Mr. Jang, do you have an issue? Are you sick or something?

819
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:52,211
Me? What...

820
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:54,211
No, I'm perfectly fine. Why?

821
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,604
Your issue is that you seek attention.

822
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:58,890
See? You always arrive last...

823
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:00,651
just so that you can get all the attention.

824
00:48:00,675 --> 00:48:03,890
I couldn't see you anywhere when I was working my butt off.

825
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,461
Only when I was done, you...

826
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:09,985
What have you been feeding him that made him so talkative?

827
00:48:11,595 --> 00:48:13,671
Why is everyone here anyway?

828
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:16,100
The school field day takes place in a few days.

829
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:17,470
That's why we gathered.

830
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,941
Your hand is too darn salty!

831
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:21,315
Darn.

832
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:24,265
Why is everyone gathered for the field day though?

833
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,535
Because it's the biggest event of every year.

834
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:30,805
It's why we're getting ready for it.

835
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:32,355
We go all out, you see.

836
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,290
Everyone seems to be present.

837
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,244
Mr. Jung, you're up.

838
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:45,224
That's how we'll split into Blue Team and White Team.

839
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:49,741
Next up is the mission race.

840
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:52,735
We need to discuss the first mission.

841
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:56,235
Would it be better to have them run with candies in their mouths...

842
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,405
or have them eat a sticky rice cake...

843
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,810
without using their hands at the table.

844
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:02,374
- Mr. Jung.
- Yes?

845
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:04,950
Sticky rice cakes...

846
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:07,091
usually clog up our throats.

847
00:49:07,115 --> 00:49:09,261
Wouldn't they choke on them...

848
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,525
if they run after eating them without using their hands?

849
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,430
We should have them eat them with their hands...

850
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:17,330
or just run with the rice cakes in their mouths.

851
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,555
Captain Kang has a point.

852
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:20,755
Right.

853
00:49:20,994 --> 00:49:23,825
Then, let's have them run...

854
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,241
with the sticky rice cakes in their mouths.

855
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:28,865
- Sure.
- Good one.

856
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:30,680
Who knew that running...

857
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,350
with sticky rice cakes in their mouths...

858
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:34,011
needed serious deliberation?

859
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:35,405
I told you, didn't I?

860
00:49:35,704 --> 00:49:37,305
We go all out for this event.

861
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:40,250
I like how it reminds me of old times.

862
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:41,520
- Of course.
- That reminds me.

863
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:43,520
Who'd like to volunteer to help out at the event?

864
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:44,894
What?

865
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:46,934
Us.

866
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,161
Let go of me.

867
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,830
- Keep me out of it.
- Let's do it together.

868
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,370
Il Yong and Detective Ko will help out at the event.

869
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:53,954
- Good.
- How nice.

870
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,265
Do whatever you want, then.

871
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:59,035
Why aren't you volunteering?

872
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:02,604
That guy will also help out.

873
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:05,381
Seriously. I'd rather you sink alone.

874
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:07,575
That'd be no fun since I'm already dead.

875
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:11,381
He's not wrong, you know.

876
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:13,091
Whose side are you on, Mr. Jang?

877
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:14,821
Me? Well, I'm...

878
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,814
As if anyone is taking sides here.

879
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,591
Il Yong, what are we doing today?

880
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:22,285
We'll be running to get ready for field day.

881
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:24,624
- Yes!
- Nice!

882
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:27,231
I already practiced my sprint this morning.

883
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:28,605
Really?

884
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,294
Regardless of age and gender,

885
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:32,965
they take field day very seriously.

886
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:35,310
Preschool, Junior, and Senior.

887
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,281
There will be three teams like this,

888
00:50:37,305 --> 00:50:39,135
and we'll train one group each.

889
00:50:39,805 --> 00:50:42,704
Detective Ko, what's with this new-found enthusiasm?

890
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:44,874
It's not like you to be proactive.

891
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:46,890
I always get the job done...

892
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:48,594
even when it's not something I want to do.

893
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,160
This is why I'm fond of you, Detective Ko.

894
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,790
I always get the job done too.

895
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:54,294
I still don't have much faith in you.

896
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,735
I'll take the Senior kids.

897
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:58,524
Then...

898
00:51:03,064 --> 00:51:04,695
The Preschoolers have chosen me.

899
00:51:08,095 --> 00:51:09,934
- Come on.
- But...

900
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:13,180
But I need to stay back and study for my exams.

901
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,921
Exams are to test what you already know.

902
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:17,374
You aren't meant to cram,

903
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:19,144
but study on a daily basis.

904
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,274
And today is a part of that daily basis.

905
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:22,885
It's not.

906
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:26,314
Janggoon, Munggoon, you guys are coming too.

907
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:28,885
Bo Ra, get Jjamppong for me.

908
00:51:30,024 --> 00:51:31,374
What's special about today?

909
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,825
Today? I'm opening my cafe.

910
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,064
You promised to help when the time came.

911
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:38,410
Since it's the first day, there will be a rush of customers,

912
00:51:38,434 --> 00:51:39,941
and we'll be super busy.

913
00:51:39,965 --> 00:51:42,204
That's how it is on opening day, you know?

914
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:44,535
Janggoon, Munggoon, let's go.

915
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:51,755
This is the place, right?

916
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:56,144
Gosh, I'm sorry.

917
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:57,835
Goodness.

918
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,055
I'm sorry about that. Are you all right?

919
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:03,605
I'm good.

920
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:15,135
- Mister.
- Mister.

921
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:16,441
- Hello.
- Hello.

922
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:18,481
Hey, guys. It's good to see you.

923
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:19,482
Hop in.

924
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:21,310
- I call shotgun.
- No, me.

925
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:22,421
Rock-paper-scissors.

926
00:52:22,445 --> 00:52:24,644
- Not you.
- Hold on.

927
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:27,215
- I'm sitting in the front.
- Come on.

928
00:52:28,985 --> 00:52:31,115
Ta-da. What do you think?

929
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,706
Let's go inside.

930
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:39,026
This is your new home.

931
00:52:44,896 --> 00:52:46,171
Stay in here.

932
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:47,545
(Janggoon, Munggoon, Jjamppong)

933
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:49,805
Can I take Jjamppong inside?

934
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:52,836
No, Jjamppong can't go inside yet.

935
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:55,876
I'd like to.

936
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:57,651
No, you can't.

937
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,615
Wait out here, Jjamppong.

938
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:02,546
Jjamppong, you stay here.

939
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:08,361
There are no passers-by.

940
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,856
Who'd come here for coffee?

941
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:28,746
Happy birthday to you

942
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:32,015
Happy birthday to you

943
00:53:32,215 --> 00:53:38,285
Happy birthday, dear Bo Ra Happy birthday to you

944
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:41,526
Wait.

945
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,385
You must make a wish first.

946
00:53:58,305 --> 00:53:59,655
Happy birthday.

947
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:01,646
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

948
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,945
- Make way.
- Goodness.

949
00:54:05,115 --> 00:54:08,485
I need to put these down.

950
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:11,432
Bo Ra, open these later.

951
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,816
Okay. Thank you.

952
00:54:13,385 --> 00:54:14,735
Happy birthday.

953
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:19,526
You said it's the cafe's grand opening.

954
00:54:19,796 --> 00:54:20,972
It is.

955
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:23,126
Your birthday party's doubling as the opening party.

956
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:24,746
Have fun with your friends.

957
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,381
Girls, I got a lot of food.

958
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:39,292
- Okay.
- Eat before it gets cold.

959
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:40,491
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

960
00:54:40,515 --> 00:54:42,416
The surprise was a huge success.

961
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,416
- Enjoy the food.
- Thanks.

962
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:54,626
Thank you, for everything.

963
00:54:58,765 --> 00:55:00,115
Let's eat.

964
00:55:05,905 --> 00:55:07,255
Look.

965
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:10,305
You should laugh.

966
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:12,416
Mr. Jang, Wook, come with me.

967
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,925
Okay.

968
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:16,345
- Try some of this.
- Okay.

969
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:18,565
Come here.

970
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:21,835
You're hilarious.

971
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:33,296
Ta-da! This is our new hideout.

972
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:37,066
My gosh. What the...

973
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,585
Oh, gosh.

974
00:55:40,235 --> 00:55:42,305
Compared to the pawn shop office...

975
00:55:43,706 --> 00:55:45,056
This is amazing.

976
00:55:46,015 --> 00:55:47,365
Nice.

977
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:51,215
The pawn shop was nice and safe as well.

978
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,015
This place is even safer.

979
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,626
I had special cameras put in every corner.

980
00:55:57,126 --> 00:55:59,972
Alarms, security cameras, wiretap alerts,

981
00:55:59,996 --> 00:56:02,066
fire detectors, magnet detectors.

982
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,595
There are even simultaneous motion sensors.

983
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:07,982
If there's an intruder, we get a text,

984
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:10,405
and real-time footage is sent to our phones.

985
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,805
Will the police be alerted automatically?

986
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:14,111
No.

987
00:56:14,135 --> 00:56:16,706
The current law states someone must call in person.

988
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:19,222
But the three of us will be alerted at the same time.

989
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:21,122
When you said you'd open a cafe,

990
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:23,285
I wondered what had gotten into you.

991
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:25,256
This was the reason.

992
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,055
I'm glad Jjonga's on our side.

993
00:56:33,595 --> 00:56:34,945
My gosh.

994
00:56:35,695 --> 00:56:37,142
Was I faster than before?

995
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:38,996
No, not at all. The time's the same.

996
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:42,365
You trained enough today. Let's continue tomorrow.

997
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:43,765
Your friends all left.

998
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:45,805
Look, the sun will set soon.

999
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:47,905
I'll try just one last time.

1000
00:56:48,246 --> 00:56:49,606
Blow the whistle for me.

1001
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:53,666
Ready.

1002
00:56:55,215 --> 00:56:57,086
- This is the last lap.
- Okay.

1003
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:09,265
Thanks to Detective Ko, Se Young got out alive.

1004
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:11,566
So did I.

1005
00:57:11,735 --> 00:57:13,235
But he couldn't save himself.

1006
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,215
Lee Gwang Taek stabbed him...

1007
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:18,556
in a container at Wondo Port.

1008
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,746
We searched all the containers.

1009
00:57:28,985 --> 00:57:32,285
Will you find the poor crybaby detective soon?

1010
00:57:33,186 --> 00:57:34,536
I will.

1011
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:47,066
I couldn't have done this without you.

1012
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:49,511
I always helped you out in a big way.

1013
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:51,235
I gave you so many tips.

1014
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:54,206
You just don't remember them all.

1015
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,575
Why? What is it?

1016
00:58:01,075 --> 00:58:04,186
I can't say anything yet because it's just a hunch.

1017
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,215
If I ever call, pick up right away.

1018
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:10,956
If something happens to me, it's on you, okay?

1019
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:20,885
(Commercial parking)

1020
00:58:27,075 --> 00:58:29,051
If I'm not back in ten minutes, call the cops.

1021
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:30,706
What? Okay.

1022
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:38,785
I was told a drunk customer had passed out in the room.

1023
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:42,285
It happens a lot, so I didn't think much of it.

1024
00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:45,972
When I saw her, she didn't look like she was drunk.

1025
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:47,346
It was drugs?

1026
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:49,825
Yes. That's what it looked like.

1027
00:58:50,496 --> 00:58:52,611
Detective Shin, show her the photo.

1028
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:53,985
Okay.

1029
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:55,686
Was it...

1030
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,016
this woman?

1031
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:06,626
(Manager Kim)

1032
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:12,916
Yes, I recognize the face.

1033
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:15,885
Was anyone else in the room?

1034
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,706
Anyone else?

1035
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,002
There was a man.

1036
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:22,566
The man who took you?

1037
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:25,365
No, it wasn't him.

1038
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,175
Who are you?

1039
00:59:57,325 --> 01:00:00,095
Come on in. Join me for a drink.

1040
01:00:02,706 --> 01:00:04,056
You got the wrong room.

1041
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:06,805
This is the right room!

1042
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:10,276
Jjonga, I'm coming in!

1043
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:12,376
Darn it.

1044
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,025
I said no.

1045
01:00:16,086 --> 01:00:17,436
Just you wait!

1046
01:00:17,816 --> 01:00:19,356
I'll be back after a pee!

1047
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:32,735
Who is he meeting...

1048
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:35,305
that he needs bodyguards?

1049
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:38,655
What man?

1050
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:40,812
The woman was out,

1051
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,646
but he looked too normal so I asked if they were a party.

1052
01:00:44,976 --> 01:00:47,046
- Are you together?
- No.

1053
01:00:48,115 --> 01:00:49,465
I thought it was my room.

1054
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:51,666
He said no.

1055
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:54,091
He said he'd come in thinking it was his room,

1056
01:00:54,115 --> 01:00:56,356
and he bumped into me as he left in a hurry.

1057
01:00:56,925 --> 01:00:58,275
Hey.

1058
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,965
Something of his fell on the floor.

1059
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:05,635
What was it?

1060
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,646
A mask.

1061
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:12,006
Hang on. Did it...

1062
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:15,776
look like this?

1063
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:19,316
Yes. This is it.

1064
01:01:28,086 --> 01:01:29,586
I apologize.

1065
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:36,545
Nice mask.

1066
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:41,566
Who does this mask belong to?

1067
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:47,126
Goliath.

1068
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,305
He's the person...

1069
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:52,865
we're trying to get.

1070
01:02:03,925 --> 01:02:06,256
Hey, what are you doing here?

1071
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:08,405
What about you?

1072
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:20,556
It's him.

1073
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:24,726
That guy killed me.

1074
01:02:45,235 --> 01:02:46,585
And...

1075
01:02:49,805 --> 01:02:51,155
I was in league with him.

1076
01:02:54,006 --> 01:02:55,356
I am also...

1077
01:02:56,976 --> 01:02:58,326
a murderer.

1078
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:29,421
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

1079
01:03:29,445 --> 01:03:31,452
In league with him to do what? Murder?

1080
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,151
Did you sell drugs and kill people?

1081
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:36,292
I'll tell you everything, so let's go somewhere else.

1082
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,215
Pil Joong will come here again.

1083
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:41,155
He hid the evidence underneath the car's back seat.

1084
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:42,502
Lee Gwang Taek did it.

1085
01:03:42,526 --> 01:03:44,162
And Detective Ko hid the evidence.

1086
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:46,256
Should I tell you a secret?

1087
01:03:46,425 --> 01:03:48,626
Can I really place first then?

1088
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,336
He doesn't know what kind of trouble he went through.

1089
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:53,885
Ro Ha.

1090
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,706
Where are you?
