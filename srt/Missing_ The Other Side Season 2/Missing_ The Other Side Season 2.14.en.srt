My captain on deck is nowhere to be seen.

I killed her.

Why did you kill her?

16
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,235
After losing my finger on the job,

I took up gambling while on leave.

But I ended up in debt.

19
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:22,315
I didn't have a solution to my money problems,

20
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:28,155
and that's when I thought of Eun Sil's insurance policy.

21
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:36,396
My wife wasn't aware of what I had done,

but one day,

23

she started seeing Eun Sil's spirit.

24
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:43,205
She could hear her voice as well.

25
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,406
It seemed as though my wife was paying for my sins,

26
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,775
and I haven't been able to be in peace.

I'm so sorry.

28

I don't need a trial or anything else.

29

Just serve me the death penalty!

30

You are one selfish man.

Save your apologies for the victim.

32
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,765
Her dead body was desecrated though.

What was the reason for that?

34

Come on in.

35
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,745
Why are you absentmindedly standing by the door?

36

You're even in matching suits.

What? We were.

39
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,156
I made yukgaejang, so have a bowl.

40

She cooked yukgaejang of all things?

How can this be?

About what?

44
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:27,575
Are you going to tell her?

45
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,115

Like I told you, I drowned at sea.

Did Sun Hee know?

He didn't tell his wife.

58

Why wasn't I allowed to die and move on?

85

Why should I be the one to end up here?

Come back tomorrow to cry some more.

92
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:14,135
Then come back the day after.

93
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,505
Then you'll feel a bit better.

94

Or not.

95
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,016
I'm being punished.

96
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:33,456
I said that your death was a dreadful one.

97
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:39,695
I asked how could a son do that to his dad.

98
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,195
It was dreadful.

99

I had no idea...

what had happened to me.

101
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,045
I lived 50 years and was dead for 30...

102
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:02,045
and it was all a waste.

103
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,985
How was that a waste?

104
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,925

So what?

Where's Pil Joong?

There was an accident.

114
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:23,196
I told him time and time again not to do drugs.

Are you looking for this?

116

It's mine.

117
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,446
Before I give it back.

118
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,176
I'm looking for what's mine.

119
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,946
What do you mean?

120
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,816
Pil Joong said you had it.

121
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:48,625
You're pretty gutsy.

122
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:51,456
What did you think you could do with it?

123
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:55,596
What are you talking about?

124
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:02,466
You stole from me.

125
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,405
I did not.

126
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,015
Pil Joong said...

127
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:17,985
you touched my stuff. Was that a lie?

128
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,456
What...

129
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,625
What did I take?

why did Pil Joong keep you alive all this while?

if a shock to the system will jolt your memory.

139

Will it?

140

Why is Captain Kang still there when we found her body?

00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,375
What was all that about?

170
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:57,806
What happened?

171
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,733
- Are you okay? - Yes.

172
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,904
You didn't know how fast I could run, did you?

173
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,472
I used to train in track and field.

174
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:22,514
What?

175
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,343
Do you think Wook will be okay?

176
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,953
I said I'd dress up and go with him,

177
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:30,853
but he said he'd do better alone.

178
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,384
I hope he gets the timing right.

179
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:34,884
Oh, gosh.

180
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,313
A deal's a deal.

181
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,613
This is how you do business.

182
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,024
Il Yong.

183
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:14,693
That weasel.

184
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:18,093
It's you again, getting on my nerves.

185
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:20,664
Push Il Yong this way.

186
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:23,534
Then I won't...

187
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,244
show myself again.

188
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:28,613
Do you know that guy?

189
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,473
I told you. I don't know him.

190
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,812
He says he doesn't know you.

191
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,613
Why must you keep showing up, ruining things?

192
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,554
I really wanted to know who was behind Goliath.

193
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:47,764
Are you Mr. Noh?

194
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:49,733
Noh Yoon Gu?

195
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,083
You are the real Goliath, aren't you?

196
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,754
You jerk.

197
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,384
You got people addicted to drugs.

198
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,082
I saw on the news that a man...

199
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,693
killed his own eight-year-old son under the influence of drugs.

200
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,494
As if that wasn't enough,

201
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:21,664
you kidnapped people...

202
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,462
Some of the addicted kids run tabs.

203
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,904
If they can't pay what they owe, they sell their organs.

204
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:29,374
You even trafficked human organs.

205
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:34,703
And you still call yourself human?

206
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,683
The people you killed in secret...

207
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:42,913
whose bodies are nowhere to be found.

208
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:52,974
Have you ever thought about their families?

209
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,264
Is it a crime to make the debtors pay me back?

210
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:03,133
Okay, fine.

211
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:04,804
Take him.

212
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,103
Here, take him.

213
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:24,994
Go on.

214
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,194
Let's get out of here. Stay put.

215
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:41,373
Wait.

216
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:44,904
Are you done saying your goodbyes?

217
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,514
It'll be your last goodbye, so take your time.

218
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:49,913
Hey.

219
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:55,494
You probably don't remember it,

220
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,454
but many people received help from you.

221
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:00,794
On behalf of them...

222
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:04,333
This time, I'll help you.

223
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,044
Don't make a stinky mess.

224
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:27,853
It's time we put an end to this.

- Darn it... - Hey, are you all right?

229
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:44,903
Get them! Go!

230

Hey, stop right there! You little...

231

Darn it.

232
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:24,113
Don't move.

233
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,954
Detective Shin, Noh Yoon Gu is still inside. Zone X, 35.

234
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,113
- Take care of him. You, with me. - Yes, sir.

235
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:37,254
Let's go.

236
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:34,843
Wook!

237
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:36,853
Here.

238
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,984
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

239

Gosh, Il Yong.

Il Yong, are you all right?

241
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:49,633
Yes, I'm okay.

242
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:51,863
Anyway, who are you people?

243
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:55,704
Should I tell you? Even if I told you, you wouldn't know.

244
00:20:56,073 --> 00:20:57,974
Your memories will come back, little by little.

245
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,974
I'm so relieved that you're okay.

246
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,873
You know me too?

247
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,583
I know you very well.

249
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,684
Mr. Kim, how did you know that Noh Yoon Gu would be there?

250
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,383
I didn't know.

251
00:21:15,954 --> 00:21:17,794
I went there to find Il Yong.

252
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,294
Right.

253
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,333
So how did you know that Il Yong was there?

254
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:26,433
You know, the day Il Yong was admitted to the hospital...

255
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,314
That was when I started preparing for this day.

256
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:29,673
A GPS tracker?

257
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:31,734
On me?

258
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:35,813
Where?

259
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:46,423
Ta-da!

260
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:49,823
This may look funny, but it really works.

261
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,663
This... You know that this is illegal, right?

262
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:58,263
You see, we had to do it...

263
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:00,563
even though we knew it was illegal. Try to understand.

264
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:02,833
Gosh, you guys are really something.

265
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,974
Anyway, we actually know each other?

266
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:11,043
My, the three of you are like special forces agents.

267
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:14,684
Did you guys start a private detective agency or something?

268
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:18,254
Oh, a private detective agency.

269
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,653
I hadn't thought of that.

270
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:23,993
I was just kidding. Goodness.

271
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,794
Anyway, I know you always got my back, Detective Baek.

272
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:28,093
Thanks.

273
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,934
Why are you thanking me?

274

I'm a cop. It is my job to protect and serve.

How do I go about opening a private detective agency?

Do you remember everything that happened before you collapsed?

278
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:44,073
You told Kim Pil Joong to turn himself in.

279

- That's... - Oh.

280
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:49,013
They still need to run more tests on him.

281
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:50,694
Talk to him when that's all taken care of.

and find my body.

That way, Ji Hoon will pay for his crimes...

Because it's you.

00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:12,823
"that he came all the way here to where Hyun Ji used to be."

333
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,994
"How unfortunate he must be."

334
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:18,994
That's what I thought.

335
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:22,363
But a little while later,

336
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:26,734
I saw Hyun Ji's friends leave one by one,

337
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,274
and I knew.

338
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,944
It was you.

339
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:36,873
It wasn't just Wook by himself.

340
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,413
It was you...

341
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:42,613
who had been doing the same work.

342
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:48,083
So, you've known for a while?

343
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:55,093
I also have plenty of stories to tell about my kid,

344
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,694
so I couldn't bring it up easily.

345
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:01,833
I see.

346
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:07,544
I know it's shameless of me, but after a long time has passed,

347
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:12,073
when Ji Hoon is ready to accept the situation,

348
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:17,383
please go to him...

349
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,383
and comfort him.

350
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:26,464
When he was a little kid,

351
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:32,034
he used to be pure, just like Hyun Ji.

352
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:37,804
Yes.

353
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:42,143
I'll be sure to go see him.

- Eat up. - Thanks.

357
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:15,603
But why did you want to see me this early in the morning?

358
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:18,873
What is it? Did you not go home last night?

359
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,944
I won't beat around the bush.

360
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,882
It's not for the private detective you mentioned,

361
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,123
but there are some people that someone asked me to find.

362
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:30,024
Then they can just come directly to the police.

363
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,193
I came instead.

364
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:34,563
Those people have their reasons for not being able to come.

365
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,563
Here. Please find this man for me.

366

all true?

00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:20,443
What happened to the search warrant for Jung Young Jin's house?

Who gave this information that it's so detailed?

It totally sounds like the missing person's own statement.

Hope?

00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:52,234
Il Yong came back to life.

Come on. He was different from us to begin with.

Why?

Do you feel like you want to live?

my Ji Hoon.

00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,034
Mr. Jung Ji Hoon?

398
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,373
Who are you?

399
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,204
We're here to search your house.

400
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:28,803
- All right, we'll just be a second. - What is this?

401
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:30,543
- Excuse me. What is this? - Let's get going.

402
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,313
What are you searching for? Hey, mister.

403
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,984
Before my wife died of an illness,

404
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:39,014
she told me her dying wish.

405
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:43,454
"Please take good care of Ji Hoon."

406
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,294
"Raise him to be a good man."

407
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,633
But then, in the end,

408
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:53,004
he became a murderer...

409
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,004
who killed his own father for money.

410
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:03,044
Before Wook and Pan Seok came here,

411
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:05,643
I taught the kids...

412
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:09,044
that hopes are things you dream of.

413
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:11,684
But now,

414
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:16,323
I teach them that hopes are things that come true.

415
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:21,393
The only hope that I have left...

416
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:24,333
is for Ji Hoon...

417
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,403
to become a new person.

418
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,573
Admitting and paying for his crime...

419
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:38,073
and becoming a better man than before.

420
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:41,784
Then,

421
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:44,153
I think...

422
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:47,323
I could forgive him too.

423
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:51,194
Why are you going in there?

424
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:53,764
Mister. Darn it.

425
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:56,863
Let me go! Mister.

426
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:59,534

The second to the right shelf on the right side.

430
00:32:07,544 --> 00:32:08,774
The book is called "Scabs."

431
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,284
Hey, you're here.

432
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:16,383
Yes. You were here too, Mr. Jung.

433
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:18,653
I ran out of cooking oil.

434
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:23,823
Ms. An. Let's have a cup of tea together.

435
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,264
- Yes, have a seat. - Shall I?

436
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:34,764
All right.

437
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:44,673
There you go.

438
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:47,014
- What book is that? - Oh, this?

439
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:49,244
A book Mr. Jung gave me.

440
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:54,622
For the past few days, I've been looking really hard...

441
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:58,593
through this Rilke fellow's book, and I finally found it.

442
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:00,464
Where?

443
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,694

444
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:05,994
All right. Listen carefully.

446

"it would be this."

447
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:20,684
"Do not think that this person who tries so hard to console you..."

I'm going to turn myself in.

483

Turn yourself in?

484

have weeks of physical therapy left.

Sure.

What's with that face though?

00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:40,945
and we've been putting the move off because of that bad man.

496
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:48,735
We'll have a housewarming party, so please come.

497
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:51,715
Sure thing.

498
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:06,166
Hyun Ji.

499
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,065
Dad,

500
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:11,206
did you read my letter?

501
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,405
Of course, I did.

502
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:17,675
Gosh, then you must've met Ha Yoon and Young Rim too.

503
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:20,076
- Did you meet my teachers as well? - Yes.

504
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:23,345
The hairband you gave Ha Yoon...

505
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,615
looked great on her.

506
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,686
You got me that at the amusement park.

507
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:30,396
- Right? - Yes.

508
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:34,226
Ms. Eun Hee had the sweetest smile.

509
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,524
By the way, Ha Yoon...

510
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:39,336
knew that I was the one who helped you move on.

511
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:40,836
Because I told them.

512
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,635
I told them that you'd come for me.

513
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:45,475
I promised them...

514
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,345
that you'd help them too after finding me.

515
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:51,576
And that's a promise I most certainly kept.

516
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:55,815
Ha Yoon and Young Rim left while having fun on the swings,

517
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:59,455
and Ro Ha left as he won the sprint...

518
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,255
during the village field day.

519
00:41:01,385 --> 00:41:02,485
Really?

520
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:04,425
My dad is the best.

521
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:06,005
No, my Hyun Ji is the best.

522
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:09,565
Dad,

523
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:14,465
thank you for keeping your promise.

524
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:21,445
Aren't there any of my friends left at Industrial Complex Three, then?

525
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,416
Actually, a few more came by.

526
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:28,646
Some are younger than you.

527
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:32,056
I wish they'd stop coming.

528
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:35,786
Don't you worry, I'll find them all.

529
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,956
I'm going to brag about it to my friends.

530
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:42,925
Are you leaving so soon?

531
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:47,666
Yes, it's time for me to go.

532
00:41:57,876 --> 00:42:00,146
Thank you for being my daughter.

533
00:42:07,856 --> 00:42:09,126
In our next life,

534
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,755
please be my daughter once again.

535
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:21,166
Next time,

536
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:24,806
I'll...

537
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,905
Next time,

538
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:34,746
I'll...

539
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,086
Next time,

540
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:46,126
I'll...

541
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:51,836
What the...

542
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:06,985
My gosh.

543
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,445
Look at you, Mr. Jang. You look sharp today.

544
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:40,146
Are you going somewhere?

545
00:43:40,246 --> 00:43:41,345
Well...

546
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:45,985
I'm off to see Hyun Ji and her mother.

547
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,126
Are you heading to work?

548
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,646
Yes, I'm off to discuss the campaign for missing children.

549
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:51,726
I really appreciate that.

550
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:00,635
Il Yong, what...

551
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:02,565
Are you heading out?

552
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:05,734
- Yes. - He's off to the police station...

553
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:06,976
to turn himself in.

554
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:10,646
You should wait until you're in better shape.

555
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,976
Because of me, innocent people were hurt.

556
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:15,246
I should've turned myself in sooner.

557
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,286
My confession is long overdue.

558
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,385
Will we not get to see you again?

559
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:22,655
Who knows?

560
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:26,326
Good for you.

561
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,795
You made a courageous decision.

562
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:33,396
Thank you.

563
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:37,135
Call me if you need anything.

564
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:38,936
I will.

565
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:41,445
Il Yong.

566
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,746
Can I give you a hug?

567
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:56,786
Take care.

568
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,266
Wook, look after him.

569
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,646
Then will Il Yong go to prison?

570
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:19,876
He has no record and he's cooperative,

571
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:21,485
but I don't know yet.

572
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:25,714
He looks all sweet and frail but he's a tough kid.

573
00:45:25,715 --> 00:45:27,626
He's a great survivor.

574
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,126
He came back from death's door.

575
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,126
Wrap this one for me.

576
00:45:36,925 --> 00:45:38,634
You didn't take drugs yourself,

577
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,936
you turned yourself in, and you're remorseful?

578
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:43,436
Yes.

579
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:46,706
Still, you worked for Goliath and that's organized crime.

580
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:50,076
Right.

581
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:52,115
Do you have any info we could use?

582
00:45:55,945 --> 00:45:58,485
I don't know if this will be of any help.

583
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:02,885
This is Kim Pil Joong's ring.

584
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:05,154
We had an identical pair made.

585
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:06,456
I switched them.

586
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:11,396
He said there's evidence inside.

587
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:13,565
What's that?

588
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,465
I don't know what it is.

I met Hyun Ji in a dream.

She never came to me once in 17 years,

594
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,215
but this time she stayed to chat.

595
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:11,356
It must be nice to be with our baby.

596
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,666
I'd love to join you.

597
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:22,905
But Hyun Ji gave me a load of homework.

598
00:47:24,536 --> 00:47:25,876
So I can't join you...

599
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:28,246
for a while yet.

600

605

So it doesn't become just a campaign for show, we'll get volunteers...

606
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,166
to help with actual searches.

607
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:27,336
That sounds great,

608
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:30,336
but it'll cost a lot of money.

609

About that.

610
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,705
We have a plan to cover expenses.

Now they've decided to go all out.

The day you saw us in suits...

635
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:10,635
was the day of your funeral.

636
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:13,576
We thought...

637
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,206
you'd be gone.

638
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:23,945
That's why you looked like you'd seen a ghost.

Then...

Say something.

643
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:44,976
I did it.

644
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:50,445
I never even dreamed she was in that freezer.

645

If I'd known,

646
00:50:55,416 --> 00:51:00,715
when I found her with her leg caught in the net,

I wouldn't have untangled her and let her drown.

I thought my husband...

649

had pushed Eun Sil into the sea.

650

I hoped she'd move on without losing any limbs.
