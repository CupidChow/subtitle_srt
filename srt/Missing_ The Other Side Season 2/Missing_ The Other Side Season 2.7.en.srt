what he did?

00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,246
Clear up all loose ends...

I'll collect the goods when the time is right.

Who are you to collect what belongs to me?

That's what you get for doing a sloppy job.

You just had to hire a nark.

And I told you I tied up loose ends.

That's one thing less to worry about.

- what are you doing here? - What about you?

19
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,016
It's him.

20
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,055
That guy killed me.

21
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,555
And...

22
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:34,926
I was in league with him.

23
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,165
I am also...

24
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:40,936
a murderer.

25
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,186
You...

26
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:02,626
Let's hurry out of here.

27
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:18,906
Where did you go?

28
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,075
He's gone. We should also leave.

29
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:26,316
Go where?

30
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:30,985
Who is that punk?

31
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:34,756
We're friends from middle school,

32
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:36,425
and he sells drugs via social media platforms.

33
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,596
His name is Kim Pil Joong, and we're...

34
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:41,596
You're in league with him? Committing murder?

35
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,265
Did you sell drugs and kill people?

36
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:46,066
No wonder you raised red flags.

37
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:47,536
But I didn't expect you...

38
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,936
to be a scumbag.

39
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,276
Pil Joong will come back.

40
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:00,445
We have to go.

Captain Kang.

42
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:06,485
Does she know what you are?

43
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:12,126
It wasn't intentional though.

44
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,295
I killed him.

45
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,475
It's true your actions were wrong.

46
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,075
But so what?

47
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,776
Whenever I lie down to sleep,

48
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:33,945
his face keeps popping up.

49
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:43,885
I guess the guilt stays with you even in death.

50
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:50,895
This isn't a place where we're judged by our past actions.

51
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:53,265
No one here can punish you,

52
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:56,366
and what you did doesn't get magically erased.

53
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,075
I know that.

Don't speak of this to anyone again.

Don't say what you told me.

57
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,885
What you did among the living...

58
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,756
and what happened before your death.

59
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,686
Don't speak of it to anyone.

60
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:17,686
Why not?

61
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:20,496
The people here have enough on their plate...

62
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,726
without you adding your baggage onto it.

63
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:26,095
Let your guilt stay with you.

64
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,135
It is yours to manage internally.

65

I'll tell you everything, so let's get out of here first.

76
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:26,796
As a kid,

77
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,765
our family was penniless.

78
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,436
It was just me and my mom.

79
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:38,405
My mom was sick and had to stay home.

80
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,205
Since middle school,

81
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:42,246
I took on all the part-time jobs I could.

82
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,715
I worked my butt off,

83
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,585
but it couldn't cover her medication let alone her hospital bills.

84
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,215
That's when Pil Joong approached me.

85
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,496
Pay your mom's hospital bill.

86
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:04,465
Ten thousand dollars?

87
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,736
That's a large sum of money.

88
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,066
We were close in middle school.

89
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,275
But then we lost touch for a while, and he showed up loaded.

90
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,876
He offered to help me earn money,

91
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,546
so I quit my part-time jobs...

92
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:22,416
and made deliveries to where Pil Joong sent me.

93
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,686
The job was easy, but he paid me a lot.

94
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:32,655
What I delivered were drugs.

Come on. Let's get going.

107
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,405
A father who beat his son to death...

108
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:49,866
was arrested by the police.

109
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,405
Around 11pm on the 20th, Min who resides in Gahyeon-dong...

110
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,046
started to assault his son when he wouldn't stop crying...

111
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,645
and asking for food.

112
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,746
Neighbors reported the commotion,

113
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:03,215
but his eight-year-old son didn't survive the assault.

114
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:05,756
Min was intoxicated by drugs at the time and...

115
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:10,626
A few days later,

116
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,155
I learned that a drugged up father killed his son.

117
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:15,966
I checked the date,

118
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:17,966
and it turned out to be the day...

119
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,096
that I delivered the drugs.

120
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:25,905
The outcome was horrific, and I was terrified.

121
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:30,775
It's when I finally came to my senses.

122
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,145
If I had stopped him, if I had reported him...

123
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,155
The boy died because of me.

124
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,385
That's why I'm as good as a murderer.

125
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,996
What led to your own death?

126
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,336
On my way to turn myself in to the police,

127
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,435
I went to see Pil Joong to persuade him as well.

128
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,706
That's when he stabbed me.

129
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,675
Do you believe your death washes away your guilt?

130
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,346
No.

131
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:09,815
It's not like my death brought the boy back to life.

132
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,756
But there's no way to get my story out to the world,

133
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:14,986
and I can't take any of it back.

134
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,626
Dying and living with eternal guilt.

135
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,226
I suppose that's my punishment.

136
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,635
Not everyone feels guilty when they die.

137
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,876
Some don't even feel an ounce of guilt until they breathe their last.

138
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:42,915
My mother...

139
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,456
passed away in the hospital.

140
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:47,856
Before I died, thankfully.

141
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:52,356
I'm such a pathetic son, aren't I?

142
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,326
You know that?

143
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:01,065
I couldn't say anything to you until now because I know that.

144
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,165
Because I was too embarrassed.

145
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,736
Then why are you telling me this now?

146
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,076
Confide in me whenever you feel judged or wronged.

147
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:11,145
It doesn't even have to be me.

148
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:15,645
Talk to whoever it is that you can trust and rely on.

149
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:19,356
Just because.

150
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:20,956
Then...

151
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:24,226
did you go to the club to find that jerk?

152
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,795
I tracked him down a while ago.

153
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,696
I happened to see Detective Ko while going after Pil Joong.

154
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,996
Detective Ko told me...

155
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:33,065
that Goliath was the one who gave all the orders.

156
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,265
Does that mean he is Goliath's minion too?

157
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,305
Goliath's minion?

158
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,876
Pil Joong is the Goliath.

159
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,736
Throw your phone away and go into hiding for the time being.

160
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,366
Do it now.

161
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:16,746
So you're saying...

162
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:20,616
Goliath or whatever he's called... He killed you,

163
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:24,716
kidnapped Se Young, and even killed Detective Ko?

164
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,415
- Yes. - You know where he lives, right?

165
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,885
He stays at hotels.

166
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,795
Don't tell me you'll go to where he is.

167
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,295
Why would I go there myself?

168
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:35,866
I should call the police.

169
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,895
But you know, in the room earlier...

170
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:39,996
Wait!

171
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:43,706
Don't move.

172
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,905
What? Who?

173
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:49,006
Me? Why?

174
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:54,216
He's here, right?

175
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:56,645
Is he here?

176
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,216
Jjonga, what's with you? You're scaring me.

177
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,185
I know he's here.

178
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,996
Hey, who? What are you talking about?

179
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:07,425
Mr. Oh Il Yong!

180
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:14,065
Wook told you everything, right?

181
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,606
I found that detective's address.

182
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:20,275
I'm not bragging, but I'm pretty good.

183
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:21,775
I'm good at tracking down people...

184
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,606
and finding things that people hid.

185
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,446
- Hey, Jjonga. - In any case,

186
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:30,586
I know you're running around, but I'm working hard too.

187
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:33,086
So let's compete fair and square.

188
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:35,956
Here.

189
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,425
We must find everyone who feels wronged.

190
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:39,696
Right, Mr. Oh?

191
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:44,466
He's not there.

192
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,236
What? Not here?

193
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:48,866
Okay, here!

194
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,775
He's not there either.

195
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,405
Really?

196
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:58,675
Here.

197
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,515
What an interesting family.

198
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,226
Il Yong just held your hand.

199
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,165
Really?

200
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:23,805
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Oh.

201
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,376
The pleasure is mine.

202
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,045
- Move in! - Yes, sir.

203
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,446
- Search the left side. - Yes, sir.

204
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,756
Darn it.

205
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:40,256
Where is he?

206
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:47,626
- Come on! - Let's go.

207
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:52,996
- Hey. - Let go!

208
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,635
What is this about?

209
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:57,065
You're under arrest for violating drug laws.

210
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,305
They're totally passed out.

211
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,076
- Wake them up. - Yes, sir.

212
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:22,126
- Hello. - Hello.

213
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,196
Please turn off the engine.

214
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:25,336
Stay where you are, please.

215
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,905
Gwang Taek, let's not make it harder than it has to be.

216
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:39,545
- Let go! - Stay put.

217
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,746
Get off me!

218
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,815
Last night, the police carried out an operation...

219
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:45,486
to arrest the largest drug trafficking ring in the country.

220
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,956
They used chat rooms on various social media platforms...

221
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:51,256
to distribute drugs nationwide...

222
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:54,055
and are also suspected of committing other crimes...

223
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:55,726
- Get started. - Yes, sir.

224
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:59,265
Goliath, the ringleader, is a man in his 20s.

225
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:02,765
He has gone into hiding to evade the police.

226
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,035
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

227
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,135
Hey, I saw the news.

228
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,336
I heard you rounded them all up.

229
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,545
Gosh, don't even get me started.

230
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:13,246
Even if we catch 100 small fish, we can't get rid of junkies.

231
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:16,785
It's not like we couldn't catch them for the past six months.

232
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:20,456
We were setting traps to catch the ringleader. Darn it.

233
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:22,285
We lost Goliath.

234
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,086
Oh, right. Have you heard from Sang Chul?

235
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,456
Well, Detective Shin is working hard to find him.

236
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,665
Yes, I'll be in touch.

237
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:31,696
All right.

238
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,496
Hey, that was Captain Lee.

239
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,435
Yes. I'm off to meet the witness.

240
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:38,606
Witness? They saw Sang Chul?

241
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,476
Well, I shall go find out.

242
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:41,506
See you.

243
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:42,805
Jun Ho.

244
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,405
- Shall I come with you? - No, I'll just go alone.

245
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:46,376
- Come on. We're a team. - It's fine.

246
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,315
Hey, have you finished your report yet?

247
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:50,216
Not yet, right? Finish that first.

248
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:51,545
You always slack off like this.

249
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,315
I'm off.

250
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:00,226
I gave you the name and the hotel room number as well.

251
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:01,425
I can't believe you lost him.

252
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:04,065
I told you that he killed Il Yong and Detective Ko.

253
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,236
And he was the one who abducted Se Young.

254
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:07,935
Goodness.

255
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:11,405
The Drug Squad raided his room, but he was already gone.

256
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,746
Can you find out if there's a place where Kim Pil Joong frequents...

257
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,145
or anywhere else where he could be?

258
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:20,246
Could you ask him?

259
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,346
Kim Pil Joong stays at hotels, so he doesn't know where his home is.

260
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,616
Who knew?

261
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:29,256
That you'd ask a ghost for a favor.

262
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,925
I'm asking you, not a ghost.

263
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,626
Finally, you admit that I'm good at this.

264
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:39,795
Anyway, where are we going?

265
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:43,466
To find the car that you mentioned.

266
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,476
Detective Ko's car?

(Office)

268
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,706
- That black car over there. - Yes, thank you.

00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,686
(Junkyard)

270
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,115
Is this it?

271
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:02,825
Check the backseat.

272
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:42,396
So this is the syringe he used on Choi Jung A?

273
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,545
No, stay back.

274
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,916
This is a crime scene now.

275
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,115
The forensics team will be here shortly.

276
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:08,515
- Don't touch the evidence vehicle. - Okay.

277
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,055
"Evidence vehicle."

278
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,256
This is why I said we should come here together.

279
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,166
What do you mean?

280
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,865
You find evidence like a psychic would.

281
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,065
It looks suspicious.

282
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,335
Suspicious? Why?

283
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:24,906
I heard it from someone directly involved in this.

284
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:27,805
Right. You said that person was dead.

285
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:30,976
You heard it from the dead guy.

286
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:33,345
That's right.

287
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:36,746
But shouldn't you be used to it by now?

288
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:39,055
I guess. But everyone else will...

289
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:41,815
Forget it.

290
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,496
I said I was fine being home alone.

291
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:49,496
I'd be worried if you were left home alone.

292
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,166
You can study at a cafe.

293
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,535
White noise can help you focus.

294
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,035
You treat me like a little kid.

295
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,666
You take me to school and come to pick me up.

296
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,075
We met under special circumstances, you know.

297
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,075
Yes, I'm grateful to you.

298
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:08,785
Let's go.

299
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:12,756
We've tracked down the culprit and found the syringe too,

300
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:15,156
so that detective can leave soon.

301
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,285
But we haven't found Detective Ko's body yet.

302
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:22,926
We need to find proof he's dead, but it doesn't seem too easy.

303
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:24,726
They lost Goliath.

304
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,736
He's a little rat.

305
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:29,406
A total expert at getting away and disappearing.

306
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:32,236
Do you really not know where he could be?

307
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,446
He'll have gotten far away by now.

308
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,875
You said you were friends.

309
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:39,015
What friend stabs another?

310
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:41,815
You should've befriended nicer people.

311
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,815
I regret that even in death, okay?

312
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,956
Good for you.

313
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:47,615
You never stop talking back, do you?

314
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:52,095
I know I'm not in the right.

315
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,055
I'm glad you know.

316
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:58,365
You can take this with you.

317
00:20:58,365 --> 00:20:59,666
Let me take that.

318
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,305
It's so nice to have more young men around.

319
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,575
Not all young men are the same.

320
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:07,906
I'm worth a hundred.

321
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:09,506
Then you carry this.

322
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:11,406
Let's not keep the kids waiting.

323
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:14,416
What? Wait for me.

324
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,115
- Gosh. - Watch your step.

325
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:24,886
They squabble then giggle just like real brothers.

326
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:27,095
It's nice to see.

327
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:29,666
Oh, well.

328
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:35,636
Shall I make some jeon with the old pumpkin?

329
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:38,636
Oh, this should do just fine.

330
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:42,845
What? Did you forget something?

331
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,916
What?

332
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:53,615
Was it the wind?

333
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:00,398
Pull your knee up and keep your chin down.

334
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,309
- We won. - Our team won.

335
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,539
Don't stick out your stomach.

336
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,549
"Onto a soft slice of bread,"

337
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,878
"spread some strawberry jam."

338
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,589
"Don't you forget a slice of savory ham."

339
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,989
Detective Ko, how are things?

340
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,658
It took you this long to get some snacks?

341
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:25,829
You left all these kids to me and...

342
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:32,029
Oh, Mr. Jung. Alice.

343
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,799
The snacks are here.

344
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,348
Gosh.

345
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,418
What is it?

346
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,989
Take a look, Ms. An.

347
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,989
The yellow bits here.

348
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,489
What do they look like?

349
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,529
These things here look like tree trunks.

350
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:04,729
I don't know what the yellow parts are.

351
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:08,569
If you look at this drawing, it looks like the yellow thing...

352
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,309
is hidden by the trees.

353
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,239
This is all so frustrating.

354
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,479
Do you think we could ask Ro Ha about it?

355
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:21,378
Well...

356
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,489
Not if it's not good for the kid.

357
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,489
Will they be here soon?

358
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:31,688
- Yes. - I should go, then.

359
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:33,198
- Okay. - Bye.

360
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:40,438
Why are there no customers?

361
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:42,969
Welcome!

362
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,208
Hello, my friend.

363
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:51,148
Seul Gi, shouldn't you be at work?

364
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:52,579
She quit.

365
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,719
You won't even ask how I'm doing because I'm jobless?

366
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,418
- You quit? - Yes.

367
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:59,388
What happened to Jung A made me think life's futile.

368
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,319
I lived and worked too hard.

369
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,229
I want to take things easy now.

370
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:06,658
What a lovely place.

371
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,729
What's the concept?

372
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:12,598
There's nothing nearby. I thought I'd taken a wrong turn.

373
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,739
It looks like this now, but it'll become a hot spot soon.

374
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,668
Cafes with an industrial look will line the alley, okay?

375
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,979
It's the hottest place you can be at.

376
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:22,079
- It is? - Yes.

377
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,348
Why is it empty, then?

378
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,979
Did you promote the place? Host an opening event?

379
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,648
An opening event?

380
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:31,219
Jong A, I'll go outside and check on the dogs.

381
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,219
Okay.

382
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:37,658
Who's that? A part-timer?

383
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:39,858
No, a kid I know.

384
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,398
Don't you have a barista license?

385
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,469
- I do. - Do you want to work here?

386
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:45,938
I'd love to.

387
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:47,969
Jong A, her and not me?

388
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:50,438
She said she wants to take things slow.

389
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,408
I'm jobless now but I give everything my all.

390
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,608
Forget it. Shall we talk over coffee?

391
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,479
- Sounds good. - Pick everything you want.

392
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,708
Everything's free today.

393
00:24:58,049 --> 00:24:59,918
Everything's free? Really?

394
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:02,688
Then I'll have three pieces of cake,

395
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:05,089
and this iced frappuccino with fresh cream,

396
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:08,658
dolce caramel syrup, mint choc chip and AA Kenya blended coffee.

397
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,858
- Did you hear... - You can have anything.

398
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,529
- Jong A? - Yes?

399
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:16,499
Where's Jjamppong?

400
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:20,739
Jjamppong.

401
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,368
Jjamppong.

402
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,208
Where'd he go?

403
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,249
(Safety First)

404
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,648
Doggy.

405
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:15,089
Doggy.

406
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,898
Hey, have you seen Alice?

407
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,969
All the others went back to class,

408
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,138
but I can't find Alice.

409
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,579
She was here a while ago.

410
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,839
- Where'd she go? - Is she in the back yard?

411
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,049
I'll see if she is.

412
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:39,948
- I'll walk around the school. - Okay.

413
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:42,049
Detective Ko, go that way.

414
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,319
I'll search the school again.

415
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:45,519
Okay.

416
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,789
Alice!

417
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,928
What are you doing on your own?

418
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:57,668
Hey.

419
00:26:58,168 --> 00:27:00,339
There's a puppy too?

420
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:02,138
Goodness.

421
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,339
Let me have a look.

422
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:08,739
Jjamppong?

423
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,779
Are you dead?

424
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,249
Alice, where did you find him?

425
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:18,989
Was he by the tree?

426
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:20,019
No.

427
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,858
He came from that way.

428
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:26,128
Okay, from that way?

429
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:28,999
Alice!

430
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:30,729
Goodness.

431
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:34,739
What were you shouting about? Get your breath back.

432
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,539
Did you bring her here?

433
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,569
No, I met her on the road.

434
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:40,208
She was playing with Jjamppong.

435
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,938
What would Jjamppong be doing here?

436
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,378
He should be at home.

437
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:44,448
Look.

438
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:48,178
It looks a lot like... Jjamppong!

439
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,489
- Are you dead? - No, I don't think so.

440
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,759
Alice said he came from that way.

441
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:04,668
On its own? What about Janggoon and Munggoon?

442
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:06,499
I don't see them. I guess he came on his own.

443
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:16,079
Ro Ha, have you been here before?

444
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:17,979
Yes.

445
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,219
Who did you go with?

446
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,749
Mom had gone so I went on my own.

447
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,118
I see.

448
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:29,759
There are so many trees here.

449
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,198
What's this?

450
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:39,499
I don't know.

451
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,269
Was this beside a tree?

452
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:47,009
Yes.

453
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,049
Okay.

454
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:55,918
- You can't just run off. - Jjamppong.

455
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,989
Jjamppong.

456
00:28:58,749 --> 00:28:59,918
Bo Ra.

457
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:01,188
Jjamppong.

458
00:29:02,928 --> 00:29:04,259
Jjamppong.

459
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,799
I looked for you everywhere.

460
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:08,799
Where did you find him?

461
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,198
I found him up there on his own,

462
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:12,898
so I brought him with me.

463
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,198
I see you were very worried. Let's go inside.

464
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:18,509
My heart sank. I thought he'd disappeared again.

465
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:20,638
"Again?"

466
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,009
Jjamppong went missing before?

467
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,079
No, that's not it.

468
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:30,789
I was suddenly reminded of my mom. It frightened me to death.

469
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,019
I see.

470
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,259
Hello.

471
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,658
Hi. Did the results come out?

472
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,999
Not yet. I got a call and arrived here just now.

473
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,069
How did you know...

474
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,069
about the syringe hidden underneath the back seat?

475
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:51,938
I would've hidden it there had it been me.

476
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,438
So I checked just in case.

477
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,438
Oh, really?

478
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,479
That's smart.

479
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,249
- Hi. - Hello.

480
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:02,319
You have the results?

481
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:04,019
During Choi Jung A's autopsy,

482
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,059
methamphetamine and zolpidem were found from her body.

483
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:09,858
The syringe also had zolpidem in its inner side.

484
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:11,789
Any DNAs?

485
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,529
Choi Jung A's blood was found from the needle.

486
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,898
And it corresponds with the mark on her neck.

487
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,398
In conclusion,

488
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,739
this very syringe was used on Choi Jung A.

489
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:24,969
Any traces of other people?

490
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,739
Like fingerprints or hair.

491
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:28,878
- No. - Lee Gwang Taek did it.

492
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:30,479
And Detective Ko hid the evidence.

493
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:32,648
How can we prove it?

494
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:34,848
Shin Jun Ho.

495
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,448
Did you know Lee Gwang Taek?

496
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:41,358
I told you about coming to see him once before.

497
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:43,888
He had a terrible impression.

498
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:46,299
He used to go around with Detective Ko,

499
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,428
so they must've kidnapped and murdered Choi Jung A together.

500
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:49,628
Maybe that jerk killed her...

501
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:52,098
and Detective Ko hid the syringe.

502
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,908
Yes, maybe.

503
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,479
(Authorized Personnel Only)

504
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,509
Sir, let me talk to Lee Gwang Taek in person.

505
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:04,509
You?

506
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,918
The investigation isn't over yet.

507
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:09,378
And you know my team hates you.

508
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:11,618
But Detective Ko must be found as soon as possible.

509
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:13,559
Is he in the detention center?

510
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:16,858
Goodness.

511
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,069
Go on.

512
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,928
(Class Sun)

513
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,438
What are you doing?

514
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:34,979
What's up?

515
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:38,208
I placed last in running again.

516
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,678
I want to place first too.

517
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:43,148
I see.

518
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,118
It's all right.

519
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,259
Who cares if it's not the first place?

520
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,958
Everyone knows that you did your best.

521
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,858
Are you telling me to place last all the time?

522
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,658
I want to place first too!

523
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,898
That's not what I mean...

524
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:09,579
I never told you to place last.

525
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:17,289
Lee Jin Sung was sent to jail...

526
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:20,719
for accidental homicide in February 2013.

527
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:23,188
And after a month in March 2013,

528
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,458
his wife, Ko Eun Jung, visited him.

529
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,598
Until then, she was with their son, Ro Ha, right?

530
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,729
When was she admitted to the mental hospital?

531
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,938
November 2014.

532
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,239
Did you check the history of her health insurance payments?

533
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:36,938
The payments haven't been made for eight years.

534
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,239
Really?

535
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,608
I knew it.

536
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:47,178
A total of 26 patients are staying in this hospital...

537
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,378
without making their payments.

538
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:52,958
We can't kick patients out just because they have no money.

539
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,819
The government gives you almost 70,000 dollars a month thanks to it.

540
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:58,688
That's hardly enough to run this hospital.

541
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,059
In 2013,

542
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:02,698
you were funded almost 200,000 dollars a month.

543
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:06,168
At that time, there were many cases of hiring brokers...

544
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,299
to force patients into getting admitted.

545
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,138
We've never done such a thing!

546
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,769
Yes, of course.

547
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,339
We even requested a warrant...

548
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,178
to look through your ten-year ledger.

549
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,319
Hey, where did you take Ko Eun Jung?

550
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,118
Okay, bye.

551
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,489
The ambulance service that took her doesn't exist anymore.

552
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:33,098
They deleted all the records before the inspection.

553
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:35,428
Those darn scumbags.

554
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,499
Hello.

555
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:42,239
Do you know these people?

556
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,608
I don't recognize them.

557
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,608
No.

558
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:51,578
Hello.

559
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:54,748
- Gosh, food is here. - Good afternoon.

560
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,219
You must be hungry.

561
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:58,148
- Wait just a bit. - Sure.

562
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,119
- He's here with food. - Goodness.

563
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:04,058
- Give me a lot. - Here you go.

564
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:05,929
- Okay, I will. - Give me a lot.

565
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:08,299
- Here. I'll give you a lot. - Gosh.

566
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:15,938
These are Ro Ha's shoes.

567
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,938
Yes, Ro Ha came in those.

568
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,938
They were so worn out that I got him a new pair...

569
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,179
and stored them here.

570
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:26,148
He must've suffered so much.

571
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,279
How did he come here?

572
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,918
He lost his mom.

573
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,719
He went to the mountain to find her and got lost.

574
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,288
That's how he ended up here.

575
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:38,058
He doesn't remember what he went through.

576
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:39,799
But look.

577
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:41,998
It's all written on his shoes.

578
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:32,578
I feel a sense of fear in this drawing.

579
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:36,119
It must be a place in his memory.

580
00:36:00,078 --> 00:36:01,139
Ro Ha.

581
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:03,909
Were you here?

582
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:10,719
Hey, place them straight in line.

583
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,418
Hold tightly.

584
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:15,958
I did this so many times when I went to school.

585
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,858
They're going sideways.

586
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,328
Gosh.

587
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:22,898
No, to the left.

588
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:25,469
I mean, to the right from where you are.

589
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:27,869
Hey!

590
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:30,009
Goodness.

591
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:32,168
I told you to place them...

592
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:35,339
Never mind. I'll do it.

593
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:40,378
Where did Detective Ko go, leaving this to me?

594
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:44,889
Well,

595
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:49,589
I hear your drawing skills are better than all the kids here.

596
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:52,159
I'm poor at it, you know.

597
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:57,168
How about I tell you a secret?

598
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,438
The truth is,

599
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,378
I'm a crybaby.

600
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,779
But you're a detective. How can a detective be a crybaby?

601
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,679
Quiet down. I told you it was a secret.

602
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:17,119
But detectives are brave.

603
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,148
Right.

604
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,489
Detectives are brave.

605
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:24,228
Guess what I did to be brave.

606
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,038
I held this tightly and thought to myself.

607
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,099
"I'm not a crybaby."

608
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:38,569
"I am not a crybaby."

609
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:41,538
Guess what happened then.

610
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,108
What happened?

611
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:48,719
I became brave for real.

612
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:52,819
You're lying.

613
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:55,358
I'm not. Detectives can't lie.

614
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,889
Look. It's a police medal.

615
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:01,828
You're right. It's a police gold medal.

616
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:04,228
Right? This is my treasure.

617
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,498
I'll give it to you.

618
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:10,768
Here.

619
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:13,509
When you run tomorrow, hold this tightly...

620
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,208
and think to yourself.

621
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:18,779
"I'm the 1st-place winner. I will place 1st."

622
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:22,779
Will I be able to place first for real then?

623
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:25,589
Yes.

624
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:28,918
Mr. Jung.

625
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,188
Where is Ms. An?

626
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:33,429
She went to the Teachers' Room to get the flags.

627
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:34,529
Okay.

628
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,668
Ms. An, give me these...

629
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,369
and show me Ro Ha's drawing.

630
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:41,639
- Sure. - Thanks.

631
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,808
He certainly went to the mountain...

632
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,739
and saw trees.

633
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,478
He did see this thing, right?

634
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:55,918
Yes, he saw something next to the trees,

635
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,489
but he didn't know what it was.

636
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,418
I went to so many mountains in the country...

637
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:03,358
for more than 15 years to find my daughter.

638
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:07,498
Each time, I felt resentful that the mountains were...

639
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:09,728
too high and steep.

640
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:11,099
But the mountains weren't to blame.

641
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,799
It was only because of my anxiety.

642
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:15,299
It must've been the same for Ro Ha.

643
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:20,878
That little kid was terrified to be lost in the woods.

644
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:24,308
It showed in his drawings.

645
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:28,418
That's right. But we missed one thing.

646
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,918
The tree must've seemed ten times bigger in his eyes.

647
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,389
To draw all of it,

648
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,628
he needed more than a single sheet of paper.

649
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:45,469
Are you saying that all of these...

650
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:54,038
Here. This is what Ro Ha saw that day.

651
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:04,188
This was it.

652
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:09,219
There may be nothing I can do now,

653
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,788
but I still want to know...

654
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,699
where Hyun Ji went and what she saw.

655
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:17,799
It's the same with Ro Ha.

656
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:22,339
The foolish grown-ups couldn't protect them,

657
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:26,268
but we should find out what happened to them.

658
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:28,108
It's the least I can do.

659
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:30,108
The kids here...

660
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,978
are all like Hyun Ji to me in a way.

661
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:42,989
Goodness, are you making kimchi for the winter?

662
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:44,989
This is a lot of seasoning.

663
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:47,659
Look at how many people we have in the village.

664
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:50,869
Even spirits and ghosts appreciate feasts.

665
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:52,268
But you also made rice cakes.

666
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:55,639
And I saw a heap of glass noodles for the japchae.

667
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,639
Il Yong, is the cabbage ready?

668
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,308
I'm coming!

669
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,279
The people here only look good thanks to your cooking.

670
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:05,378
As long as you're aware of that. Hand me more chili powder.

671
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:07,819
Here you go.

672
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:09,518
- Leave the pile there. - Right.

673
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:11,619
- Hand over a cabbage one at a time. - Sure.

674
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,759
Here we go. One by one.

675
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,589
Detective Ko, I never assumed you'd be a slacker.

676
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,898
You disappeared from the playground earlier.

677
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,569
It was to help Ro Ha.

678
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:26,599
What about him?

679
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,969
I promised him...

680
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,108
that he'd win the race tomorrow,

681
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:33,268
but he's the slowest runner.

682
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:35,509
But you can't say things that you don't mean.

683
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:36,578
Why did you do that?

684
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,779
Because he badly desired it.

685
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:41,619
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

686
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:46,819
Gosh. Detective Ko, you have finally matured.

687
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,319
Don't worry though.

688
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,728
I'll make sure his wish comes true.

689
00:41:51,728 --> 00:41:54,259
He will win the race tomorrow.

690
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,069
How will you manage that?

691
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,208
Goodness, stop. That's enough.

692
00:42:08,478 --> 00:42:11,409
I saw you two below the underpass.

693
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:13,179
- Right. - Gosh.

694
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,918
We're looking for a boy...

695
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:19,219
who lived there with his mom eight years ago.

696
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:22,089
No one seems to remember him though.

697
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:24,128
I hear you've been volunteering there...

698
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:25,728
for over ten years.

699
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:27,498
I wouldn't call it community service.

700
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:30,628
All I do is share some leftover food.

701
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:33,639
Sir, by any chance,

702
00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:37,339
do you remember these two?

703
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:39,909
Wait.

704
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,409
- I do. - What?

705
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:45,248
Hang on a second.

706
00:42:53,248 --> 00:42:57,029
This is what the boy drew for me.

707
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:01,799
It looks like you.

708
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,199
I see that your hair was black back then.

709
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:08,739
Has it been that long?

710
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:16,679
I met them for the first time below that underpass.

711
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,648
The boy seemed so hungry...

712
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:23,889
that I invited him over for a meal at my diner.

713
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:33,728
- Is it good? - Yes.

714
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:36,969
- Dig in. - Thank you.

715
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,128
Here.

716
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:45,369
Goodness. How did you injure your arm?

717
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:48,538
While working at the construction site.

718
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:51,179
I'm still getting the hang of things.

719
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:11,199
And then about a month later,

720
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:14,038
her state had worsened,

721
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,268
and she was living on the streets with the boy.

722
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:20,308
You should've seen how much she cared for him.

723
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:21,378
Gosh.

724
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:22,578
Dig in.

725
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:26,549
Thank you so much.

726
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,619
I saw them having lunch that afternoon,

727
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:33,589
but they were gone when I returned the next day.

728
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:37,228
An ambulance picked her up that morning.

729
00:44:38,128 --> 00:44:40,058
I asked if the boy went with her,

730
00:44:40,328 --> 00:44:41,699
but people told me...

731
00:44:42,398 --> 00:44:45,398
that the boy chased after the ambulance in tears.

732
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:48,099
I haven't seen them since.

733
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,108
I went by the spring in the woods just in case, but...

734
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,139
Hold on a second.

735
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:56,839
The woods as in Mt. Cheonjung?

736
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:00,349
Why there?

737
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:05,049
That's where the mom would take her boy for a hike.

738
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:07,659
(Cheonjung)

739
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:13,589
Wait!

740
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:17,898
Here it is. This is the one.

741
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,369
- Is that the one? - Yes, this one.

742
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:23,438
All the mornings you spent hiking up mountains...

743
00:45:23,438 --> 00:45:25,168
finally paid off!

744
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:27,438
No, it's not that.

745
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:31,549
Ro Ha had dropped a clue which I only just figured out.

746
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:35,449
- I found it. - What?

747
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:38,719
Watch.

748
00:45:39,788 --> 00:45:40,788
(Republic of Korea)

749
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:44,228
The sign that Ro Ha drew can be found in 13 mountains.

750
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:45,529
Nine of them...

751
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:47,858
were placed within seven years, so that rules them out.

752
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:49,159
(Seoul, Republic of Korea, Daejeon)

753
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,969
That leaves us with these four.

754
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:54,239
Mt. Daebong was caught on fire eight years ago,

755
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:55,839
and the hiking trail was closed off.

756
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:58,268
And that mountain is on an island...

757
00:45:58,268 --> 00:45:59,938
that you must take a three-hour boat ride to reach.

758
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,139
(Mt. Gangam, Mt. Cheonjung)

759
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,639
By process of elimination,

760
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,179
the one with the higher probability...

761
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:07,319
(Mt. Cheonjung)

762
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:08,319
It's this one.

763
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,319
Mt. Cheonjung?

764
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,840
(Mt. Cheonjung)

765
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,470
Hurry, will you?

766
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:22,340
This is the one. 1-1.

767
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,149
It looks just like the one Ro Ha drew.

768
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,379
Hurry up, will you?

769
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:28,280
We have a long way to go until 1-8.

770
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,450
Yes, we should hurry.

771
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,249
Wook, this isn't a day to dawdle.

772
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:34,419
- Mr. Jang. - What?

773
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,860
- Gosh. - He sounds familiar.

774
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,329
Mr. Jang, isn't that you?

775
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:39,559
Goodness, Detective Baek.

776
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:41,760
What brings you here at the crack of dawn?

777
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,860
Hello.

778
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,229
- Hello. - Hey.

779
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:45,999
As if you need to ask.

780
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:48,439
My job is to find people, and that's what I'm here to do.

781
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,910
I went below the underpass nearby to ask some questions yesterday.

782
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,470
After getting shut-eye,

783
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,240
I came up here to canvas the area.

784
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:56,309
So...

785
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,879
(Current location)

786
00:46:58,879 --> 00:46:59,879
Hold on a second.

787
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,849
The fact that all three of you are here...

788
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,289
I had them join me on my hike.

789
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,320
They're too feeble for their age.

790
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,760
I can't believe you woke us up this early for a hike though.

791
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,829
Unbelievable.

792
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:16,260
Detective, who are you looking for?

793
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:19,769
A boy that went missing eight years ago.

794
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:22,640
His dad was incarcerated and was only released last week.

795
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,140
He filed a report.

796
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:29,740
This is great. I had information to relay.

797
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,709
- Information? - Yes.

798
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,379
Ever since I met Mr. Jang,

799
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:36,649
I've been taking interest in missing children.

800
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:39,490
I joined an online community and have been doing volunteer work.

801
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,689
From what I gathered, many children go missing...

802
00:47:41,689 --> 00:47:44,689
as a result of tripping and falling in the woods.

803
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:46,590
Here at Mt. Cheonjung,

804
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:50,930
there's a cliff right behind the 1-8 location sign...

805
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,669
which is said to be hazardous.

806
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,970
Right here. Location 1-8.

807
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,399
I see.

808
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:58,840
- Location 1-8. - Right.

809
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,939
Location 1-8.

810
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:05,280
- It sounds convincing. - Right?

811
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:07,780
Would you like to come with us?

812
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,120
We were on our way up there.

813
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:10,919
- What? - It won't take long.

814
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:12,789
No, it's all right.

815
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:15,620
A team is on its way with search-and-rescue dogs.

816
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,189
So don't worry about the search and be on your way.

817
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,660
Is that so? Then I'll get going.

818
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,860
Let's go, Wook. Ms. Lee, you too.

819
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,499
Come on. Let's go.

820
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:27,999
- Wait, but... - Let's go.

821
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,740
- But we came all the way here. - Say bye to the detective.

822
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,840
Bye, take it easy!

823
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,140
Detective, will you bring a drone too?

824
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,709
- It's 1-8... - Come on. Let's go.

825
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,039
Bye.

826
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,039
It's very dangerous.

827
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,079
Okay, 1-8.

828
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,249
Another psychic moment, I guess.

829
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,519
The cliff by the sign that says "1-8."

830
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,260
The 10,896th day.

831
00:48:58,899 --> 00:49:01,470
Today is the field day.

832
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,570
Oh, boy.

833
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,999
Are we too serious about a kids' field day?

834
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,379
Why are you two so dressed up?

835
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,979
We're not dressed up.

836
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:17,910
It's because I've got a nice body.

837
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,749
Hey, Detective Ko.

838
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:23,849
What happened to your face? You look very tired.

839
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,090
I was nervous, so I couldn't sleep well last night.

840
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,860
We shouldn't have to worry about the running race, right?

841
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,160
Come on. I'm Kim Wook.

842
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,970
I can do whatever I set my mind to.

843
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
Did you guys have a hearty breakfast?

844
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,470
No, we didn't have breakfast.

845
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,010
You made so much food. We have to finish everything.

846
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:48,010
Oh, that's right. We shall eat until we die.

847
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,379
Die again?

848
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,309
Hey, you still can't get used to it?

849
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:54,979
Come on, Detective Ko.

850
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:57,689
Don't be so square.

851
00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:00,620
I'm not. I was just kidding.

852
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,760
Let's hurry. The kids must be waiting.

853
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,189
Yes, come along!

854
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:05,729
- Okay. - Let's go.

855
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,430
Let's go!

856
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,729
Hurry, guys.

857
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:11,030
On your way up... Don't worry about anything else.

858
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,700
You'll see a sign that says "1-8."

859
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,300
That's where we'll begin our search, okay?

860
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,300
- Got it? - Yes, sir.

861
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,110
- Let's go. - Come on, guys.

862
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,110
Hey.

863
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:20,879
What's going on?

864
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:22,209
Remember Lee Ro Ha?

865
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:24,379
The boy who was reported missing a few days ago.

866
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:26,809
Right, his father filed the report upon his release from jail.

867
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:27,879
That's right.

868
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:30,220
A witness saw him eight years ago, so we're searching the area.

869
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,689
Was he kidnapped and murdered?

870
00:51:34,189 --> 00:51:36,789
No, he lost his footing and fell.

871
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,829
At the moment, it's just a speculation.

872
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,129
But we received a credible tip.

873
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,099
Detective Shin, monitor the drones.

874
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,200
We'll search the entire mountain without dividing it up?

875
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,240
First, find the sign that says "1-8."

876
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,510
There's a cliff just a little north of it.

877
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,910
It's that spot right there.

878
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,249
That's where we'll begin our search.

879
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,249
Let's go.

880
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,280
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

881
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:07,919
All right.

882
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:12,789
The Industrial Complex Three field day begins now!

883
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,510
- Yes! - Go!

884
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,910
- Go, Team White! - Go, Team Blue!

885
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:28,979
- That's it! - Team White!

886
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:31,809
Get your rice cake here and go that way.

887
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:33,249
Over there, where she's standing.

888
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,620
Well done! Run!

889
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,379
- Go, hurry. - Go!

890
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:39,689
- Hey! - Team White!

891
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,459
Can I have another one?

892
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:44,829
What? No, you can't.

893
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,129
Go on. Hurry.

894
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,899
- No. - Team White!

895
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,970
- Go, Team White! - Come on!

896
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,200
Show me the stamp later, and you'll get a prize.

897
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,539
Thank you.

898
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,740
The prizes look amazing.

899
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,910
- Thank you! - Go on.

900
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,510
There are so many prizes.

901
00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:07,720
Oh, I want the stamp too.

902
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,689
You get the participation prize.

903
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,760
I don't know what the prize is, but I'm already excited.

904
00:53:17,189 --> 00:53:19,490
Everyone at school is getting a prize anyway.

905
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,959
Why did you make them do so many running drills?

906
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,430
Gosh.

907
00:53:23,629 --> 00:53:27,530
This way, the kids can learn to dream too...

908
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,439
and set goals again.

909
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,570
That's nice...

910
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,680
but sad at the same time.

911
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,550
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

912
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,720
For teaching the kids to dream again.

913
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,729
- Go! - Go, team!

914

Go! Win!

Don't throw it at me! Aim higher!

- Yes! - We did it!

It's a happy day. Why are you crying?

I'm crying because I'm so happy.

Gosh, if they were alive...

Young Rim and Ha Yoon would be 22 years old.

I don't know. I don't even want to talk about my age.

I feel the same way.

From time to time,

I feel that being frozen in time like this isn't a bad thing.

Look at that.

Flowers are in full bloom in the schoolyard.

What's the use?

Their stems were cut. That's why those pretty flowers ended up here.

I wonder if this is paradise.

They say, "There is no paradise where there are no kids."

00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,999
- No... - That's it!

983
00:59:01,999 --> 00:59:04,099
Oh, dear. Ro Ha!

984
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:07,209
Yes. Keep going. Go on.

985
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,309
Ro Ha.

986
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,809
Why do you want to run the fastest?

987
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,720
So I can go to Mom.

988
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,149
Where is she?

989
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:23,689
I don't know. She left in an ambulance.

990
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,629
I was too slow a runner,

991
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,860
so I lost her after a while.

992
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:31,970
I see.

993
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,740
Ro Ha, that wasn't because...

994
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,240
you ran too slowly.

995
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,050
The ambulance was too fast.

996
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,919
I just have to run faster than a car.

997
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,820
And catch up to where Mom is.

998
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,329
Uncle, if I come first in the race,

999
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:04,229
that means I run faster than a car, doesn't it?

1000
01:00:05,729 --> 01:00:08,200
Yes, that's it! Keep going!

1001
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,840
Keep it up!

1002
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,340
Go on! Run faster!

1003
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,879
Ro Ha!

1004
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,649
Go! Don't stop!

1005
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:21,579
That's it! You're doing great!

1006
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,340
What?

1007
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,709
No way!

1008
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,820
My gosh.

1009
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,890
Wook, what did you do?

1010
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:03,959
Ro Ha's in first place.

1011
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:05,390
I told you not to worry.

1012
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,260
Ro Ha! Stay strong!

1013
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,360
Keep going, kids!

1014
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:12,169
Run!

1015
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,999
Good luck!

1016
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,439
Hey.

1017
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,979
Detectives Shin and Oh, get over here!

1018
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,249
- Okay! - What?

1019
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,220
Mom!

1020
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,559
Mom!

1021
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:39,559
Mom!

1022
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:42,030
Mom.

1023
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,660
Mom.

1024
01:01:46,899 --> 01:01:49,099
Mom...

1025
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,269
Mom.

1026
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,470
Keep going!

1027
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,740
Ro Ha! Keep going. Run faster.

1028
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,740
Run.

1029
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:26,539
Ro Ha!

1030
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,539
Run, Ro Ha. That's it, run!

1031
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:41,689
Yes!

1032
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:25,229
They found him.

1033
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,700
Thank you.

1034
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:32,240
Goodbye, Ro Ha.

1035
01:03:42,749 --> 01:03:44,849
Goodbye, Ro Ha.

1036
01:03:45,749 --> 01:03:49,160
Ro Ha. Bye.

1037
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,930
The lonely boy who came here eight years ago...

1038
01:03:58,399 --> 01:03:59,470
left...

1039
01:04:01,499 --> 01:04:04,200
while everyone applauded his win.

1040
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:27,729
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

1041
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,800
You can't drink banana milk!

1042
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,729
It has been 15 years already.

1043
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:34,570
You don't know who she is?

1044
01:04:34,899 --> 01:04:37,640
How are we to find someone who gave her banana milk?

1045
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,209
A thief broke in.

1046
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,709
They came back to terrorize the village.

1047
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:45,209
Did you see someone suspicious nearby?

1048
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,180
What did you say? Who's missing?

1049
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:48,919
Ha Yoon.

1050
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,620
We must find them,

1051
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,689
so they don't appear again.

1052
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,450
Who's there?
