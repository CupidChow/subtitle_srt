Get out of the car.

3
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,600
Hey, you. Get out of the car.

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,631
Hey!

5
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,771
Darn it.

6
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,581
You! Stop the car!

7
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,790
Darn it.

8
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,460
I didn't get the plate number.

9
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,750
It's 40G 1408.

10
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,822
Detective Shin, it's me.

11
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:23,292
I spotted Kim Pil Joong, but I lost him.

12
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,791
Right. It's 40... What was it again?

13
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,631
It's 40G 1408.

14
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:30,602
A dark gray SUV, plate number 40G 1408.

15
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,170
Put a BOLO out in and around Seoun-dong...

16
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,772
for a dark gray SUV with plate number 40G 1408.

17
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:39,242
Hello, have you been well?

18
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,712
Me? I arrived a little while ago.

19
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,081
My location?

20
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:49,151
I'm at...

21
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,592
I guess you can say we're under the same sky.

22
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,692
Shouldn't we get together?

23
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,401
Right.

24
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,301
Tomorrow?

25
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:07,602
Got it.

26
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,592
Where's Kim Pil Joong?

27
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,262
He swapped cars about ten minutes ago.

28
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,900
Detective Kim, gather camera footage around the area...

29
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,571
and install checkpoints within a 10km radius.

30
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:13,632
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:15,741
Il Yong.

32
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:21,941
The police went after him, so let's wait a few more minutes.

33
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:24,181
He was right in front of me, but I couldn't do anything.

34
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,711
What do you mean you didn't do anything?

35
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,122
You called out for me, and I went after him.

36
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,982
The police are searching,

37
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,753
so you did what you could.

38
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,392
Who cares? Let them watch.

39
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,033
I don't make things easy for you, do I?

40
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:47,332
Il Yong, did you go there...

41
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:50,343
knowing that Kim Pil Joong was there?

42
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:54,343
The neighborhood is where we both once lived.

43
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,042
He never returned after leaving...

44
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,612
saying that it was a dump.

45
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:01,523
I went there on a hunch to see if he was hiding there.

46
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:03,752
Has he been there all this time?

47
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,252
I don't think so.

48
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,653
I didn't see him when I went there a few days ago.

49
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,762
It seemed as if he was there to meet someone.

50
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,293
Who?

51
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:14,463
I don't know.

52
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,533
He seemed to be waiting for someone in the alley.

53
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,203
But he just left.

54
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,942
By the way, what brought you there?

55
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:31,653
I met the woman that appeared in my dream.

56
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:34,653
So I followed her.

57
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:37,283
Your dream?

58
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,052
That's right. She seemed to be in her thirties.

59
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,792
She wasn't wearing any makeup,

60
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,093
and her hair was tied back.

61
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:49,233
Does she have a mole under one eye?

62
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:51,972
Yes, she does. Do you know her?

63
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,932
I think I saw her while looking for Pil Joong.

64
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:55,272
Where does she live?

65
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,872
That I don't know.

66
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:00,872
I brushed past her, but she seemed oddly familiar...

67
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,512
even though I didn't know her.

68
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:05,783
How do you know her though?

69
00:06:06,353 --> 00:06:08,853
Actually, I don't know her either.

70
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:12,052
But for some reason, I keep seeing her in my dreams.

71
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:16,062
That's odd.

72
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:18,631
It's been bugging me too...

73
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,033
which is why I'm going to look for answers.

Are you not done yet?

What's taking you so long to grab a t-shirt?

But... Why do you need this?

Must you even ask?

80
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,431
It's to clear your name of course.

what if it only terrorizes Ha Yoon even more?

85

Don't worry about that. Hye Ju promised to tread lightly.

86

Kids were having fun in the playground...

She also gave them something.

Is that me and Ha Yoon?

90
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,012
I was crying at the time.

91
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:14,942
Why were you crying?

92
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,583
Because my mom and dad...

93
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:22,783
didn't want to live together anymore.

94
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:31,893
You were crying because you were upset.

00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:36,062
What did this lady give you?

96
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,273
Banana milk.

97
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:46,143
This lady offered banana milk to the children.

98
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:53,182
Ha Yoon, I'm here for you.

99
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:58,552
They shouldn't drink that.

100
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,752
She's a bad lady.

101
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,062
Was this bad lady...

102
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,463
wearing this shirt?

103

What on earth did she do...

107
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,252
wearing the foundation's T-shirt?

108
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:32,722
I'm more worried about all the bad she might have done.

109

Let's find her quickly.

Can we find her just with a tee?

111

We must find her somehow.

112

How?

00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,162
Not me, Wook.

He's really sly when it comes to this.

Not me, Wook.

116

It's even more suspicious that he hasn't moved in days.

They're funded by donations and volunteers.

128

They're pretty transparent about sharing financial information too.

129

They have a decent name.

Okay.

167
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,142
Let's stop discussing work and eat.

168
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,112
Sure.

169
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:00,162
How long will you be here for?

170
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:04,632
I haven't been here for a while so I'll do some sightseeing.

171
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:06,802
And get my item back.

172
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,073
I stashed it well.

173
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,041
- In your name... - No, not that.

174
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:14,213
The bigger thing. The thing that disappeared three years ago.

175
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:20,012
Oh Il Yong, was it?

176
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,083
There's still no news of him?

177
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:23,983
I'm still looking as well.

178
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:27,522
Why'd he swallow something he couldn't handle?

179
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:30,762
You.

180
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,803
You really don't know about it, right?

181
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:39,233
I'd have been found out if I did.

182
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,272
It was worth a fortune.

183
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,343
Right.

184
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:48,343
Let's move the item first and then plan a new gig.

185
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,213
Let's not mess up this time.

186
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,112
Don't worry.

187
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:58,053
- Do you eat eel? - What?

188
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:00,522
Yes.

189
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,193
Let's have eel next time.

190
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,762
I know a great place.

191
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:08,662
Thank you.

192
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,142
- Switch the plates. - Okay.

193
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:39,792
What's this?

194
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:44,402
Boss.

195
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:46,802
Will you hurry? He'll be waiting.

196
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,803
Look.

197
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:52,272
Darn it.

198
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:14,031
We knocked on every door...

199
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,362
but he's not in the area.

200
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,233
And he got away in a different car.

201
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,202
We need to find Kim Pil Joong...

202
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,703
if we're to find Detective Ko and Il Yong.

203
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,612
And find out if Lee Dong Min's really behind Jang Do Ri.

204
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,353
Since you mentioned Jang Do Ri.

205
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:35,882
Detective Shin.

206
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,053
Do you trust me?

207
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:43,122
Why? What is it?

208
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,492
I'm doing you a favor.

209
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:50,703
I'm watching the goons I saw last time.

210
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:54,803
Did you tag their car?

211
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,342
If they're watching us,

212
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:00,112
why can't I watch them?

213
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:02,843
Good for you.

214
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:05,983
I'd been feeling lost. Let's have a look.

215
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:15,762
Hang on. What's wrong?

216
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:17,892
What's going on?

217
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,162
- It went out! - Did they find it?

218
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,303
Where were they last? Let's check it out.

219
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:25,803
- I'll come too. - No.

220
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,842
Watching Jang Do Ri and Lee Dong Min can be dangerous.

221
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,102
I'll take over that part.

222
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,943
I'll call if I find something.

223
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:33,572
Send me the location, okay?

224
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:34,642
Thanks.

225
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,412
Did they really find it?

226
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:52,463
You know me, don't you?

227
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,262
I'm not sure. Who are you?

228
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:01,733
You look like someone I know.

229
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:03,973
I guess I was mistaken.

230
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,073
I apologize.

231
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,782
Can you get out of my way?

232
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,642
Sure, yes.

233
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,453
Sorry.

234
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:23,693
What a weird guy. Why did he try to talk to me?

235
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:05,502
(Guja-ro 10-gil)

236
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:02,483
Recently, we've had many young people come here.

237
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,423
Who are you? What is this place?

238
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:08,923
It's a village where people live.

239
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:12,492
You must have many questions. Come on in.

240
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:23,772
Come with me.

241
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,883
(Supermarket)

242
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,403
Here, have some scorched rice tea first.

243
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:40,112
Forget it. Let me use your phone.

244
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,842
I understand. I guess you have urgent matters to take care of.

245
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,782
You should have a snack before dinner.

246
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,852
It's hot. Blow on it to cool it down.

247
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,052
While you eat, I'll explain where you are now.

248
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,963
Anyway, what do you do?

249
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:02,133
You're very stylish.

250
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:11,802
Ouch, it's hot!

251
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:14,643
What are you doing?

252
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:18,312
It's you. You hurt Il Yong!

253
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,022
Il Yong?

254
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:23,953
You know Il Yong?

255
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,521
Who are you?

256
00:21:25,522 --> 00:21:27,052
Why do you need to know who I am?

257
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,163
Il Yong told me...

258
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,292
that he was stabbed by a friend of his whom he had trusted.

259
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:36,502
Pil Joong and I got this friendship ring together.

260
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,072
I thought we were friends.

261
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,903
I was an idiot.

262
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,512
You shouldn't call a jerk like him your friend.

263
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:49,943
It was you!

264
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:55,152
I always wanted to know what you looked like.

265
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:57,123
You're so ugly.

266
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,092
Woman, what are you saying?

267
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:01,922
Hey!

268
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:03,862
The mailbox was empty.

269
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,963
It didn't look like she lived with anyone.

270
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,362
I think she speaks Chinese.

271
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:10,633
Do you think she's here to work?

272
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,973
At least we know where she lives.

273
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,173
Let's look further into it.

274
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,203
Let go! You little...

275
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:20,072
What is going on?

276
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,383
Let go. Why you...

277
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:24,883
Hey! Who are you?

278
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:26,653
What?

279
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:29,552
Kim Pil Joong.

280
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:31,682
Captain, are you all right?

281
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,752
Why...

282
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,623
Il Yong? Is it you?

283
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,963
Yes, can't you see? You crazy jerk!

284
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,502
Goliath?

285
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,532
- He's dead too? - He just arrived.

286
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,271
Captain, how did you know he was Kim Pil Joong?

287
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:53,012
That ring. Il Yong had the exact same ring.

288
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:55,342
Darn you...

289
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,782
Hey, where is my body?

290
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:00,953
What is this nonsense about?

291
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:03,183
Where is the thing I asked you to hold onto?

292
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,922
You killed me. What did you do with my corpse?

293
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,592
You little... Have you lost your mind?

294
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,062
Have you gone insane?

295
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,432
You're right here. What corpse?

296
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,893
You still don't know what this place is?

297
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,663
What is this place?

298
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:19,703
It's where you come when you die.

299
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:22,402
It's your fault that I ended up here.

300
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:24,403
What are you talking about? I did not kill you.

301
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:27,072
You stabbed me!

302
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,541
I only stabbed you because you took the package...

303
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,252
and said you'd turn yourself in.

304
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,752
But that's not enough to kill someone.

305
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:44,622
Il Yong, Mr. Noh is looking for you with his eyes peeled.

306
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,892
We don't have time for this.

307
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,963
Let's find the package. Then the two of us...

308
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:50,762
What?

309
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:52,972
Hey.

310
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,932
- What is happening? - No.

311
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,742
Hey, where is my body?

312
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,473
Where is it? Tell me now!

313
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:00,742
Kim Pil Joong, tell us!

314
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:03,243
You can't leave like this! Hey!

315
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:08,612
No...

316
00:24:13,322 --> 00:24:14,393
He...

317
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:19,332
So he's gone?

318
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:23,733
But I...

319
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:26,772
What should I do?

320
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,542
Don't worry.

321
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,282
I'll find you, no matter what.

322
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:41,913
You need to stay strong.

323
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:59,332
- Thank you. - Take care.

324
00:24:59,973 --> 00:25:01,902
- Get home safely. - Thank you for your help.

325
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:03,972
- Good work today. - You should get going.

326
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,012
- I'll be off, then. - Thank you.

327
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:08,173
No problem. Get home safely.

328
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:10,082
Excuse me.

329
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:13,983
We're here to see Director Choi Ji Yeon.

00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:16,153
It's me.

331
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,051
Oh, hello.

332
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,193
Hello.

333
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:24,291
I'm immensely interested in child welfare.

334
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:26,592
I'd like to volunteer and help out using my skills and talents.

335
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:28,831
Oh, I'd also like to...

336
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,062
donate my used stuff.

337
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,172
I've been sending donations regularly,

338
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:35,703
but I'd like to do some volunteer work too.

339
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,072
Gosh, we'd be so grateful for your help.

340
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:42,842
Oh, right. I'm looking for someone who's been your longtime sponsor.

341
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:46,611
Someone I know is hugely indebted to that person...

342
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,312
and wants to thank her.

343
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:49,983
Who?

344
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,452
Was it about 15 years ago?

345
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:55,862
She volunteered here. A woman.

346
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:58,262
Hold on. What was her name?

347
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,831
Wouldn't there be records of these things?

348
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,632
Yes, probably.

349
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:05,703
We do have records of our recurring donors,

350
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,133
but if she just volunteered...

351
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,682
However, everyone has to submit an application.

352
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:18,612
Really? Then please help us so my friend can thank her.

353
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,312
- This is great. - Yes.

354
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:27,022
Nice.

355
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:31,162
My gosh. Thank you.

356
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:33,163
There's more.

Talk about finding a needle in a haystack.

358
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,002
This is where my skills come in handy.

359
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,002
Pardon me?

360
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:44,572
I'll organize everything here.

361
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,012
All of these?

362
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:50,482
We'll start with the files from 15 years ago as you mentioned.

363
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,542
Okay.

364
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:53,751
The truth is, I worked...

365
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,781
at a community service center up until two years ago.

366
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,952
From organizing, categorizing, and storing documents...

367
00:26:57,953 --> 00:27:00,393
to database management, this is my specialty.

368
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:03,192
Even so, there are way too many documents.

369
00:27:03,193 --> 00:27:06,233
Don't you worry. I'll start working on this tonight.

370
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:13,933
- Hi! - Hello.

371
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:15,572
Ms. Lee.

372
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,243
How will you go through all of them by yourself?

373
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,072
I said I'd organize them. I never said I'd do it by myself.

374
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:24,243
What?

375
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:30,052
Oh, I see. I'll be in the office.

376
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:34,022
I'm so quick-witted.

377
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,361
What are you doing after work?

378
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,463
Are you taking us out for dinner? I've got no plans.

379
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,493
All you think about is food.

380
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:42,963
Read the room, will you?

381
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,202
Why? Do you need us to work late?

382
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:48,572
Yes, but it's not for the cafe.

Hello, Shin Jun Ho speaking.

Hi, Detective Shin.

386
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:08,592
Goliath... I mean, Kim Pil Joong. He's dead.

387
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:10,993
What?

388
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,193
I'm a little confused too.

389
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:15,261
But he really is dead.

390
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:16,832
Did Kim Pil Joong come to that village?

391
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:18,402
Did he say where Detective Ko was?

392
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:19,802
He won't say where Detective Ko is,

393
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:22,542
let alone where Il Yong's body is.

394
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,301
He doesn't even know that he's dead.

395
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:28,342
He was adamant that he didn't kill Il Yong.

396
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,282
And then he just left all of a sudden.

397
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:34,082
Okay.

(Missing Persons Squad)

399
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:39,692
Hey, Detective Oh. Check all reports of unidentified male bodies...

400
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:41,153
and send me the files now.

401
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:43,122
He shouldn't have come at all.

402
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:46,832
If he did, he could've just told us about everything before leaving.

403
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,962
We chased after him for three years, but he just disappeared.

404
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,673
Il Yong is really disappointed.

405
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:56,802
So at a village where dead missing people live,

406
00:28:57,072 --> 00:29:00,143
the culprit who killed a missing person showed up.

407
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,112
How could this happen?

408
00:29:04,112 --> 00:29:06,653
But do people just come and go so quickly like that?

409
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:10,652
At Duon Village, I saw someone come and go in a day.

410
00:29:10,653 --> 00:29:12,723
But this is the first time I've seen someone disappear after an hour.

411
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,792
Captain Kang said the same too.

412
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,262
Is he teasing the dead or what?

413
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,462
He could've said something before he left, at least.

414
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:21,193
He did say something, though.

415
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:23,832
What?

416
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,203
He talked about some object.

417
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:31,643
I guess people are looking for something Il Yong hid.

418
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:34,072
I tried to ask him more, but he disappeared.

419
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:38,512
The guy who killed you is Kim Pil Joong?

420
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,723
Then Kim Pil Joong must be the guy behind my death too!

421
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:45,623
Darn it!

422
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:48,552
I should've smacked him in the face one last time.

423
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:53,633
Gosh, I'm too frustrated to stay at home today.

424
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:04,842
Goliath is dead?

Yes.

There's nobody to watch your back anymore.

427

You will take the blame for killing...

428
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,883
Jeon Dae Kyung, Choi Jung A, and Lee Kyung Sun.

429
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,152
- Why would I? - I told you before.

430
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,521
The syringe that was used to stab Choi Jung A...

431
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:23,623
had your DNA on it.

432
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:26,361
Don't lie to me.

433
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:28,233
Don't you remember the abandoned factory?

434
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:31,332
Choi Jung A was in the trunk of a car.

435
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,402
Ko Sang Chul wouldn't do it,

436
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:35,873
so you stabbed her yourself with the syringe.

437
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:40,413
And Ko Sang Chul...

438
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:44,281
His hands were tied behind his back and couldn't even resist.

439
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,152
And you stabbed him with a knife from the front.

440
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:47,582
Right there.

441
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,223
How dare you touch a police officer?

442
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:58,163
But nobody was there.

443
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:02,663
That's right. It was just you two in that container.

444
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:06,633
I know because the dead Ko Sang Chul told me.

445
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:09,002
Right?

446
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:17,183
So? Should I keep going?

447
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:20,252
I think Ko Sang Chul has a lot to say to you.

448
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:23,953
It wasn't me.

449
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:26,022
Goliath made me do everything.

450
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:28,453
Hey, punk.

451
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:31,893
How will you prove that? Goliath is dead now.

452
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,532
You just have to rot in here for the rest of your life.

453
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,973
There won't be any reason for me to come back here.

00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:54,652
Detective! It wasn't me! Goliath made me!

457
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:55,713
Detective!

458
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:58,653
Why?

459
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,752
Do you have something to say?

460
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,592
Captain, I found out where Detective Ko is.

461
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,662
"This time, they're not alone."

462
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:10,861
"Now!"

463
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,801

464

"and ride the wind down."

465
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,743
"They went and had fun with the kids."

466
00:32:19,342 --> 00:32:21,812
"Some cherry blossoms had a concern."

467
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,683
"It was nice to hear happy stories,"

468
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:27,312
"but they wanted to make someone happy too."

469
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:31,051
What were you doing?

470
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:33,092
I was reading a story for Alice.

471
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:36,861
Gosh, Alice. You must be so happy to have someone read to you.

472
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:38,223
I'll read it for you too.

473
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,392
It's my favorite book.

474
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,292
Ha Yoon only reads this.

475
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,531
She's read it more than 100 times.

476
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:46,272
It's not 100 times.

477
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,443
Come on out and have some sausages. Let's go.

478
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:51,173

- Young Rim. - Yes.

480
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:53,972
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

481
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,341
- Be careful not to drop it. - It looks so good.

482
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,542
- I want some too. - They're so excited.

483
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:02,252
What do you call it when you stare at a fire like this?

484
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,122
Fire space-out.

485
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:06,193
It's when you sit and space out and just stare at the fire.

486
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:08,693
Isn't it called a campfire?

487
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:10,422
You can call it that too,

488
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,663
but these days, people use the term spacing out at the fire more.

489
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:17,133
By the way, I feel so refreshed to see the kids play.

490
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,562

they wanted to see their youngest and wanted to call you.

I'm home.

657
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:27,072
Jjonga, you're coming home now?

658
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:29,003
- Yes. - Goodness.

659
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,473
It took you a while, then.

660
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,313
We sorted out all the paperwork.

661
00:49:34,773 --> 00:49:37,083
It's a matter of time before we catch the culprit.

662
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:38,982
Good.

663
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:40,683
Do you want some coffee?

664
00:49:41,253 --> 00:49:42,482
Up next.

665
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:44,722
A man in his 80s...

666
00:49:44,723 --> 00:49:47,353
who lived alone in a subdivided flat was found dead.

667
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:49,551
Police and neighbors say...

668
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,691
he had a chronic illness...

669
00:49:51,692 --> 00:49:55,433
and couldn't move about easily due to pain in the knees.

670
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,433
It's said he lost touch with his family ten years ago.

671
00:50:00,232 --> 00:50:03,742
I didn't think you'd actually sort it all out.

672
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:05,941
That was nothing at all.

673
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:08,913
You'd lose your mind if you saw what Ms. Lee can really do.

674
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:13,212
Here's the schedule.

675
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:16,112
Call ahead on the days you're free.

676
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:22,192
I'll be in touch after I have a chat with Ms. Lee.

677
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:23,422
Okay.

678
00:50:24,362 --> 00:50:25,422
Goodness.

679
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:28,492
- Mr. Jang. - Yes?

680
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:29,762
Would you like one?

681
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:35,632
Oh, gosh, no. I'm fine.

682
00:50:35,873 --> 00:50:39,773
I get into some bad trouble if I drink milk.

683
00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:45,682
Do you usually buy lots of cartons of banana milk?

684
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:46,712
No.

685
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,422
A benefactor sometimes brings a few for the staff.

686
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:51,683
I see.

687
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:57,362
Since when has that person been doing such good deeds?

688
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:01,032
I think we first met 15 or 16 years ago.

689
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:02,962
Okay.

690
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,953
You're scaring me, Il Yong.

691
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,782
The dust was bothering me.

692
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:29,422
I'll wipe every surface,

693
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:32,223
mop the floor and reorganize the place.

694
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:34,362
You take the day off.

695
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:36,063
Hey, you...

696
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:42,302
Okay.

697
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:11,461
Finish the dishes, please.

698
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,603
Gosh, it stinks.

699
00:52:20,672 --> 00:52:22,473
Shall I warm you some food?

700
00:52:24,012 --> 00:52:26,212
My mouth is so dry.

701
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:30,552
You need to eat to stay alert and well.

702
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:33,753
If you find it hard to chew,

703
00:52:36,922 --> 00:52:38,663
would you like this instead?

704
00:52:42,632 --> 00:52:43,663
Yes.

705
00:52:58,712 --> 00:52:59,881
Fifteen years ago,

706
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:02,112
Ha Yoon and Young Rim disappeared from this playground.

707
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:06,052
Two blocks away is a senior citizen welfare center.

708
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:09,122
The day the kids disappeared, Blue Bird Hope Foundation...

709
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:10,993
sent a team here to bathe and cut their hair.

710
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:14,692
How are we to find a woman who helped out 15 years ago?

711
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,132
How many volunteers helped that day?

712
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:20,532
- Thirty. - Thirty people?

713
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:23,171
The kids said the person...

714
00:53:23,172 --> 00:53:25,942
who gave them the milk was an older lady.

715
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:29,242
Out of the 30 volunteers, there were 8 who were...

716
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:30,813
in their 30s or older.

717
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:34,152
These are the files on those eight people.

718
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:42,092
Do you think the T-shirt could be a clue?

719
00:53:44,493 --> 00:53:46,361
I had a look,

720
00:53:46,362 --> 00:53:48,493
but they all wore the same shirt.

721
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,703
But one of them ran a milk delivery service then.

722
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:55,603
Hey.

723
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:59,043
Earlier, when I was at the foundation's office,

724
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:02,242
someone had dropped off a bag full of banana milk.

725
00:54:02,243 --> 00:54:03,841
She does that once or twice a week...

726
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:05,611
and she has been volunteering for a long time.

727
00:54:05,612 --> 00:54:09,381
It's been 15 years. Someone else must own the delivery service now.

728
00:54:09,382 --> 00:54:12,821
No, that person doesn't run a milk delivery service.

729
00:54:12,822 --> 00:54:14,623
She's a caregiver.

730
00:54:14,953 --> 00:54:17,052
- A caregiver? - Yes.

731
00:54:17,793 --> 00:54:19,761
Why would a caregiver give out milk?

732
00:54:19,762 --> 00:54:20,762
How would I know?

733
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:23,762
Does she run a milk delivery service?

734
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:25,503
That's crazy.

735
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,961
Mr. Jang.

736
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:28,531
Call the office and ask...

737
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:32,071
if the caregiver's name is Kim Gun Ju.

738
00:54:32,072 --> 00:54:34,773
She was there at the time.

739
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:36,542
Is she a caregiver?

740
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,841
Why would you call to ask about her?

741
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,412
She was there helping out when the kids disappeared.

742
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:44,352
Who knows? She was the only caregiver then.

743
00:54:44,353 --> 00:54:47,082
You don't want to suspect her just because of what she does...

744
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,222
and cause a bigger problem for...

745
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:50,352
Director?

746
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,722
Yes, it's Pan Seok.

747
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:54,833
When I was at the office earlier,

748
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:57,932
the person who dropped off the banana milk.

749
00:54:57,933 --> 00:54:59,862
Is her name Kim Gun Ju?

750
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:04,543
No, I'm thinking she could be the person I'm looking for.

751
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:06,702
Yes, that's her.

752
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,413
Okay, thank you.

753
00:55:08,712 --> 00:55:09,712
It's her.

754
00:55:10,243 --> 00:55:11,611
I told you so.

755
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:13,112
I said something was up.

756
00:55:13,382 --> 00:55:15,552
The caregiver, it's her.

757
00:55:15,882 --> 00:55:17,782
- Is this her? - For real?

758
00:55:43,313 --> 00:55:45,212
Why are you out here crying on your own?

759
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,753
Did you fight with your friends?

760
00:55:50,822 --> 00:55:54,552
My friends said they don't want to play with me.

761
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:55,953
Oh, dear.

762
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,063
Where do you live?

763
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,833
Do you live here?

764
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:04,933
Where's your mom?

765
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:08,433
She went to be with angels.

766
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:15,543
My mom's with the angels too.

767
00:56:16,913 --> 00:56:18,712
She was very sick.

768
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:24,623
Kim Gun Ju wasn't a caregiver 15 years ago.

769
00:56:26,223 --> 00:56:29,293
I used to want to be a teacher.

770
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:32,993
I became a nurse's aide after graduating from high school.

771
00:56:33,962 --> 00:56:35,532
To look after my mom.

772
00:56:36,532 --> 00:56:39,362
I thought she'd get better if I looked after her.

773
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:42,103
She got sicker every day.

774
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:44,603
Then one day...

775
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:48,342
she held my hand tight and said this.

776
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:51,882
"Please..."

777
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,152
"kill me."

778
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,922
She was a nurse's aide until she quit ten years ago.

779
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:01,821
Three years later, she became a licensed caregiver...

780
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:03,522
and has been doing that since.

781
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:05,921
Out of all the elderly she visited,

782
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,993
thirteen of them died alone at home.

783
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:09,663
Thirteen?

784
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:13,961
Yes. They were all old and had chronic illnesses,

785
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,802
so their deaths were ruled natural.

786
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:19,873
None of them died when Kim Gun Ju looked after them.

787
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:22,112
They all died a few years after.

788
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:28,282
But I think this is too meticulous to call it a coincidence.

789
00:57:29,953 --> 00:57:31,953
If your supposition is right,

790
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,552
why Ha Yoon and Young Rim?

791
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:36,321
They weren't old.

792
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:37,393
Right.

793
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:41,092
Kim Gun Ju didn't know any of them beforehand.

794
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:44,932
When she was a nurse's aide for a pediatrician,

795
00:57:44,933 --> 00:57:46,603
some of the patients went missing.

796
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:50,172
They were all kids on welfare...

797
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:52,143
or from orphanages.

798
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,043
Why would she kill those poor people?

799
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,482
Do you think...

800
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:02,953
she killed them out of pity?

801
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,615
Dying in peace now...

802
00:58:31,014 --> 00:58:33,414
is better than living a painful life.

803
00:58:36,525 --> 00:58:37,755
My mother too...

804
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:42,795
I wish I could've let her go sooner.

805
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:04,414
Gosh, that's nuts. She kills them because she pities them?

806
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:05,783
Who does she think she is?

807
00:59:05,784 --> 00:59:08,724
She's a crazy psychopath. She's sick in the head.

808
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:11,425
She is a crazy serial killer.

809
00:59:11,594 --> 00:59:13,924
As for the seniors, the cases were closed as solitary deaths.

810
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,894
But the children are still missing.

811
00:59:16,295 --> 00:59:18,065
If Kim Gun Ju really is the culprit...

812
00:59:19,835 --> 00:59:21,835
We must hurry up and figure out where she buried the bodies.

813
00:59:23,804 --> 00:59:24,874
Where are you going?

814
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:26,804
To find the kids.

815
00:59:28,074 --> 00:59:29,144
Come on. Get up.

816
00:59:30,244 --> 00:59:32,315
Let's get going! Hurry.

817
00:59:56,065 --> 00:59:58,704
- I'm not done yet. - I cleaned the floor yesterday.

818
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:01,545
No one uses this room anyway. We don't have to clean it every day.

819
01:00:02,704 --> 01:00:05,013
Then I'll wash the dishes...

820
01:00:05,014 --> 01:00:06,115
No, sit down.

821
01:00:10,784 --> 01:00:12,215
He vanished like that,

822
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,755
so I know that you're really upset.

823
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,195
Detective Ko is gone too.

824
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:24,795
It's all I thought about...

825
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:28,034
for the past three years.

826
01:00:30,405 --> 01:00:32,275
I don't know what to do now.

827
01:00:32,335 --> 01:00:35,344
What do you mean? Just keep at it.

828
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:37,944
You didn't chase that punk because you liked him.

829
01:00:37,945 --> 01:00:39,643
You only did it...

830
01:00:39,644 --> 01:00:41,385
to figure out where he hid your body.

831
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,215
Only Pil Joong knew where he hid it, but he's now dead.

832
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:48,085
You see, I wasn't going to say this, but...

833
01:00:49,954 --> 01:00:51,295
Honestly, this serves him right.

834
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:54,123
I'd rather have him dead...

835
01:00:54,124 --> 01:00:55,525
than see him live a good life.

836
01:00:56,295 --> 01:01:00,195
And I got to throw that hot tea on him.

837
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,474
If he didn't die, he'd keep doing bad things.

838
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:09,675
We can find you even with him gone.

839
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:12,944
You can still leave the village,

840
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:15,085
and Wook will do everything in his power to help you.

841
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:19,255
Both Mr. Jang and Wook will help you.

842
01:01:19,914 --> 01:01:22,155
They'll never let anyone in the village suffer unjustly.

843
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:23,755
I know that for a fact.

844
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:28,925
I know that too.

845
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:31,494
Even when Detective Ko left,

846
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:35,565
I got to say everything I wanted because Wook gave me a heads-up.

847
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:40,405
All right, then.

848
01:01:43,675 --> 01:01:44,744
Let's go outside.

849
01:01:57,224 --> 01:02:01,155
(Hyun Ji! Dad will find your friends too.)

850
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:20,144
My gosh, thank you.

851
01:02:21,715 --> 01:02:22,944
It's schisandra berry tea.

852
01:02:22,945 --> 01:02:24,654
I picked the berries and dried them myself.

853
01:02:24,655 --> 01:02:27,014
Oh, my. How precious.

854
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:35,025
My gosh, this is nice.

855
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:38,494
So you have some questions for me?

856
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:40,394
Yes.

857
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:43,764
Well...

858
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:46,635
Gosh, I'm sorry.

859
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:50,974
You must remember...

860
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,775
Ha Yoon and Young Rim.

861
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:56,485
Who?

862
01:02:57,485 --> 01:03:01,115
A while ago, the playground...

863
01:03:04,485 --> 01:03:05,525
In the playground,

864
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:09,324
you gave them banana milk...

865
01:03:21,605 --> 01:03:25,074
Banana milk in the playground?

866
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:27,744
I feel bad for Mr. Jang.

867
01:03:28,315 --> 01:03:30,885
Fifteen years after his young daughter went missing,

868
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:32,414
her skeleton was found.

869
01:03:33,315 --> 01:03:36,224
And a little while after his daughter went missing,

870
01:03:36,784 --> 01:03:38,624
his wife took her own life.

871
01:03:40,124 --> 01:03:43,195
He has made a few suicide attempts too.

872
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:51,405
I remember those kids I met in the playground.

873
01:03:52,905 --> 01:03:55,204
They're in a good place now.

874
01:03:56,405 --> 01:03:57,775
Mr. Jang.

875
01:03:59,244 --> 01:04:01,844
Let go of all your painful memories.

876
01:04:04,184 --> 01:04:05,585
Rest in peace.

877
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:34,045
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

878
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:36,884
They say you should take secrets to the grave.

879
01:04:36,885 --> 01:04:39,554
But none of us even has a grave yet.

880
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:41,824
When will you take us?

881
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:44,324
Pan Seok!

882
01:04:44,824 --> 01:04:46,324
Where are these kids?

883
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,763
Why are you asking me?

884
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:50,795
Find Young Rim and Ha Yoon no matter what.

885
01:04:50,894 --> 01:04:52,465
They've been here for too long.

886
01:04:52,494 --> 01:04:53,593
How could I forget?

887
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:56,364
It's all thanks to Detective Shin and Kim Wook.

888
01:04:56,365 --> 01:04:59,074
We shouldn't rule out anything. We shouldn't underestimate them.

889
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:00,634
Who are you, mister?

890
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,304
Let's just say I'm your dad's friend.
