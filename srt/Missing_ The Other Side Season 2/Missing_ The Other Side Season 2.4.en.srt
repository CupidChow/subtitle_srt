1
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,215
Dad.

2
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,885
Who? Me?

3
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:14,724
Yes.

4
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,194
But I haven't been married.

5
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,324
How can I be your dad?

6
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:21,065
Of course you'd say that.

7
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,894
You should know that I'm just as baffled by all this.

8
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:27,134
Why would you be?

9
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:30,035
This is obviously baffling you, and that flusters me.

10
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,605
What are you getting at?

11
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,344
Did someone put you up to this?

12
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,973
Where do you live? Who are your parents?

13
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:38,684
I can't answer all those questions at once.

14
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,183
Right. You're Moon Bo Ra. How old are you?

15
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:43,214
I'm 14.

16
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,954
- Who are your parents? - My mom is Moon Se Young.

17
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,794
- Who? - Moon Se Young.

18
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:51,924
And here's my dad.

19
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,964
(Wook and Se Young)

20
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:59,034
The one next to her must be my dad.

21
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:03,674
You don't have the same hairstyle,

22
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:05,904
but you're still just as handsome.

23
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:08,674
(Wook and Se Young, 100th day as a couple)

24
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,115
You and Se Young...

25
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,055
don't look alike.

26
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,555
Of course. I take after my dad.

27
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:24,423
Upper eyelid crease,

28
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:26,594
big eyes, and sharp nose. I'm the spitting image of you.

29
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:30,635
Are you really...

30
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,335
Se Young's daughter?

31
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,305
Yes, I am.

32
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:47,314
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

33
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:51,414
What is this nonsense I'm hearing?

34
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:53,154
This isn't a telenovela.

35
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:54,955
How did a daughter appear out of nowhere?

36
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,153
There's no need to get worked up over it.

37
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:59,193
Just take a seat for now.

38
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,194
How can I not take this seriously...

39
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:03,365
when Wook has a daughter I wasn't aware of?

40
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:04,735
Are you the daughter?

41
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:07,204
Wook, take a seat too.

42
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:09,934
You pacing is only making my head spin.

43
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:11,634
How could I sit still right now?

44
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:14,344
You're Wook's daughter?

45
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:17,175
No, this has to be a nightmare.

46
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:18,943
A daughter appearing out of thin air?

47
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,183
I see the resemblance and a lot of it.

48
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,254
- I'm not her dad! - What the...

49
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:26,853
Don't shout! You'll alarm the kid.

50
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:27,955
I'm not a kid.

51
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,124
See what I mean?

52
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:34,124
She has to have the last word and talks back.

53
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,965
That's you, Wook.

54
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,395
Does Se Young know that...

55
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:40,533
Does your mom know you're here?

56
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:41,974
Of course she doesn't.

57
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:45,034
I wouldn't be here if I were in touch with her.

58
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,873
What is she saying?

59
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,014
She hasn't been able to reach her mom for a few days,

60
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,174
so she came here to find her dad.

61
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:52,843
I said, I'm not her dad. Can you stop saying that?

62
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:54,884
Yes, he says he's not her dad.

63
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,215
Have you contacted the police?

64
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,925
Yes, I have.

65
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:02,055
But our landlady said...

66
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,865
She said my mom abandoned me and ran off with another man.

67
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,495
What?

68
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:09,265
What?

69
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:13,235
It's fine. It doesn't even hurt me anymore.

70
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:21,075
What's with this awkward silence?

71
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,414
So? Why are you here?

72
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:28,955
Well...

73
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:33,184
Can I stay here for the time being?

74
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:35,455
What?

75
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,224
No, you can't!

76
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,924
Why not?

77
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,633
There will be 4 housemates instead of 3. No big deal.

78
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:43,664
Pan Seok.

79
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,064
Bo Ra.

80
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:50,034
It's only been three hours since we met...

81
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,903
Oh, I'm on a diet right now.

82
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:57,515
Come on! You shouldn't be on a diet. You're growing.

83
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:00,214
Yes, let's all eat something.

84
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,085
I'm starving.

85
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:05,053
Ms. Lee, spare me a minute.

86
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,054
Come with me.

87
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:11,224
Come here! I asked you to spare me a minute.

88
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:41,454
You can use this room today.

89
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:44,224
I'll sleep in Pan Seok's room today.

90
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,765
Is this your room, Dad?

91
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,764
We need to set things straight.

92
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,334
I am that guy in the photo,

93
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,435
but it can't serve as proof that I am your father.

94
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,974
You understand what I'm saying, right?

95
00:05:58,705 --> 00:05:59,743
Yes.

96
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:01,775
You admitted that you were the man in the photo.

97
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:07,515
Well, it is true that I am the man in the photo.

98
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:10,354
But I'm not your dad.

99
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,385
Okay, got it.

100
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,184
You're the man in the photo,

101
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:16,895
but it doesn't prove that you're my dad.

102
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,694
Then by the same token, it doesn't prove that you aren't my dad either.

103
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:20,723
Right?

104
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:22,993
Gosh. She has to talk back every single time, doesn't she?

105
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,334
Who do you take after?

106
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,033
You, Dad. I told you.

107
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,733
Your friend said the same thing earlier.

108
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,834
I really can't get used to hearing someone call me "Dad."

109
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,574
It's just as awkward for me too.

110
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,844
I'm saying the word for the 1st time in 14 years, so it's super awkward.

111
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,385
Let me stay here just until Mom comes back.

112
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:43,385
Well, this isn't the first time she just packed up and left.

113
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:45,114
She will come back.

114
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,284
Does Se Young disappear like this often?

115
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:51,124
There were many times when she didn't come home for a day or two.

116
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,695
Sometimes, even longer.

117
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:56,294
But she always called me.

118
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,604
I won't wait for her anymore.

119
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:04,234
I can't stand the neighbors' pitiful gazes...

120
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,505
and hate having to walk on eggshells around our landlady.

121
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,044
Your landlady? Why?

122
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,444
Just because. Because of some things she does.

123
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:15,755
Some things? Like what? Tell me.

124
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:18,684
She says in front of the neighbors...

125
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,755
that we've been behind on rent for months.

126
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,854
I can't live there anymore because I'm embarrassed.

127
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,065
Goodness.

128
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,625
It sounds like you have a lot on your plate.

129
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:32,135
Anyway, unpack and get some rest.

130
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,625
It's not like I was thrilled to come here.

131
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:56,724
Why did I come here?

132
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:58,625
Because you're my dad.

133
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,394
(Wook and Se Young, 100th day as a couple)

134
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,395
Mom.

135
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:06,604
Dad says...

136
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,335
that he's not my dad.

137
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,544
(Wook and Se Young, 100th day as a couple)

138
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,984
I still have Se Young's number.

139
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,294
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

140
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:43,635
Are you asleep?

141
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:47,544
How could I be?

142
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:53,815
Are you sure she's not your daughter?

143
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:57,085
They say you can never hide it when someone is of your blood.

144
00:08:57,614 --> 00:09:00,354
Come on. I've never even been married.

145
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:04,054
You don't have to get married to have a child.

146
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,994
I'm just saying, it's what people say.

147
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,594
I'm not the one who said it.

148
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,264
In any case, that kid did nothing wrong.

149
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,504
What do you mean?

150
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:21,103
If you're not actually her dad like you're insisting,

151
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:24,445
you may feel wronged.

152
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,744
But Bo Ra did nothing wrong.

153
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:31,853
It's not like she begged to be born into this world.

154
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:36,124
And it's not her fault that she had to grow up without a dad.

155
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:40,224
I know that.

156
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,134
You know? Then I'll stop.

157
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:44,894
Anyway, is Bo Ra's mother okay?

158
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,905
Bo Ra said her mother usually comes home after a few days.

159
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,974
But I should try contacting her.

160
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,175
Yes, you should.

161
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:55,944
Make sure she's okay so that Bo Ra can put her worries to rest.

162
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:57,315
Try to track her down.

163
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:01,045
You and that kid look so much alike.

164
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:03,514
Are you sure she's not your kid?

165
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,585
- Stop, seriously! - Goodness.

166
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:08,555
Don't yell. I'm not deaf.

167
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,795
You know something?

168
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,565
It's really fun to tease you.

169
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:19,835
You're having fun teasing me in this situation?

170
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:25,134
I suppose you did everything even at such a young age.

171
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,604
Oh, dear.

172
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,185
Are you really Wook's daughter?

173
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, I think so.

174
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,224
You think so?

175
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,764
So you're not sure?

176
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:49,893
Are you my dad's girlfriend?

177
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:50,894
What?

178
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:52,705
Do we look like we're dating?

179
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,364
No.

180
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:56,474
Oh, okay.

181
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,905
Just drop me off here.

182
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,675
Okay, sure.

183
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:09,084
- What time will you be done? - I can go alone.

184
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,785
Thank you for the ride.

185
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:12,655
Sure.

186
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,454
Goodness.

187
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,623
She's nothing like Wook.

188
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,494
Wook is never that assertive.

189
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,994
That brat is really something.

190
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:27,004
- Mister! - Yes!

191
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:31,805
My gosh, Ha Yoon!

192
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,805
Oh, no.

193
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:37,244
Gosh. Are you all right, Ha Yoon?

194
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:40,785
Why did you run? You could've walked.

195
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,114
I'm fine.

196
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,514
But it hurts.

197
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:45,825
What?

198
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,493
You said you had something for me. What is it?

199
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:57,165
Oh, right. Here.

200
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,104
What's this key for?

201
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,364
The treasure chest.

202
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:05,405
Hyun Ji kept the treasure chest, and I kept the key.

203
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,374
What's in it?

204
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,244
Our treasures.

205
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:13,013
We put our letters and the pictures we took together...

206
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:14,744
in the treasure chest.

207
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,984
But it's gone now.

208
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,354
The treasure chest is gone because Hyun Ji left?

209
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:25,764
So you only have the key now?

210
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,835
That's why I want to give you this.

211
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:33,405
If you give something as a gift, it never disappears...

212
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,305
even after I'm gone.

213
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:45,884
All right.

214
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,315
I will...

215
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,754
treasure this.

216
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:58,894
Thank you.

(65 Myeongjin 7-gil)

218

Here is Bo Ra and her mother's overdue rent.

219
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,393
But why are you giving me this?

220
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:35,964
Please accept it.

221
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,634
Okay. I will, but...

222
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,305
Who is it?

223
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:46,144
Hello. The gate was open.

224
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:49,744
I'm Moon Se Young's friend.

225
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:53,344
Hey!

226
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,354
You're Moon Se Young's friend?

227
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,655
She really does have many dates.

228
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:01,384
Bo Ra's mom's out, and so is Bo Ra.

229
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:03,524
I know that.

230
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:07,024
How much rent do they owe you?

231
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,465
This detective just paid it all off.

232
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:14,465
Should I accept it?

233
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,434
- Then... - Yes, of course.

234
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,304
You should accept it.

235
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:21,604
It's safe to accept money from a cop.

236
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,014
Yes.

237
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:32,254
If you hear any strange rumors,

238
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:34,524
please tell me.

239
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,353
Strange rumors?

240
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:37,455
You know,

241
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:40,294
rumors like she ran away leaving her kid behind.

242
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,024
That sort of stuff.

243
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:45,633
People need to be sued for defamation...

244
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,863
after spreading groundless rumors to know just how tiring,

245
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:52,804
annoying, and tedious life can get.

246
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,445
Stuff will keep happening.

247
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,814
You know what Bo Ra's like, don't you?

248
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,574
She's 14, that's a nightmare age,

249
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:00,414
and if she were to hear the rumors?

250
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,784
"Lady, did you see my mom do that?"

251
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:04,685
"Did you see her run away?"

252
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,085
Just thinking about it gives me the chills.

253
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:08,954
Right, Detective Shin?

254
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,594
That happens a lot, doesn't it?

255
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,024
Well, yes, it does happen, sometimes.

256
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:18,034
It happens a lot these days.

257
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:21,434
I've never heard of any rumors like that.

258
00:15:21,435 --> 00:15:23,334
Of course you wouldn't have.

259
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,474
You look amazingly classy.

260
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,874
You'd scold people if you heard them gossip.

261
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,585
Yes, I am like that.

262
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,754
Here.

263
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:39,585
Thanks.

264
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,353
This is expensive.

265
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:43,393
It's not cheap.

266
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,753
Rich grandsons get to do this.

267
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:47,024
Treating others.

268
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:49,695
My grandmother's rich, not me.

269
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,634
I paid for that with my salary.

270
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:53,734
Do cops make good money?

271
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,535
You paid her rent like it was nothing.

272
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:57,774
It wasn't nothing.

273
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,974
I'd been saving up for months to buy a new PC and...

Never mind.

276
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:09,354
Why were you going to pay her rent?

277
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,784
Are you really Moon Se Young's friend?

278
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:12,854
How do you know Bo Ra?

279
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:14,984
I was...

280
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:19,223
going to pay off the rent so Bo Ra wouldn't feel so bad.

281
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:22,264
But you already paid it off so I get to keep my money.

282
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:25,594
Se Young is a friend of mine.

283
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:27,004
Bo Ra...

284
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,644
I don't know. She suddenly showed up calling me "Dad."

285
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,243
Hey. That's disgusting.

286
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,315
My gosh.

287
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,014
"Dad?"

288
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:46,523
Is Bo Ra your daughter?

289
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:48,624
As if I'd be her dad.

290
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:49,825
I'm still unwed.

291
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,724
How do you know Moon Se Young?

292
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:54,494
You're not just a friend.

293
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,335
We are friends.

294
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,165
I haven't seen her in 15 years.

295
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,435
Bo Ra will stay with me for a while.

296
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:05,134
She's no pushover. I wonder where she got it from.

297
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,773
- Is she really your... - No, she's not.

298
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:11,045
It's not what you think, okay?

299
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:12,614
I'm off.

You won't give her a hard time, will you?

301
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:24,925
Get in.

302
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,023
It's fine. I'll walk.

303
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:30,835
I'm on the way home. Get in. I'll give you a ride.

304
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:44,814
I could take the bus.

305
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,645
I was just passing by.

306
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,855
How long will you stay with us for?

307
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,324
Did Dad tell you to ask me?

308
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:58,455
Does he feel uncomfortable having me around?

309
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,323
No, Wook's not like that.

310
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:03,034
I'm asking for myself.

311
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:08,304
It's just until Mom comes home.

312
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:12,375
Is there a place you'd go to with your mom?

313
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,004
Somewhere she could be.

314
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,044
No.

315
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,185
I'll move out if I find a job even before Mom comes back.

316
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,053
You got it all wrong.

317
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,524
I just asked as an investigative...

318
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:31,155
A middle-school kid can't work.

319
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:32,925
I won't kick you out.

320
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:35,224
Don't get weird ideas, and just study.

321
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,135

322
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,064
Don't thank me.

323
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,474
Do you like my dad?

324
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:47,774
What?

325
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,244
Hey. He doesn't have a decent job, and he barely pays the rent.

326
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:54,885
As if I'd like him.

327
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,584
Do you like anyone with a pretty face?

328
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,455
Don't get weird ideas, and just study.

329
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:04,195
She likes him.

330
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,205
This is where I come to study.

331
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:15,665
You can stay here for now.

332
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,605
Here's the key to the main door.

333
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:20,845
I'll text you the door code.

334
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:24,675
Gosh, I love it here.

335
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,514
I'll let you rest, then.

336
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:32,554
Study or do your homework.

337
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:44,234
Keep friends close and enemies even closer.

338
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:48,205
As of now, this is the best option.

339
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,043
You won't go home?

340
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:55,974
That's right. Look at this.

341
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,044
This is the key to Hyun Ji's treasure chest.

342
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,284
Ha Yoon gave it to me.

343
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:03,513
You can look at it whenever you come here.

344
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:06,984
I can't go anywhere and leave what Hyun Ji touched behind.

345
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:10,695
Yes, you're right. This belonged to Hyun Ji.

346
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,655
You sent her off.

347
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,125
She's no longer here.

348
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,435
It's because she's no longer here.

349
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:21,864
I'm a pathetic dad who was always too late.

350
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:22,935
Even now,

351
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,204
I want to know where she sat,

352
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:27,404
what she touched, what she ate,

353
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,345
and what she talked about.

354
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,885
Okay? Wook?

355
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,084
Wook.

356
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,254

360

Mr. Jung gets sleepy early in the evening,

361
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,033
so he goes to bed early.

362
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,263
Hye Ju can't drink at all,

363
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,435
and Il Yong's no fun because there's a generational gap.

364
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:35,105
Mr. Jung the headmaster?

365
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:38,744
Yes. I heard he used to teach Korean Literature.

366
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:41,415
He spews such fancy words.

367
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,155
He wrote a few books too.

368
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:45,615
How did he end up here?

369
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:47,824
Let me see.

370
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:50,625
Him...

371
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:53,494
His name...

372
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:57,095
is Jung Young Jin or something.

373
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,635
Right?

374
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:04,135
Jung Young Jin.

375
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:05,534
Go on.

376
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,175
My gosh.

377
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,175
You're going to find everyone here?

378
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:13,385
Leave him out.

379
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:15,044
What?

380
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:17,885
He says he should never be found.

381
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:19,925
Why?

382
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:22,324
He was diagnosed with cancer ten years ago.

383
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:23,924
The doctor said he was terminal,

384
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,054
so he jumped to his death where no one would find him.

385
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:28,993
His wife died when they were young,

386
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,135
and he remarried later in life.

387
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,164
His grown children disapproved,

388
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,405
and he couldn't register her as his legal wife.

389
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,405
I guess they were afraid they'd get a smaller inheritance.

390
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:41,273
All his kids moved abroad...

391
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:43,513
and called him maybe once a year, at most.

392
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,344
That's even more reason to live.

393
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,814
Why did he jump to his death?

394
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:49,385
There's a sad story behind that.

395
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:54,254
He and his second wife lived off his pension.

396
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,154
If he were to die,

397
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,695
she'd lose everything, home and all.

398
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:02,524
She had no family to return to, and she was frail too.

399
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:07,435
Since he was terminally ill,

400
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:11,905
he decided to take his own life so she could live off his pension.

401
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:14,375
Oh, dear.

402
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:18,473
- There are all sorts of stories. - It's such a pity.

403
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,814
Everyone here had it rough.

404
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:27,724
Give me that.

405
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:29,283
It's mine. Why?

406
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,925
I won't take it from you. Let's see it.

407
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:34,695
Why are you staring at it like that?

408
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,733
Where'd you get this?

409
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:38,034
Ha Yoon gave it to me earlier.

410
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,304
Ha Yoon?

411
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,175
It's that.

412
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:45,034
What?

413
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:46,844

That's mine!

00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,445

417
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,133

What is this place?

421
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:08,244
The Room of Memories.

422
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:10,182
What? The Room of Memories?

423
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,814
That's what I call it.

424
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:24,893
This photo is my prized possession.

425
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,463
It's kind of embarrassing to hand over,

426
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,004
but here's the book I wrote.

427
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:32,702

It's what I cherish the most.

430
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:40,113
I'll keep it safe, then.

431

For a while, I had forgotten about it.

Why didn't I think to ask Ha Yoon?

448

They were best friends.

449

I thought these had been lost.

This surprised me more than it surprised you.

She only needed to see it once in a while.

But then you came by with the key that opens it.

Your clever daughter had me keep the box safe for her...

00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:43,854
A life away from home is unstable.

494
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,422
Our home barely gets sunlight,

495
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,854
but I find it most comfortable there.

496
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:50,064
Right, I'm glad you think that way.

497
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:52,494
Why would you leave your cozy home?

498
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:56,703
Are you bashing me for leaving my place to come here?

499
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:00,933
What? Of course not.

500
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,373
But leaving this place as well would be considered as running away.

501
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:08,514
What?

502
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:13,314
Are you sure you're not my dad?

503
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:25,663
Let's say that I am.

504
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:28,293
Until your mom comes back,

505
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:30,933
call me whatever you want.

506
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,173
It's late. You should go to bed.

507
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:41,143
Dad.

508
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,024
What?

509
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:57,663
Nothing. I just wanted to call you.

510
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:02,794
Don't you dare run away.

511
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,113
"Let's say that I am."

512
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,943
"Call me whatever you want."

513
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:51,113
Who was that?

514
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,653
Are you heading out?

515
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:35,093
I slept in because of you, and now I'm late.

516
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,294
I'll get going, then.

517
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:38,363
Have a good day.

518
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:41,193
Gosh.

519
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:45,333
Where are you off to this early in the morning?

520
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:47,203
To see a real estate agent.

521
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,273
A real estate agent? What for?

522
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,004
I have my reasons. I'm off, then.

523
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:52,544
Sure.

524
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:57,713
Why is everyone an early bird today?

525
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:04,983
Headmaster Jung, hello.

526
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:07,393
- Gosh, Mr. Jang. - Hi.

527
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:10,024
Were you out farming?

528
00:32:10,423 --> 00:32:11,764
Oh, these.

529
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:15,633
I was going to weed the school flower garden.

530
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,504
I don't want the kids getting skin irritation.

531
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,402
Besides, we'll soon be having a field day.

532
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:21,932
That's nice to hear. Let me help.

533
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,142
- Let me. - No, that's not necessary.

534
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,803
I can do this much myself.

535
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,142
You're still getting settled in.

536
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:31,314
I felt guilty about not pulling my weight around here.

537
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:33,813
- Here, let me. - You're unbelievable.

538
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:34,853
Come on.

539
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,953
The school's that way, right?

540
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:38,383
I'll get right on it.

541
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:42,423
Hyun Ji...

542
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:45,693
would've given me an earful for making her dad do chores.

543
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:49,693
What was Hyun Ji like?

544
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:52,264
Just look at Ha Yoon. Doesn't that tell you enough?

545
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:55,132
As they say, "If you feel like you don't know a lot..."

546
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,744
"about your own children, look at their friends."

547
00:32:58,203 --> 00:32:59,344
Look at Ha Yoon.

548
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,472
She's cheerful and smart.

549
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:04,284
She looks like she could be selfish but always puts others first.

550
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,344
She's always busy taking care of others.

551
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:08,713
That's so true.

552
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,524
Ha Yoon is still just a kid.

553
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,294
She's incredibly thoughtful for a kid.

554
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,663
Hyun Ji was like that too.

555
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:22,994
Ha Yoon and Hyun Ji even talked alike.

556
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,862
Maybe it's because they always hung out together for years.

557
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:28,004
They looked like twins.

558
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,743
After Hyun Ji left,

559
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,973
she must've been more devastated than anyone else,

560
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,844
but she never showed it.

561
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:38,943
One day, I asked her.

562
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:42,113
"Ha Yoon, don't you miss Hyun Ji?"

563
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:44,484
She said she was just holding it all inside...

564
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:49,194
because Young Rim would be sad too if she showed it.

565
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,533
Goodness. Ha Yoon was mindful of things that even this old man...

566
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:55,593
had never thought of.

567
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,334
Right, she's very thoughtful indeed.

568
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:06,143
By the way,

569
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:09,573
you seem quite young.

570
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,512
I look young?

571
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:17,253
Well, I heard you retired...

572
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:19,254
and have been receiving your pension payments.

573
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:24,464
Oh, that. People do say that I look young for my age.

574
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:27,163
Maybe it's because I spent so much time with young students.

575
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,963
Anyway, it's over there.

576
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:33,263
Weed the lawn over there. Please take good care of it.

577
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,533
I should go clean the backyard.

578
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,372
Okay, don't worry. That lawn over there?

579
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:39,803
- Yes, that's it. - Got it.

580
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:54,952
I'm back!

581
00:34:54,953 --> 00:34:56,294
I'm back too.

582
00:34:56,623 --> 00:34:58,593
You two left together in the morning. You came back together too?

583
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,334
Oh, yes.

584
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,834
- What is all that? - We should have dinner.

585
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:08,933
Hey, Jjonga.

586
00:35:09,703 --> 00:35:10,703
Yes?

587
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:12,573
You're going to cook?

588
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,114
Yes.

589
00:35:35,794 --> 00:35:37,763
I can do everything on my own.

590
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:40,803
Just assist me with a couple of things.

591
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:43,004
Says the person who can't even peel potatoes.

592
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:46,543
Can you put spoons and chopsticks on the table?

593
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,814
What? Oh, sure.

594
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:50,214
Chopsticks... Here.

595
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:54,413
Where did the spoons go?

596
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:56,814
I got it.

597
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:01,794
Jjonga, can't you just sit down and relax?

598
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:04,193
The last time you tried to cook,

599
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,424
you burned all the pots, so we had to get new ones.

600
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:08,794
Let me... I got this.

601
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,294
I can do this.

602
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:17,104
Oh, my. Bo Ra, did you really make this from scratch?

603
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,544
I helped her prepare the ingredients.

604
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:22,073
Good. Jjonga, just do that from now on.

605
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,843
Don't cook.

606
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,584
Wook.

607
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,413
I make delicious pasta too.

608
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,754
Bo Ra, is there anything you can't do?

609
00:36:31,053 --> 00:36:32,283
You said you get good grades in school too.

610
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,584
I'm good at everything.

611
00:36:34,254 --> 00:36:36,354
I wish I were bad at something too.

612
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,024
You see, food has to taste good.

613
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,433
All right, let's eat.

614
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:51,073
It's good. Right, Jjonga? Isn't it delicious?

615
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,174
You're not a bad cook.

616
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,314
Oh, right. You guys are free this weekend, right?

617
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,413
If you aren't, cancel your plans. We have somewhere to go.

618
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:02,254
What?

619
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,723
Ta-da. Allow me to introduce...

620
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:13,024
Very Good Coffee's first location.

621
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,194
- Coffee? - So it's a cafe?

622
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:19,334
I've already signed the agreement. Let's go inside.

623
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:22,834
Hey, stop cracking jokes. Why did you bring us here?

624
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,044
What do you think?

625
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:35,453
What? So you're serious?

626
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:37,683
You want to turn this space into a cafe?

627
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:40,694
Yes, an industrial cafe. Don't you know what it is?

628
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:45,024
If we fix it up a little, it'll look amazing.

629
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:47,464
Did you actually sign an agreement already?

630
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:48,992
Yes.

631
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:50,133
Hey, what's wrong with you?

632
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,703
You need to talk to us before you do these things.

633
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:57,243
Let's get out of here. It's so dusty in here.

634
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:00,973
Come on. Let's go!

635
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:08,214
Jong A, where's the restroom?

636
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,114
Over there, around the corner.

637
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:11,384
- Go ahead. - Okay.

638
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:17,263
This building is close to the town where Hyun Ji used to live.

639
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,662
The profits from the cafe...

640
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,093
will help us with the expenses from the work we do to find the people.

641
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:24,263
Nice. Jjonga, you're so smart.

642
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:25,864
I always have a plan.

643
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:28,203
Yesterday was a success too.

644
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:30,472
Yesterday? What did you do yesterday?

645
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:32,503
Goodness. You're clueless, aren't you?

646
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:34,174
I made Bo Ra cook yesterday.

647
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:36,613
After school,

648
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,484
she usually stares at the wall in her room.

649
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:40,614
But I've heard her cry in the room.

650
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:43,484
When she's talking to us, she tries to act tough...

651
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,384
and says that she doesn't need her mother who abandoned her,

652
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:47,694
but she's still a kid, you know.

653
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:51,163

I asked her when I was giving her a ride.

She said she used to cook for her mom at home.

I figured cooking would be better than being in her head all the time.

You could do a paternity test or something.

Her mom disappeared...

I found that on the ground nearby.

786

Does your mom know anyone who lives near Inju?

787

Perhaps a relative or a friend?

788

That's Jjamppong, Munggoon's baby.

805

We don't know who the dad is.

806

Jjamppong. You shouldn't eat that. Good dog.

By the way,

810
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:09,733
what were you and Bo Ra talking about for so long?

811
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,372
I had some stuff to check with her.

812
00:50:12,573 --> 00:50:14,942
We had a photo of an unidentified man.

813
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:16,543
I was wondering if Bo Ra knew who it was.

But that man...

816

seems to have taken Moon Se Young.

817
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,293
Then was Moon Se Young abducted?

818
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,963
Did you tell her that her mom had been abducted?

819
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:35,733
I couldn't tell her that. I didn't want her to be shocked.

- Let me see that picture. - Okay.

- The wedding dress girl? - Yes.

Jung A got out of the wedding shop...

824

and got into this man's car.

01:00:52,543 --> 01:00:54,113
I will. Don't worry.

977
01:00:55,253 --> 01:00:57,552
You don't have to come to class this week.

978
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,383
You'll still be marked as present, though.

979
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:00,983
Okay.

980
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:03,193
Goodbye, then.

981
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,932
Walk with pride.

982
01:01:13,863 --> 01:01:14,903
Straighten your back.

983
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:17,872
Chin up.

984
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:25,073
You gave me a shock. Why'd you come here?

985
01:01:25,213 --> 01:01:26,582
I can do what I want.

986
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:28,412
You came to my place without asking.

987
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:35,222
Are you okay?

988
01:01:37,222 --> 01:01:39,093
Your friends all seem to know.

989
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,793
They would. It was in the news.

990
01:01:43,062 --> 01:01:45,402
Gosh, how could the police change to an open investigation...

991
01:01:45,403 --> 01:01:46,862
just like that, in this day and age?

992
01:01:46,863 --> 01:01:47,863
Goodness.

993
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:49,972
I knew too.

994
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:52,242
You knew?

995
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,742
Yes, I got a call from Detective Shin this morning.

996
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,241
Hello?

997
01:01:58,242 --> 01:02:00,011
Hi, Bo Ra. It's Detective Shin.

998
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,713
So, about finding your mom...

999
01:02:03,613 --> 01:02:05,523
We're thinking of changing it to an open investigation.

1000
01:02:05,952 --> 01:02:09,491
If that happens, your mom's photo will be on the news,

1001
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,653
and everyone at school will find out too.

1002
01:02:12,722 --> 01:02:15,662
Will you find her faster if you do that?

1003
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:17,962
We're not sure.

1004
01:02:17,963 --> 01:02:20,932
But a witness might turn up.

1005
01:02:23,903 --> 01:02:25,742
We won't do it if you don't like the idea.

1006
01:02:27,503 --> 01:02:28,543
Do it.

1007
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:31,073
Please find my mom fast.

1008
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:34,982
He said he needed a family member's consent, so I did.

1009
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:36,883
Then why didn't you call me?

1010
01:02:37,113 --> 01:02:38,511
Jong A said that...

1011
01:02:38,512 --> 01:02:39,952
you didn't like being woken up.

1012
01:02:40,682 --> 01:02:42,922
But this is different.

1013
01:02:42,923 --> 01:02:44,653
You should've called me.

1014
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:47,863
I'm sorry.

1015
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:50,293
Detective Shin is a funny guy.

1016
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,363
Why is he getting consent from a minor instead of the guardian?

1017
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,702
Who's my guardian?

1018
01:02:56,602 --> 01:02:58,943
Of course it's me. Are you seriously asking me that?

1019
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:03,273
I didn't know.

1020
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:10,952
Mr. Jang!

1021
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,382
Goodness.

1022
01:03:13,383 --> 01:03:16,053
You're completely out of breath. Don't run around so fast.

1023
01:03:16,452 --> 01:03:17,922
Isn't Wook here?

1024
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,192
He wasn't at home either.

1025
01:03:19,193 --> 01:03:21,462
I saw him for a bit yesterday, but I haven't seen him since.

1026
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:22,692
I've been here the whole time.

1027
01:03:22,693 --> 01:03:24,391
Then you haven't seen the news either, have you?

1028
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:26,502
Why? Is something the matter?

1029
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,031
No, I'll tell you later.

1030
01:03:28,032 --> 01:03:29,701
I'll go find Wook first.

1031
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:30,702
What?

1032
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,073
Hey, wait...

1033
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:34,372
Why won't he tell me?

1034
01:03:34,803 --> 01:03:36,073
He's just like Wook.

1036
01:03:46,653 --> 01:03:48,692
Jong A will be inside.

1037
01:03:48,693 --> 01:03:50,422
Go home with her, okay?

1038
01:03:50,423 --> 01:03:51,793
I'll stop by somewhere.

1039
01:03:52,093 --> 01:03:53,093
Where?

1040
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,391
Well, I'll go see Mr. Jang and stuff.

1041
01:03:55,392 --> 01:03:57,062
- Wook, did you see the news? - What?

1042
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,762
I didn't say anything.

1043
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:03,931
The news about a missing woman in her 30s.

1044
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:05,273
I saw her myself.

1045
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:07,972
Get lost.

1046
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:09,871
I know who took her too.

1047
01:04:09,872 --> 01:04:12,543
It was one of the guys who abducted the woman in the wedding dress.

1048
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,811
I know that too.

1049
01:04:14,812 --> 01:04:15,983
What do you know?

1050
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:20,483
There's nobody here. Who are you talking to?

1051
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:23,221
We couldn't save the woman in the wedding dress,

1052
01:04:23,222 --> 01:04:25,222
but we might be able to save this woman.

1053
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:29,562
Apparently, she has a young daughter too.

1054
01:04:51,483 --> 01:04:52,582
This is it?

1055
01:04:53,883 --> 01:04:55,082
This is where Se Young was?

1056
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:57,553
Yes.

1057
01:04:58,293 --> 01:05:00,862
Please let me see my daughter just once.

1058
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:01,863
Please.

1059
01:05:02,093 --> 01:05:04,662
Let me see my Bo Ra just once.

1060
01:05:04,963 --> 01:05:06,502
Is anyone there?

1061
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,503
Is anyone there? Please help me!

1062
01:05:08,702 --> 01:05:09,932
She was inside the trunk,

1063
01:05:10,332 --> 01:05:13,273
begging to let her see her daughter just once.

1064
01:05:18,242 --> 01:05:19,383
Who are you?

1065
01:05:21,843 --> 01:05:24,113
- What do you mean? - The voice phishing scammer murder.

1066
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:26,622
The abduction and murder of the woman in the wedding dress.

1067
01:05:27,082 --> 01:05:28,423
And now, Se Young's abduction too.

1068
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:30,693
You were there every time.

1069
01:05:34,293 --> 01:05:35,762
Don't you think it's weird too?

1070
01:05:41,332 --> 01:05:43,472
It was part of your plan to approach me, wasn't it?

1071
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,242
And what if it was?

1072
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:54,383
Why, you...

1073
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:00,923
Look who it is.

1074
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:05,193
It is you.

Right?

I almost didn't recognize you with longer hair.

No.

Just 3 hours. Just give me 3 hours.
