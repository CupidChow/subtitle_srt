Who are you?

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,460
Tell me who you are.

4
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,229
Who sent you?

5
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Was it Lee Dong Min?

6
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:30,530
Answer me, you scum.

7
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,470
Bo Ra.

8
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,639
- Do you know me? - Of course, I know you.

9
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,479
Who are you, mister?

10
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:19,649
Me?

11
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,779
I'm...

12
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,249
Let's just say I'm your dad's friend.

13
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:27,190
Okay, so?

14
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,559
What do you mean, so?

15
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,830
Take your friends out for a nice dinner.

16
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,799
No, it's okay.

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,739
You can accept what adults give you as a gift.

18
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,079
Take it.

19
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:52,979
Bo Ra.

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,750
- Hey. - Are you okay?

21
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,448
- Who... - Who are you...

Do you know him?

24
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,199
Don't you dare talk to the kid again.

25
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,169
What a weirdo.

26
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,699
Let's go.

27
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,549
Bo Ra has a pretty interesting older sister.

28
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,919
Hey.

29
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,889
Good job.

30
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,489
Take your buddies out to eat. It's on me.

31
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,040
A woman we've never met...

32
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,280
appears in my dreams...

33
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,810
and you say she looks familiar.

34
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,949
It could be a coincidence.

35
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,919
Do you still believe in coincidences?

36
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,889
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

37
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,489
Didn't I tell you about Duon Village?

38
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,329
I ended up there because of a woman I happened to meet in the street.

39
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,699
I met my mom there.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,799
It turned out that woman...

41
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,169
was involved in my mom's death.

42
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,269
Everything in the world happens for a reason.

43
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,678
I will find out why I can see and visit...

44
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,509
Industrial Complex Three.

45
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,350
So you too should find out why this is happening to you.

46
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,190
This is it.

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,798
I guess no one's home yet.

48
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,369
Shall I go inside?

49
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,210
Goodness.

50
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,379
You said you'd never enter strangers' homes.

51
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:07,379
This isn't considered invasion of privacy.

52
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,479
Our lives depend on this.

53
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:15,460
Okay.

54
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,559
Tell me if you see anything suspicious, whatever it is.

55
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:22,260
From the wallpaper patterns to the light bulbs, check everything.

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Will do.

57
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,510
- What's wrong? - Hold on.

58
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,989
I can't enter this house.

59
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,999
Hang on. Let me try.

60

Wook.

61
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,488
- What is that? - It must be an alarm.

62
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:22,119
You didn't check for one?

63
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,890
Get down first.

64
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,929
Run away, quick.

65
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,660

I'm fine.

Did anything happen? Shall we make a police report?

Don't.

72
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,200
Nothing happened.

73
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
I guess someone set it off by mistake.

74
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,839
Are you really okay?

75
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,049
Yes. You can go.

The kids left a huge empty space.

It's cold outside and my heart feels empty too.

81

I thought you'd stopped coming when I hadn't seen you in days.

82

If you'd stopped coming because your kid's friends crossed over,

I was going to spray a bag of salt at the entrance...

and curse you out.

That's why I'm here.

88
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,619
I feel empty too, like a single dad who married off a daughter.

89
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,989
You spent over ten years with them and must feel even worse.

I thought we could mope together.

I buried my husband and son when I was alive,

Good for you.

Jong Yoon.

102
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,569
He was my husband's neighbor as kids.

103
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,000
They were like brothers.

104

He heard my husband fished,

105

so he quit his job to move back and fish together.

We're not related but we're family.

If it hadn't been for him and his wife,

I'd have died at least five years sooner.

Isn't it nice to have someone when you're feeling down?

You bet.

Why do you think I became Captain Kang?

I owe that to Jong Yoon.

Eun Sil, come and eat!

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,178
- Hurry. - It'll get soggy.

143
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,479
- Get over here. - Be quick!

144
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,520
That was 35 years ago already.

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,088
They've been mourning you since then?

146
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,688
Yes. Il Yong told me after one of his strolls.

147
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,859
They set us a table on holidays...

148
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,400
and mourn my husband and son on their death anniversary.

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,770
They even mourn me on mine.

150
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:37,469
They must be in their 70s now. It can't be easy.

151
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,168
Do you want me to go and thank them?

No, don't.

153

Will you say a ghost sent you?

154
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,979
You'll kill the old folk with shock.

155
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,178
Well, I'll just say that I'm your distant relative.

156
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,880
I may not look it, but I'm actually a great actor.

157
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,549
My goodness. Thank you for the offer.

158
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,559
I'm so grateful for everyone in my life.

Oh, it's fine.

161

It hurts for a day or two when my death anniversary rolls around.

162
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:08,299
But after that, it completely goes away.

163
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:10,699
I guess...

164
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,339
the fish in the sea ate my legs first when I fell in the water.

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,120
Were there other places you could not enter in the past?

167
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,419
No, none.

168
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,499
Did someone cast a magic spell so the dead wouldn't be able to enter?

169
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,900
Garlic and a silver cross?

170
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,699
Or some kind of talisman?

171
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,040
What? Are you a vampire?

172
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,540
I'm not a vampire, but I am a mutant.

173
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,910
Unlike the others, I can leave the village.

174
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,020
And I can see things the others can't see.

175
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:00,089
Your life has gotten complicated since you met me.

176
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,260
My life was already complicated even before I met you.

177
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,099
If you can't enter that house, I will.

178
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,400
After all, I should meet the woman I saw in my dream.

179
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,569
Il Yong.

180
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,679
We're both mutants, so we got this.

181
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,880
I also see things that others can't see.

182
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,650
Thanks.

183
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,390
That's it?

184
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,929
Hey, Jong A.

185
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:43,699
What?

186
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,240
Do you recognize this face?

187
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,610
I don't know who he is.

188
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,848
When I asked him who he was,

189
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,650
he said, "Let's just say I'm your dad's friend."

190
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,419
He even knew Bo Ra's name.

191
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,290
Okay. I'll ask Detective Shin to look into this.

192
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:12,760
You must've been scared.

193
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,500
Not really, because Jong A came to my rescue.

194
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,870
- Oh, my. - Well done, Jong A.

195
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,199
Bo Ra.

196
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,639
You have to go to school tomorrow. You should go to bed early.

197
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,910
Oh, right. I'll pick you up starting tomorrow.

198
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,640
Come down when I call you.

199
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,449
Okay. Good night.

200
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,549
- You too. - Sweet dreams.

201
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,290
Who is that guy?

202
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:44,089
I heard Bo Ra's mother had been looking for a house.

203
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,959
Do you think we can let her move out?

204
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,959
I think it's safer to have her stay with us...

205
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,169
until we find out exactly who this man is.

206
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,569
Okay.

207
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,969
I'll talk to Se Young.

208
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:01,169
Tomorrow, I need to take you both somewhere.

209
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,010
- Where? - Where?

210
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,160
Over there?

211
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,069
Well, I only see the passersby. What else do you see?

212
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,069
I don't see anything.

213
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,910
Me neither.

214
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,780
But apparently, some dead people live there.

215
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,049
And it's where Alice's mother is.

216
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,849
It's floating up there?

217
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,660
So this is the third village we know of.

218
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,760
How many more places like this exist?

219
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,329
How come there are so many people whose bodies haven't been found?

220
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,829
Anyway, what on earth happened to Alice and her mother?

221
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,839
Her mother is a foreigner who married a Korean man.

222
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,609
Alice's father hit her mother...

223
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,410
for not speaking Korean well.

224
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,409
When Alice started crying, he hit her too.

225
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,980
When the mother tried to stop him, he hit her again.

226
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,548
A jerk like him deserves to...

227
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:15,219
He should get his hands cut off.

228
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,650
Exactly.

229
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,349
Where is he now?

230
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,790
Il Yong visited their address,

231
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,959
but he already got rid of everything and fled the country.

232
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,959
I will find him, no matter where he is.

233
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,929
You nearly died.

234
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:34,669
Hey, we cops get stabbed from time to time.

235
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,338
Gosh, help me up.

236
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,169
Hey, don't get up. Just lie down.

237
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,239
Oh, boy.

238
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,910
How dare he stab a cop in the parking lot at the police station?

239
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,109
He was wearing the police uniform, right?

240
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,150
Did you see his face?

241
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,549
Yes.

242
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,020
Who sent you?

243
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,849
Answer me, you jerk.

244
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,120
I've seen him before.

245
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,929
There was someone else behind me.

246
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,360
I think that person stabbed me.

247
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,500
Oh, that's right. You were stabbed from behind.

248
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,000
I thought it was odd.

249
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,069
It wasn't a one-person job.

250
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:17,338
Oh, Ms. Lee. Don't buy the coffee beans...

251
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,480
that Wook suggested the other day.

252
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,679
- Why not? - They taste awful.

253
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:24,049
What? They taste great.

254
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:25,449
Yes.

255
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,489
Many people discover the cafe on social media...

256
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,659
and come to check it out.

257
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,759
Everyone says the coffee is good.

258
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,790
- Seriously? - Yes.

259
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,130
I thought it tasted weird.

260
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,359
Hey, you said you were stepping out to see Detective Shin.

261
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,160
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

262
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:41,799
Goodness. Speak of the devil.

263
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,170
Hey, Detective Shin.

264
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:57,785
Hi, there you are.

265
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:03,484
You seem totally fine.

266
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,295
- What? - What? Is this a setup?

267
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,724
Why are you here?

268
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,224
- What's wrong with you? - Ouch. I got stabbed.

269
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,565
Gosh.

270
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:13,565
Goodness.

271
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:15,865
What happened?

272
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,804
Remember the people who tailed us...

273
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,774
when we went to the club?

274
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,473
They were hiding in the parking lot at the police station.

275
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,504
Why did they go to you?

276
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:28,574
You know, the tracker you put on them.

277
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,885
- The GPS tracker? - Yes.

278
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:33,454
It was found in the woods.

279
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,115
And...

280
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:38,125
Kim Pil Joong's body was found near it.

281
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,565
Don't tell me it was Jang Do Ri.

282
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,934
It was staged to look like a suicide,

283
00:18:47,664 --> 00:18:49,204
but I think it was Jang Do Ri.

284
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,775
Like you said,

285
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:58,344
Jang Do Ri met up with Kim Pil Joong...

286
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,714
after he visited Lee Dong Min in jail.

287
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,645
To verify it, I visited Lee Dong Min myself...

288
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,214
and asked him...

289
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,085
if he was dealing drugs in jail.

290
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,885
Asked who? Lee Dong Min?

291
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,484
My goodness.

292
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,395
Oh, boy. Then you got stabbed?

293
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,895
Was it Lee Dong Min, then?

294
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:19,734
For now, it's just a speculation.

295
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,064
We don't have evidence.

296
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,835
Clearly, it was Lee Dong Min.

297
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,234
That jerk.

298
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:28,334
It's not like I can send him to jail again when he's already behind bars.

299
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,145
I've already contacted the Drug Squad.

300
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,914
It's their case too, so they should help us.

301
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:36,045
Mr. Kim Wook, you be careful too.

302
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:39,615
They're ruthless jerks.

303
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,254
Was it yesterday?

304
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:45,125
Someone visited Bo Ra when she was at the academy.

305
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:47,025
Who?

306
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:51,224
Here.

307
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,934
This guy. I don't know who he is.

308
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,904
If you don't know him...

309
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,274
Does he have something to do with Moon Se Young?

310
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,635
No, not at all.

311
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:05,973
Apparently, he said he was my friend.

312
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,315
But I don't know this guy.

313
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:11,484
Do you think he could be connected to those jerks?

314
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,055
Hye Ju.

315
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:21,424
Yes!

316
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,664
Oh, boy. Hi.

317
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,404
My gosh. That's a lot of ginger.

318
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:32,275
Do you need my help?

319
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,335
No, it's all good.

320
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,703
The ginger looks very fresh.

321
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,314
It's cold these days.

322
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:43,244
I want to make ginger tea and give it to the kids when they cough.

323
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:45,285
Would you like some too?

324
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:48,285
I've never had a cold since I came here.

325
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,654
It's a good hangover cure.

326
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,224
I guess everyone knows that I like to drink.

327
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,493
But what brought you here?

328
00:20:58,494 --> 00:20:59,964
Oh, my. I must be out of it.

329
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,635
I totally forgot why I came here.

330
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:07,434
It's nothing big, but I just wanted to see if you were okay.

331
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:09,875
Me?

332
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:19,615
You took care of Ha Yoon all this time...

333
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:23,254
with such devotion.

334
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,024
When Ha Yoon got scared because of Choi Young Bae,

335
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,125
you stayed by her side and nursed her all night long.

336
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,295
All I did was sit next to her.

337
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,334
She didn't even eat anything...

338
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:35,164
until Young Rim showed up. Then she started to play and laugh.

339
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:36,704
Right.

340
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,375
If one cries,

341
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,944
the other one would comfort them.

342
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:47,775
They would get into a fight, but then, a little later,

343
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,514
they'd be on the same side again.

344
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,625
Now that Ha Yoon and Young Rim have gone,

345
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:03,125
the house feels so empty.

346
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:09,264
Still, it's a good thing.

347
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:19,744
Oh, right.

348
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:23,484
Last time, Wook and Il Yong...

349
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,785
gathered the villagers and asked everyone to write down...

350
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,454
where they lived...

351
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:32,285
and whether they were curious about their families on the outside.

352
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:34,624
They did a big thing.

353
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,625
Everyone is so thankful to them.

354
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,795
But why didn't you write anything down, Hye Ju?

355
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:49,004
Your father is healthy and doing well, so don't worry.

356
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,474
How do you know that?

357
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:56,145
I have my ways of knowing.

358
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,355
So trust me.

359
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,224
Just hearing that makes me feel better.

360
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:11,194
Well,

361
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,464
you already told me everything.

362
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:17,164
That my parents are doing well.

363
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,275
That's all I need.

364
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,645
I knew you'd be here.

365
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:32,785
Can you still not go in?

366
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:36,224
This place must be somewhere I can never enter.

367
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:45,494
Hello?

368
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,434
Is anyone home?

369
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:50,065
There hasn't been any sign of people since earlier.

370
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:56,875
This house is the only one with a security system...

371
00:23:58,305 --> 00:23:59,474
on this entire street.

372
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:01,375
Isn't it weird?

373
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:05,115
The exterior is shabby, but they're so protective.

374
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,865
Why do you go around getting stabbed?

375
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:22,834
How badly did you get hurt?

376
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:26,575
Well, the blade avoided my organs, so I'm fine.

377
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,075
As if.

378
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,144
I saw the text.

379
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:33,244
The guy who stabbed you is related to Goliath?

380
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:34,545
Yes.

381
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:37,014
I think it was that guy who killed Kim Pil Joong.

382
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:40,184
Why would the guy who killed Kim Pil Joong stab you?

383
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:45,085
To tell you the conclusion first,

384
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:47,395
it's related to Lee Dong Min.

385
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,125
Lee Dong Min?

386
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:52,065
Lee Dong Min of Choiseung Constructions?

387
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,234
He's in jail now.

388
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:57,164
Yes.

389
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:01,734
Dong Min?

390
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:03,703
You've been in the Philippines.

391
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,275
I was wondering how you two knew each other.

392
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,785
I've known him for about 30 years.

393
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:13,254
Is that so? That's a long time.

394
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,624
I used to do track and field when I was younger.

395
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,694
I quit when I injured my Achilles' tendon.

396
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,664
My family was poor,

397
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,064
I had never studied in my life,

398
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,365
and I had to quit being an athlete. I had nothing to do.

399
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,134
So I barely managed to graduate high school...

400
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:32,835
and was doing manual labor on construction sites.

401
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:35,135
Then that guy came to see me.

402
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:37,474
I think he must've recognized your talent.

403
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,045
I'm sure he looked into me.

404
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,375
He said he liked me because we were similar people.

405
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:44,743
That guy passed the bar exam...

406
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,754
and started working at Choiseung Constructions.

407
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,584
And I was building apartments...

408
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:51,184
at Choiseung's construction sites.

409
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:54,825
What was the similarity between us?

410
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:58,994
We had no one to support us, had no family to take care of,

411
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:02,095
and do whatever it takes once we have a goal in mind.

412
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:06,305
My goal is simple.

413
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:09,234
Both then and now,

414
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,444
it's money.

415
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,514
Especially, back then, I was desperate to make a living.

416
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,514
I did whatever I could make money from.

417
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,385
I didn't want to know the reason.

418
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:26,424
Wook...

419
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:29,395
Wook...

420
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,164
I just had to do what I was told to and got my paycheck.

421
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:41,105
I took care of my job perfectly, and he managed the money perfectly.

422
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,105
We worked together pretty well.

423
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,684
But that doesn't mean we're similar people.

424
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:54,785
We ask for your cooperation.

425
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:09,934
There is one thing I learned for sure from that guy.

426
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:13,204
There is nothing you can't do for money.

427
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:15,775
Wherever that is.

428
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,864
- Hey. - What?

429
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,164
Hey, Lee Dong Min!

430
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:50,474
What on earth is going on?

431
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:51,904
Call an ambulance.

432
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:53,645
Wook.

433
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,514
Hey.

434
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,914
Detective Shin is in the hospital with an injury.

435
00:27:58,845 --> 00:27:59,954
How did it happen?

436
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:02,653
Is he badly hurt? We should go visit him in the hospital.

437
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:03,723
That's right.

438
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,324
It's Detective Shin of all people. We can't just sit back and relax.

439
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:07,855
He told us not to visit him.

440
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,895
He was stabbed.

441
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:13,034
Thankfully, none of his organs were damaged.

442
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,565
Who did such a thing?

443
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:16,404
Well...

444
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,734
I think it was one of Lee Dong Min's cronies.

445
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,305
Who? Lee Dong Min?

446
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:26,243
The police are investigating now,

447
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:27,443
and Detective Shin says he'll be discharged soon,

448
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,444
so we shouldn't worry.

449
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:35,684
By the way, did you find where Alice's dad ran off to?

450
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:38,625
Yes. His name is Lee Chun Bum.

451
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:40,254
He fled to Guam.

452
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,365
I'm not sure how we can get him.

453
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:48,135
How much does it cost to fly to Guam?

454
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:54,605
Bo Ra.

455
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:57,244
What? Are you working out?

456
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:01,713
Hey, it's cold. Why are you out here by yourself?

457
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:02,944
You'll catch a cold.

458
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,384
Aren't you being overly protective?

459
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:08,284
Hey, it's true that it's cold.

460
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:10,223
How is that being overly protective?

461
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,384
I mean, you drop me off in the morning...

462
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:12,525
and pick me up after my lessons.

463
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:15,493
You text a hundred times in between, asking if everything's all right.

464
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:17,723
And when I get home, you give me juice and fruit,

465
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,095
and now you even put a blanket on me.

466
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:22,835
I'm really fine.

467
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:25,865
Okay.

468
00:29:27,135 --> 00:29:31,605
If anything feels the least bit weird,

469
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:34,575
tell me anytime. Okay?

470
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,314
- Okay. - All right, let's go inside.

471
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,014
Is your strategy meeting over for the day?

472
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,314
What strategy meeting?

473
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:43,683
Don't the three of you hold strategy meetings,

474
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,525
then set out to catch bad guys?

475
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:48,394
What are you talking about?

476
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,194
I'm not completely clueless.

477
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:53,034
That serial killer who was on the news a few days ago.

478
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:55,535
That person was caught after you guys set out too.

479
00:29:56,704 --> 00:29:58,805
Oh, that was...

480
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,304
We just happened to find something out about that.

481
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:04,105
You're a Brave Citizen, Dad.

482
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:06,214
You caught a voice phishing fraud too.

483
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,615
Of course. I'm a Brave Citizen.

484
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:14,315
I think you, Jjonga, and Mr. Jang are all super cool.

485
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,224
Can't I help you catch bad guys too?

486
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:24,963
- What? - I learned from Jjonga last time.

487
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:28,135
I'm confident that I can search news articles and sort the material.

488
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,634
Didn't you say you had an exam next week?

489
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:37,004
But you said...

490
00:30:37,204 --> 00:30:38,903
that studying isn't all there is to life.

491
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:41,315
But a student should fulfill her duties.

492
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:43,184
Come on. Let's go inside and study.

493
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:47,413
Gosh, it's cold.

494
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:49,684
It hasn't been this cold in a while.

495
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:53,095
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

496
00:30:57,865 --> 00:30:59,164
Hello, everyone.

497
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,595
- What? - Hi.

498
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,564
Hold on a second. Why are you back so soon?

499
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,434
I told you to take a few sick days.

500
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:08,934
I was itching to move around.

501
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:10,944
The wound might get infected.

502
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,775
I'll be fine as long as I take my medication.

503
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:15,244
Lying down all day was making me even worse.

504
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:17,513
The security footage from the parking lot...

505
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:18,844
and dash cam footage...

506
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:20,055
have been handed to Man Soo.

507
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,484
That's what you ordered.

508
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:24,954
Yes, I'm sure they're connected to Goliath.

509
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:30,424
- Hello. - Mr. Jang!

510
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,395
What brings you by?

511
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:34,964
I'm here to report a missing person.

512
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,404
Did something happen to Wook?

513
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:39,004
No.

514
00:31:39,635 --> 00:31:42,075
- Hold on, Detective Shin. - Yes?

515
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,105
I heard you were injured.

516
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,875
Are you all right?

517
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,574
Yes, I'm fine.

518
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,844
This darn little brat wouldn't listen...

519
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:54,013
even though I told him to rest for a few days.

520
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:55,585
- Mr. Jang, with me. - Sure.

521
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:58,683
- Can I get you a beverage? - Instant coffee mix for me.

522
00:31:58,684 --> 00:31:59,795
- Sure. - Good.

523
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:03,325
Lee Alice and Na Soo Jin?

524
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:06,295
That's right. The child is from a multicultural family,

525
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:08,795
and Na Soo Jin is Alice's mom.

526
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,004
The dad's name is Lee Chun Bum.

527
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:13,473
I know them from the foundation I volunteer at.

528
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:16,474
I teach Korean to children from multicultural families,

529
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:19,504
and Alice hasn't come by recently.

530
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,075
Her mother is nowhere to be seen.

531
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:24,514
According to the neighbors,

532
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:28,355
the father took them all overseas.

533
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:31,324
But leaving without saying goodbye?

534
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,954
That's just as weird.

535
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:36,724
Captain, should I look up their travel records?

536
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:38,065
Sure.

537
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,494
Is she one of the students that learn Korean from you?

538
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:46,064
No, not directly. But I have seen her once or twice.

539
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:50,075
Gosh, she's an adorable one with big sparkling eyes.

540
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,944
I mean... I've never seen her mom though.

541
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:59,345
What is the father like? Lee Chun Bum, did you say?

542
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:01,084
Rumor has it...

543
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:03,724
that he has quite the temper.

544
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,654
Lee Chun Bum left for Guam a month ago,

545
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:09,994
but there's no record of the others leaving the country.

546
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:18,164
Detective Yoo, why don't you run point on this one?

547
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,174
Detective Shin, for the time being, you'll be on desk duty.

548
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,575
I don't want you popping any stitches.

549
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,744
- Mr. Jang, you... - Actually,

550
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:30,045
I'm busy and should go.

551
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:32,614
Detective Yoo, I thank you in advance.

552
00:33:32,615 --> 00:33:33,815
I only ask for your best work.

553
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:36,355
- Have a good day, then. - Wait. My coffee.

554
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:38,625
Have a good day.

555
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:44,395
I'm dying to know where he gets his information.

556
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:46,124
That's not important...

557
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,534
compared to us finding those missing.

558
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:56,945
What?

559
00:33:58,145 --> 00:33:59,204
You're here.

560
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:04,414
Can I get two bottles of makgeolli?

561
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,884
You already took some yesterday.

562
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,925
That's because I couldn't go to sleep.

563
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,295
What about today?

564
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:15,655
Are you planning a nap?

565
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,795
Maybe it's because I'm lame,

566
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:23,905
but I feel heavy-hearted.

567
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,315
We'll drink together.

568
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:38,715
Let's see how wasted we can get.

569
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:41,954
Must you make me feel guilty?

570
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:44,525
I already regret telling you...

571
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:47,925
since it only made you upset.

572
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:52,264
Do you have any idea how jealous I was of you...

573
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:53,934
and how much I respected you?

574
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:57,405
You were an honorable man with heaps of knowledge...

575
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:01,304
who made us laugh and cry with words that touched the heart.

576
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:05,045
Now, all I see is a pitiful man.

577
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,114
I'm lame, aren't I?

578
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:13,155
Yes, you are.

579
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,214
As a parent myself,

580
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:19,054
I understand where you're coming from.

581
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:22,295
But I don't know what you're doing...

582
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:24,824
is actually right for your son.

583
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,045
Save the makgeolli.

584
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,744
I'll have it some other time.

585
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:02,664
Jjamppong.

586
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,204
Alice, don't run too fast.

587
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:11,304
Look at you run.

588
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:12,875
There you go.

589
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:18,085
Alice's dad Lee Chun Bum...

590
00:36:18,645 --> 00:36:20,215
fled to Guam.

591
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:23,884
Can't he be caught, then?

592
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,823
Can you go to Alice's mom...

593
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:28,824
and ask if Lee Chun Bum has friends or family in Guam?

594
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:30,224
Got it.

595
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:34,164
Jjamppong.

596
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,934
Alice has fully adapted to her life here.

597
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,105
She cried a lot at first...

598
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,744
and didn't even eat.

599
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,574
I went to the park when Alice first got here.

600
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:52,085
Nothing was visible at first,

601
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:54,585
but then I saw a building which is why I entered it.

602
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:59,354
The first one to approach me was Alice's mom.

603
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:00,554
Have you seen a little girl?

604
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:02,454
No?

605
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,993
Excuse me, have you seen my daughter?

606
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:09,033
Sorry?

607
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:11,864
She was here a minute ago, but now I don't see her.

608
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:17,045
Is that so? But I only just got here myself.

609
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:18,974
Who is your daughter?

610
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:23,215
A little girl by the name of Alice.

611
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:24,884
She's about this tall...

612
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:27,054
and has a bob haircut.

613
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,284
Her eyes are big and round...

614
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:31,484
Alice? Is she missing a tooth?

615
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:34,395
Yes, that's right. Where's my baby?

616
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,824
The building must be visible to me...

617
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,864
because of Alice's mom.

618
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,534
Mr. Jang can see this village because of Hyun Ji.

619
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:47,974
And you can probably see this village...

620
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:52,145
because of me.

621
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:59,184
I've been looking for you, you see.

622
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:03,655
You were looking for me?

623
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,054
How were they able to see the dead though?

624
00:38:09,994 --> 00:38:10,994
What I know for certain...

625
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,134
is that they both deeply missed someone.

626
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,704
Excuse me.

627
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:20,904
- I didn't know where to find you. - Hold on.

628
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:21,974
Can't you see me?

629
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,945
I blindly roamed the streets for a year.

630
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:29,074
I was that desperate.

631
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:31,614
At the beginning,

632
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:34,284
I wanted to find Pil Joong who had killed me...

633
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:38,355
and then my body.

634
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:40,125
But now,

635
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,594
I just want to know why.

636
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:46,695
Why am I different from the others that are dead?

637
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:49,795
There are no coincidences in this world.

638
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:51,835
You told me that, remember?

639
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:55,175
Of course.

640
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:58,175
Right.

641
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:00,714
No way.

642
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,973
I was right, wasn't I?

643
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,045
I told you that it was planned from the start.

644
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:09,855
But then again, I feel bad for Mr. Oh.

645
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:13,283
For a year, he tried to find someone who could hear him...

646
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,395
by talking to people who couldn't.

647
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:17,764
Tell me about it.

648
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:20,734
I also feel terrible to hear that Thomas...

649
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,235
is still at Duon Village.

650
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:28,474
But thanks to him, we were able to meet Il Yong.

651
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:32,804
It seems like fate, if you ask me.

652
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,974
We went to a house recently,

653
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:36,675
but Il Yong...

654
00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:39,085
couldn't breach it.

655
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:41,985
Is there a place he can't go into?

656
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:45,284
That's the only place.

657
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:48,354
The house is worn down and tattered...

658
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:49,855
but has a serious alarm system.

659
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:52,664
Do you know the address?

660
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:54,695
Yes, I wrote it down.

661
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:57,804
Here.

662
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:01,875
(Guji-ro, Jinseon-gu, Seoul)

663
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:07,244
It has been rented out...

664
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:08,815
to a Jin Hee Jung.

665
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,784
Could that be her name?

666
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:13,215
Did you meet her in person?

667
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,384
No, I randomly came across her recently.

668
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,295
I kept ringing the bell, but nobody answered the door.

669
00:40:20,695 --> 00:40:23,625
There must be something up with that house.

670
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:30,735
By the way, I saw Detective Shin at the police station.

671
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,703
Why did you go there?

672
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:34,304
To do my work, of course.

673
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:36,275
He must've already been discharged.

674
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:38,303
It seemed like it.

675
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:40,914
Detective Baek made sure he was bound to his desk.

676
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:43,013
It must be because you're young,

677
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:45,384
but you and Detective Shin think you're invincible.

678
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,315
- Yes. - Wait until you're my age.

679
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:50,054
You need to watch your health.

680
00:40:52,554 --> 00:40:53,925
Hey, that's mine.

681
00:40:54,695 --> 00:40:56,625
You said last time I could have some.

682
00:40:57,264 --> 00:41:00,663
You should still ask the owner for permission.

683
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:03,065
I'll let you off because it's you.

684
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,164
You both need to watch your joints before it's too late.

685
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:12,974
Lee Dong Min died in prison.

686
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:15,914
- What? - Last night,

687
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:18,945
I went there to search his cell.

688
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:20,884
He'd killed himself.

689
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:24,084
Lee Dong Min's not the type to kill himself.

690
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,255
Exactly.

691
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,894
To suicide a guy in solitary confinement,

692
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,823
how many in there do you think got together?

693
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:32,964
Stabbing a cop at a police station is a piece of cake to them.

694
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:35,195
It could get really dangerous for you.

695
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:49,445
I don't have anyone here.

696
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:54,784
I enjoy eating and traveling alone.

697
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,925
So, is there any news on Oh Il Yong?

698
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,024
Hey,

699
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:03,125
stop!

700
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:06,025
Do you think I'm bored because I'm always traveling?

701
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:08,664
You know why I'm here.

702
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,905
Wake up.

703
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:16,835
Excuse me. Could you take a photo of us?

704
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:34,324
You're even cuter now that you eat so well.

705
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:36,855
Captain, done.

706
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:39,364
"I'm done." That's what you say.

707
00:42:39,494 --> 00:42:40,633
I'm done.

708
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:42,764
Okay. You can go and play.

709
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:46,634
You should eat too.

710
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,175
I am eating.

711
00:42:48,704 --> 00:42:50,945
At your age, you digest everything right away.

712
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:55,974
I remember when I first came here.

713
00:42:56,514 --> 00:42:59,145
I didn't even know I was dead and I ate.

714
00:42:59,684 --> 00:43:02,184
Hearing that I'd died while I was eating...

715
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:03,985
made it feel unreal.

716
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:05,783
I guess...

717
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:08,954
you could say it made death feel more natural to me.

718
00:43:10,695 --> 00:43:12,094
You got that now?

719
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:15,494
What? Was it your ploy?

720
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:17,835
A ploy's too serious a word.

721
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:21,033
I wanted you to realize dying...

722
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:24,275
isn't a big deal so you should eat and move on.

723
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:26,545
Comrade Jung said...

724
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:29,275
people don't become useless when they die.

725
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,815
They die when they realize they mean nothing.

726
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:36,084
I'm not that great with words,

727
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:37,655
so I just do what I can.

728
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,484
"Eat, and cheer up."

729
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:41,655
"Even in death, you can live on here."

730
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,324
You're pretty eloquent.

731
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:47,664
Finish your food.

732
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:50,565
Put the empty bowl in the kitchen.

733
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:53,404
- Or do the dishes too. - Where are you going?

734
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:55,804
To bring Mr. Jung some makgeolli.

735
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,045
Here.

736
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,974
Have a drink if you can't sleep.

737
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,215
No, thanks.

738
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:08,654
I can't rely on alcohol forever.

739
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:10,215
You said you feel tormented.

740
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:14,755
Like you said,

741
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:18,025
I'm reflecting if I did the right thing...

742
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:20,295
for my son as a parent.

743
00:44:21,065 --> 00:44:24,565
If I rely on makgeolli, I'll compromise and stop thinking.

744
00:44:25,134 --> 00:44:27,204
I think I'll hide away.

745
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:34,315
Is that another way of saying you won't drink makgeolli tonight?

746
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:38,744
You're great at getting to the point.

747
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:43,085
I came all the way here for nothing.

748
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,054
Goodnight.

749
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,494
I need to put Alice to bed.

750
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:50,224
Captain Kang.

751
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:55,034
Thank you.

752
00:44:57,204 --> 00:44:58,304
Don't thank me.

753
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,005
Stop calling me and go inside.

754
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,243
Goodness. You actually did the dishes?

755
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:43,614
You told me to.

756
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:47,684
I told you ages ago and these are still here?

757
00:45:48,014 --> 00:45:49,254
Well,

758
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:51,453
Alice and I played with some dolls,

759
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:53,754
then I put her to bed when she yawned.

760
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:55,224
I just got started.

761
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,263
You whine too much.

762
00:45:57,264 --> 00:45:59,624
I wasn't whining.

763
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:00,993
Look, Captain.

764
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:04,133
People would think I'm the designated dishwasher.

765
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:05,834
Okay, fine. I'll do the rest.

766
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:07,473
No, it's fine.

767
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,074
I was kidding. Get some rest.

768
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:13,574
There is quite a lot of stuff to wash, though.

769
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:16,374
That's because you talk more than you actually wash.

770
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,343
There aren't that many.

771
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:19,783
- Move. - No.

772
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:22,113
- I'll move like a machine. - No.

773
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:23,413
- Nice and clean. - No.

774
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,024
This should be done slowly.

775
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:26,953
- Clean this one first. - Why?

776
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,355
Let's have some makgeolli.

777
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:30,254
- Gosh... - Sit down.

778
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,764
You need to stop drinking.

779
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:55,985
The reason she keeps appearing in my dreams.

780
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:00,954
The reason Il Yong can't enter that house.

781
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:07,235
You can see this place because of me, right?

782
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:10,335
You said that there are...

783
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:12,634
no coincidences.

784
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:16,375
How did you know he's Kim Pil Joong?

785
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:20,445
The ring he's wearing. Il Yong wore the same one.

786
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:23,244
Darn it.

787
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:26,585
The thing...

788
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:31,925
I saw in my dream...

789
00:47:58,186 --> 00:47:59,655
Hello!

790
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:02,186
Hello.

791
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:07,425
Isn't this nice?

792
00:48:09,566 --> 00:48:11,166
You have something on Oh Il Yong?

793
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:13,195
Yes. Take a look at this.

794
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:17,836
I found it on Kim Pil Joong's phone.

795
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:20,806
They were up to no good.

796
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:24,815
Send me the address. I must see for myself.

797
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:25,876
Okay.

798
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:30,956
I like your style.

799
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:33,615
- Take care! - Good...

800
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:35,655
Goodbye!

801
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:40,355
Don't even ask.

802
00:48:40,356 --> 00:48:42,266
"There are so many, my back hurts."

803
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:45,336
I'd had no idea he was so chatty.

804
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,066
I see.

805
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:51,536
The thing is, though,

806
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:54,445
he said so much,

807
00:48:55,606 --> 00:48:58,445
but he didn't say a word about himself.

808
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:02,186
He doesn't eat much either.

809
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:06,686
His face is overcast and I think something's bothering him.

810
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:10,485
I'll cook something energizing...

811
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:13,226
to get him to talk.

812
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:18,295
He does so much to bring the others news,

813
00:49:18,996 --> 00:49:21,336
and I never thanked him properly.

814
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,674
I was so busy cooking...

815
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:27,235

I'm sure he knows how you feel.

817
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:33,945
He's like Wook.

Lee Chun Bum fled to Guam.

819
00:49:40,655 --> 00:49:43,155
Does he have family there?

820
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:48,365
No. His sister lives in Singapore.

821
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:52,365
Is the situation not looking good?

822
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:55,905
Sorry? It's not that.

823
00:49:57,876 --> 00:49:59,775
The police are looking for him.

824
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:02,376
I can't tell you when he'll be caught,

825

but we have people helping us.

Thank you.

827

Oh, right. Alice has a new friend.

828
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,515
Jjamppong, a puppy.

829
00:50:13,516 --> 00:50:14,985
She adores Jjamppong. They love to play together.

830
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:18,095
Alice loves puppies.

831
00:50:18,356 --> 00:50:20,056
And she even knows how to use the honorifics now.

832
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:22,666
I taught her, and she picked it up right away.

833
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:25,566
Thank you.

834
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:27,666
Thank you so much.

835
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:32,005
Is that Alice's favorite book?

836
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,074
We have a copy of that book in the village too.

837
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:36,045
I want to read the book to her if she likes it.

838
00:50:37,775 --> 00:50:40,845
This is my favorite book.

839
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:44,356
I used to read this to learn Korean.

840

Lee Chun Bum's sister lives in Singapore.

She's not sure about Guam.

All right. Then we should keep looking.

Hey, Il Yong. I told you that I saw that woman in my dreams.

857
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:19,545
I had another dream this morning,

858
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,485
and I saw her holding something in her hand.

859

Like what?

860
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:28,856
It kind of looked like an IV bag.

861
00:52:29,425 --> 00:52:30,456
An IV bag?

Did you just come out of there?

I was with Wook in the outside world.

Yes. This has never happened before...

except for the day when he first arrived in the village.
