1
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,687
An elderly in her 80s...

2
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:01,426
who lives alone in a shantytown of Seoul...

3
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:03,798
was found three days after her passing.

4
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:07,897
The resident of this shantytown was a basic state pension recipient...

5
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:10,638
whose one-person-household was being monitored.

6
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:13,436
But she was neglected for three weeks...

7
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:15,377
ever since her caseworker came by...

8
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,537
and soon bid her lonesome farewell to the world.

9
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,947
The government...

10
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,277
- That old lady. - What the...

11
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:22,247
The government promised its ongoing support,

12
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,317
and the municipal office suggested preventive measures...

13
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,717
Kim Gun Ju visited that old lady two years ago.

14
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:29,958
Don't you find it weird?

15
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,256
Jjonga, I have a sensitive heart.

16
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:36,628
I'd appreciate you not straining it.

17
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:39,528
Why did that make you jumpy when you even see ghosts?

18
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,537
The elderly woman had a chronic illness...

19
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:42,898
Dad, do you see ghosts?

20
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,267
What?

21
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,406
She meant that in a figurative way.

22
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,807
I should go and meet with Detective Shin.

23
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:53,307
Why don't I check security camera footage...

24
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:55,677
and see if Kim Gun Ju...

25
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:59,047
- was in the neighborhood? - I should meet with Director Choi.

26
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,387
Hold on. What's going on?

27
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:03,618
Bo Ra, why don't you and your mom get something delicious to eat?

28
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,698
Enjoy a nice meal. I'll pick you up later.

29
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:13,927
What just happened?

30
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,937
Why did they suddenly spring into action?

31
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,466
We can't do an autopsy.

32
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,808
The old woman was cremated already.

33
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,707
What if Kim Gun Ju was caught on a camera in the area?

34
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:27,717
That can't be used as evidence either.

35
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:30,248
It could be easier to just find the kids' bodies.

36
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:33,788
Kim Gun Ju hasn't moved in 30 years.

37
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,918
We could find something if we were to search her place,

38
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,957
but we can't get a search warrant on suspicion alone.

39
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:43,357
Please help me out.

40
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,196
Okay.

41
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:48,936
But you must tell me later what this is about.

42
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,167
Of course, I will.

43
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,637
Bye, then.

44
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,477
What am I looking for?

45
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:58,147
Suspicious drugs or somewhere she could hide a body.

46
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,707
Something suspicious, whatever it may be.

47
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,946
I've never been inside someone else's home.

48
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,617
We're not invading her privacy.

49
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,447
We're looking for Young Rim and Ha Yoon.

50
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:09,157
If it's about that, I'll do it a hundred times over.

51
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:12,157
Thanks. You're such a reliable ally.

52
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,226
I'll take care of things here.

53
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,497
Promise me you'll find Young Rim and Ha Yoon.

54
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,328
They've been here for too long.

55
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,238
Just them?

56
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,407

If you're in danger, talk about the weather.

- Then we'll move in. - Okay.

60
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,588
Will you be okay?

61
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,687
- What? - You don't hear me?

62
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,387
I do hear you.

63
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,697
No, I'll go instead.

64
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,696
I can say I'm taking your place.

65
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,768
No way.

66
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,837

67
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:57,838
that Kim Gun Ju might do something.

68
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,708
Ms. Lee, don't you know how great an actor I am?

69
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,338
I'm a professional.

70
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:04,338
Don't you worry.

71
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,507
Still, you should watch out.

72
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,118
Be careful.

73
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,217
Can I not hear you with this on?

74
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,717
I didn't say anything.

75
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,118
What?

76
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,778
Hello.

77
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:38,148
Director Choi told me you'd be coming.

78
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:41,777
We meet at last. I'm Jang Pan Seok.

79
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:43,447
Nice to meet you. Come in.

80
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,387
- He's inside. - Pan Seok.

81
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,828
Do you hear us?

82
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,797
Gosh, I haven't seen crocks like these in years.

83
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:59,097
I make doenjang, gochujang, and soy sauce each year.

84
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,968
I share it with others and with the welfare center.

85
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,137
Do you farm too?

86
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,107
You can't call it farming.

87
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,007
I grow just enough for myself.

88
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,607
I don't want to move a muscle when I'm at home.

89
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,076
You're quite active.

90
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:17,776
Now that I'm older, I sleep less and have more time.

91
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:18,886
Come in.

92
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:22,016
Yes, that's right. You sleep less the older you get.

93
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,587
I don't sleep much either.

94
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,327
- Come in. - Oh, sure.

My gosh, thank you.

98
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:54,617
It's schisandra berry tea.

99
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:56,618
I picked the berries and dried them myself.

100
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:59,187
Oh, my. How precious.

101
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,158
Doesn't it smell nice?

102
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,127
Well, let me see.

103
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,727
Mr. Jang, I think you should drink something else.

104
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:08,837
Oh, gosh.

105
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,637
It does smell nice but...

106
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,978
If you don't like it, shall I make you something else?

107
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,337
Yes, please.

108
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,908
I'm allergic to schisandra berries.

I see you have instant coffee mix.

110
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:27,147
I'll make it myself. You stay there.

111
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,087
That's it.

112
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,098
It's my favorite.

113

I'm sorry. Your tea's precious.

116
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,558
It's just that I much prefer this.

117
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,637
So you have some questions for me?

118
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,137
Yes.

Ha Yoon and Young Rim.

in the playground.

128
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,468
you gave them banana milk...

129
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:07,418
Banana milk...

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,757
in the playground?

131
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,408
I remember...

those kids I met in the playground.

Is the weather bad?

140
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:02,538
Mr. Jang!

141

Okay.

143
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,147
My gosh, you have so many books.

144
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,656
The other room is full too.

145
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:16,688
Yes.

146
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,357
Where are the children's books?

147
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,387
Over here.

148
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,358
Did you write all these?

149
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,998
Yes. I was paid to read and study books.

150
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:31,567
Why do you suddenly need children's books?

151
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:33,166
Is it for another book-reading?

152
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:36,578
Yes. We'll have another one for the kids.

153
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,677
Ha Yoon could barely read when she got here,

154
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:44,347
and Young Rim couldn't even write his name.

155
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:46,447
Now they're both so literate.

156
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:48,688
They improved in leaps and bounds.

157
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:54,087
These days, even Alice reads a bit.

158
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,796
She's copying the older kids,

159
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,328
so we could do an event.

160
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,126
I noticed the night we went camping...

161
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,997
that Ha Yoon taught her.

162
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:04,137
Young Rim commented on the side.

163
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,108
They both are so good with younger kids.

164
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,448
The girl is smart and the boy is kind.

165
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:17,578
They'd have become great people if they were left alive.

Mr. Jang, are you all right? Mr. Jang!

199

Are you all right?

213
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,252
Are you okay, Mr. Jang?

214
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:34,462
Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:35,892
What happened with Kim Gun Ju?

216

Gosh, you nearly gave me a heart attack.

217

You barged in yourselves to catch her?

218
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:45,543
What would you have done if something dangerous had happened?

219
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:49,173
I almost had a heart attack when I saw Mr. Jang collapsed like that.

It gave me such a scare too.

Why did you tell him?

223

Why did you have to call it in?

You're a detective. What were you doing?

I was on standby, waiting to rush to the scene.

227
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:07,563
It was all me.

228
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,531
I mean, serial murders are taking place,

229
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,161
But on the news, they said they were solitary deaths.

230
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,272
And the police didn't even know what was going on.

231
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,401
So I planned all this...

232
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:22,372
and reached out to Mr. Jang, Wook, and Detective Shin for help.

Some unexpected things happened along the way,

Doesn't it mean their bodies have been found?

No, a number of them haven't been found yet.

"I'm off. Bye, guys."

329
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:54,043
"The big blossom soaked up the sunlight..."

330
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:56,212
"and flew away in the wind."

331
00:19:57,172 --> 00:20:01,483
"It landed on a child's head."

332
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,553
When the child's dad said, "Shall I buy you ice cream?"

333
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:09,392
"The cherry blossom smiled brightly with the child."

334
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,402
Good.

335
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,072
- Eat up. - Thank you.

336
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:24,273
You did a great job.

337
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:27,172
This book-reading was very moving.

338
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:30,712
Gosh.

339
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,512
Ouch...

340
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:36,182
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

341
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:38,553
I think I overworked myself today.

342
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,152
Get some rest, Captain. We'll tidy up.

343
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:44,323
Yes, rest up.

344
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,362
Hey, push it in all the way.

345
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:52,962
Did you check the crocks?

346
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:54,361
There's nothing suspicious about them.

347
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:57,371
Don't just open them. Check what's inside by poking.

348
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:58,401
Yes, sir.

349
00:20:58,402 --> 00:20:59,843
- Open that bin and check. - Yes, sir.

350
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:03,642
What about that greenhouse?

351
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:07,543
There's nothing other than some dried herbs and cabbage.

352
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:09,382
Okay.

353
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:11,682
Hey, go inside.

354
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:17,052
Try poking it. Push it all the way in.

355
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,122
- Yes, sir. - Go inside and look around.

356
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:32,273
Why?

357
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,212
You smell something fishy, right?

358
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,442
I see.

359
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:42,112
The padlock is unusually big, isn't it?

360
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:55,662
My babies.

361
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:57,632
Goodbye.

362
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:00,402
- Bye. - Bye, Captain.

363
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:07,141
Ha Yoon, Young Rim. I'll take you home.

364
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:08,912
- Let's go. - Okay.

365
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:10,843
Bye.

366
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,152
Captain.

367
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,392
Let's dig this up.

368
00:22:58,353 --> 00:22:59,422
Goodness.

369
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,763
Ha Yoon, why do you like the cherry blossom book so much?

370
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:05,662
Because flower petals can go anywhere.

371
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,862
They can ride the wind far away.

372
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,732
I like the scab book.

373
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,773
It looks like a booger.

374
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:17,172
- Mister. - Yes?

375
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,783
When will you take us?

376
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:25,451
We had the sports day,

377
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:28,222
went camping, and had the book-reading too.

378
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,493
What do you mean?

379
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,562
Hyun Ji said so.

380
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:37,063
Once she met her dad, she would ask you to take us too.

381
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:40,533
Did she?

382
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:43,201
But he's here.

383
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:44,632
How can he take us with him?

384
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:46,843
One moment.

385
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:51,442
Here.

386
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,082
What are these photos?

387
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,053
This is a photo I took with Hyun Ji.

388
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,892
But when Hyun Ji left, she disappeared from the photo too.

389
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:15,872
Then what about this?

390
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:18,902
It's you.

391
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:24,641
- Doesn't that look good? - Yes, it does.

392
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:26,042
- It looks good. - It looks pretty.

393
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:27,782
- Can you take one of me too? - Hey, hold this.

394
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,381
- Okay. - How do I do this?

395
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:30,852
- You look in here. - Okay.

396
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:32,452
- And you push this button. - Oh, okay.

397
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,823
In 1, 2, 3.

398
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,622
- Did it turn out okay? - It's coming.

399
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,691
- One more. - One more?

400
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:44,993
- Hold that. - Okay.

401
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,042
- Here you go. - Thanks.

402
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,313
Here you go, Uncle.

403
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:01,512
- It turned out nice. - It did.

404
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:04,253
Didn't it? Ha Yoon is good at taking photos.

405
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:12,793
This is you.

406
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,691
He's here with us,

407
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:18,692
but he disappeared from the photo.

408
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:21,533
You fool. That's not how it is.

409
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,902
Mister, you're just here, right?

410
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,773
Did you come to get people?

411
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:31,972
It's okay.

412
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:34,243
I didn't tell anyone.

413
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,353
Gosh, I can't fool you.

414
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,852
You're right.

415
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:43,722
I came to keep my promise.

416
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:47,462
I promised Hyun Ji that I'd find her friends.

417
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:48,793
Really?

418
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:51,661
Mister, can we go ride the swings?

419
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:54,401
I feel so great that I want to fly through the sky.

420
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:55,932
Me too.

421
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:58,573
Okay, let's go ride the swings.

422
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,912
- Let's go. - Hey, slow down.

423
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,513
Kids, slow down.

424
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,093
Hey, where did you get that outfit?

425
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:20,322
Did you use to wear that before you died?

426
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:24,093
No, Captain Kang found it in the Room of Memories.

427
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:28,333
It's kind of old-fashioned so I had it tailored.

428
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,372
- What do you think? - It looks great on you.

429
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:38,612
Hey, it's great to see you so happy.

430
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:40,642
I'm just pretending to be.

431
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:43,353
I'm upset, but...

432
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:51,422
Anyway, you'll find my body.

433
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:54,862
I will...

434
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:57,162
find you no matter what.

435
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:04,833
Captain Kang's leg seemed to be bothering her.

436
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,701
It should get better soon, right?

437
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,872
Don't you get better quickly when you get hurt here?

438
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:10,442
Well, yes.

439
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:14,912
But she says her leg hurts around the time of her death anniversary.

440
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,583
- On her death anniversary? - Yes.

441
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:20,722
But she gets better on the next day.

442
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,053
I see.

443
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,993
She even holds rites for her late husband and son here.

444
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:30,932
But I guess no one remembers her death anniversary.

445
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:33,661
She doesn't have any living family members,

446
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:35,661
but one of the crew she used to sail with...

447
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:38,003
does hold rites for her every year.

448
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:40,342
For Captain Kang, her husband,

449
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,773
and even her son too.

450
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,513
Is that so?

451
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:42,972
There's one here too.

452
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,172
Hey!

453
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:54,243
Call CSI!

454
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:02,452
I am an airplane flying through the sky!

455
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:05,961
I'm a flower petal riding the wind through the sky!

456
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:08,691
Goodness, hold on tight. You might fall off!

457
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:10,593
Okay!

458
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:17,172
Ha Yoon, why do you like the cherry blossom book so much?

459
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:21,172
Because flower petals can go anywhere.

460
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,773
They can ride the wind far away.

461
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:30,813
I like the scab book.

462
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,483
It looks like a booger.

463
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,192
If it weren't for me,

464
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,702
they'd still be in pain.

465
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:56,932
I...

466
00:30:57,872 --> 00:30:59,172
saved...

467
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:02,642
those people.

468
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:13,381
A serial killer who had murdered dozens of people...

469
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:16,022
over the course of 23 years has been arrested by the police.

470
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:18,352
The culprit was a woman in her 50s by the name of Kim Gun Ju...

471
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:22,563
who has been targeting children and the elderly.

472
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:25,333
(Choi Ha Yoon, Lee Young Rim)

473
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:42,083
(Lee Young Rim)

474
00:31:51,023 --> 00:31:55,093
Young Rim, Ha Yoon, goodbye.

475
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,493
Reunite with my Hyun Ji...

476
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:01,003
and have fun together, okay?

477
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,003
When you meet her,

478
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,503
tell her that her dad is fine.

479
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:09,303
Tell Hyun Ji...

480
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:12,743
not to worry about her dad.

481
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,843
We're here for him.

482
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,013
And Hyun Ji...

483
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,422
has good friends.

484
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,122
Don't worry.

485
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:28,862
Right.

486
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,192
I won't worry.

487
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:36,932
Take care.

488
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:51,813
Hyun Ji kept her promise.

489
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:56,553
She told them that her dad would come for her...

490
00:32:58,093 --> 00:33:00,862
and that he'd find all her friends as well.

491
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:05,793
She told everyone that it'd happen.

492
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:09,232
Then, her father came...

(Day 10,911)

494
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,603
He found the bodies of Young Rim and Ha Yoon as well.

495
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,371
- Captain Kang. - Yes?

496
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,073
- Are you in there? - Coming!

497
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:29,952
Gosh.

498
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:42,631
For 30 years after coming to this village,

499
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:45,802
I felt trapped in all directions.

500
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:48,772
But then Il Yong came three years ago,

501
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:52,242
and he's been updating me about the outside world.

502
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,483
And recently,

503
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:59,113
from Eun Hee to Ha Yoon and Young Rim,

504
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:01,753
we were able to send them off.

505
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:04,853
It's a good thing...

506
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:07,563
that the children left.

507
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,322
Gosh.

508
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,863
So much has changed.

509
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:13,802
That's what I see.

510
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:17,173
A lot has changed out there and in here as well.

511
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:22,872
That...

512
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:25,412
has me scared.

513
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:28,642
How so?

514
00:34:29,182 --> 00:34:31,282
Are you worried about Wook finding your body...

515
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:33,653
and your wife losing her pension?

516
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:40,863
What has gotten into you today? This isn't like you.

517
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,792
The blood on the books and now this.

518
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,992
That's not it!

519
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:53,142
I'm sorry.

520
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:58,713
It was me I was angry at, not you.

521

I don't know what this is about,

522

but don't talk if you don't want to.

523
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,753
Some secrets are taken to the grave,

524
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:15,693
but we're not even lying in them yet.

You see,

526
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,372
my son...

527

isn't in the States.

Everything went as planned.

Trust is key when it comes to business.

Our clients will go crazy if we don't deliver as promised.

You know how sensitive our clients are.

How will it be delivered?

All 20 men are hometown friends of mine,

so you don't have to worry.

That Oh Il Yong you mentioned.

546

I'm also looking for him.

Okay, I'll put my trust in you.

What happened a few days ago should be a one-time event.

549

Do you know how much of my merchandise the police took?

550
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,077
It was worth 30 million dollars on the market.

551
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:54,048
The thought of that has me furious even in my sleep.

552

Keep up the good work.

Hi, doctor.

Captain.

558
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:19,847
Hi.

559
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,347
His car took a tumble in the woods.

560
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,287
A hiker reported it.

561
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:32,317
There was no ID on him,

562
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,826
his prints had been burned off,

563
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:37,158
and the car was unregistered which is why it took so long.

564
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:40,667
There were also drugs in the car.

565
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:42,597
He had consumed a lethal dosage.

566
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:45,368
What?

567
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:47,338
Goliath on drugs?

568
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,108
According to the tox screen, yes.

569
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:53,508
He didn't even allow his goons to take drugs.

570
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:56,977
The overdose is part of a cover-up. He was probably murdered.

571
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,448
Right?

572
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,787
How did you know to come here though?

573
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:06,827
I made a lot of calls while trying to look for Detective Ko.

574
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:10,057
I asked them to call me...

575
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:11,997
if a John Doe surfaced.

I see.

If Goliath is back operating on the dark web,

578
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:21,307
then Kim Pil Joong was killed to cut loose ends.

It's an ongoing investigation, so you know the drill.

You led us to Detective Ko as well, so you've done enough.

I was wondering if he was connected to another missing persons case.

Why'd you end up here if you slipped?

Don't get too upset.

727

It was my fault. I slipped and hurt myself.

728
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:32,777
Why would you cover for a son like that?

729
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:35,388
He must've freaked out.

730

He couldn't have known what to do.

It's always the parents' fault.

820
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:25,278
You mean, over there by that tree?

821
00:54:27,037 --> 00:54:28,448
I guess you can't see it.

822
00:54:29,077 --> 00:54:31,317
Shouldn't it be consistent?

823
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:34,246
Either let me see everything or nothing at all.

824
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:36,687
I can only see some things.

825
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:40,786
Where are your earphones?

826
00:54:40,787 --> 00:54:41,827
Why?

827
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,508
Oh, yes.

828
00:54:57,778 --> 00:54:59,377
I swear, that place really exists.

829
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:03,247
Yes, I believe you.

830
00:55:05,017 --> 00:55:06,477
Although I can't see it.

831
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:11,218
How come you're different from the other dead people?

832
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:18,897
I'm curious about that too.

833
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:23,868
Why am I different from the others?

834
00:55:26,968 --> 00:55:27,968
Then...

835
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:31,338
let's find out why.

836
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:40,048
Aren't you going home?

837
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:41,948
I should.

838
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:44,717
Hey, do you want to grab a drink with me?

839
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:47,318
There's a new pork belly restaurant in Jogi-dong.

840
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:48,588
What's gotten into you?

841
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:51,227
Sure, let's take my car. Pay me for driving you home.

842
00:55:52,028 --> 00:55:54,127
Goodness. Hold on.

843
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:56,868
I turned down the interview request, but they keep calling.

844
00:55:57,327 --> 00:55:59,397
- Hey, Reporter Choi. - I'll go bring the car around.

845
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:02,508
Can't you just email me the interview questions?

846
00:56:04,638 --> 00:56:05,678
Bo Ra.

847
00:56:25,557 --> 00:56:26,658
Do you know me?

848
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:28,068
Of course, I know you.

849
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,167
Who are you, mister?

850
00:56:33,238 --> 00:56:34,307
Me?

851
00:56:35,207 --> 00:56:36,408
I'm...

852
00:56:38,238 --> 00:56:39,807
Let's just say I'm your dad's friend.

853
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:41,877
Okay, so?

854
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:44,247
What do you mean, so?

855
00:56:52,758 --> 00:56:54,488
Take your friends out for a nice dinner.

856
00:56:57,187 --> 00:56:58,456
No, it's okay.

857
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,358
You can accept what adults give you as a gift.

858
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:03,167
Take it.

859
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,306
What?

860
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,048
Look at him slacking off.

861
00:57:19,718 --> 00:57:21,317
(Police)

862
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:23,787
He hasn't even started the car yet. What is he doing?

863
00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:27,556
Hey, Detective Shin!

864
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:29,258
Detective Shin! Jun Ho!

865
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,056
Hey, Jun Ho! My goodness.

866
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:33,928
Hey, hang in there.

867
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:36,567
Hello? Anybody there?

868
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:39,068
Someone's been stabbed... Darn it.

869
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:42,368
Hello? 911?

870
00:57:42,638 --> 00:57:44,537
Someone's been stabbed.

871
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:48,077
Come to the parking lot at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Hurry.

872
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:55,247
I guess no one's home yet.

873
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:56,948
Shall I go inside?

874
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,957
You said you'd never enter strangers' homes.

875
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:05,457
This isn't considered invasion of privacy.

876
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:08,698
Our lives depend on this.

877
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:13,667
Okay.

878
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:17,778
Tell me if you see anything suspicious, whatever it is.

879
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:20,508
From the wallpaper patterns to the light bulbs, check everything.

880
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:22,807
Will do.

881
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:33,618
What's wrong?

882
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:35,928
Hold on.

883
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:54,977
I can't do it.

884
00:59:00,977 --> 00:59:03,618
I can't enter this house.

885
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:35,118
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

886
00:59:35,347 --> 00:59:38,687
This is the only house on this street with a home security system.

887
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:41,727
There's something in that house.

888
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:43,027
Do you recognize this face?

889
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:44,258
I don't know who he is.

890
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,657
If the job pays well... Of course, I'll do it.

891
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:50,868
Stabbing a cop at a police station is a piece of cake to them.

892
00:59:51,238 --> 00:59:52,737
Mr. Kim Wook, you be careful too.

893
00:59:52,738 --> 00:59:54,037
You'll report him missing?

894
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:55,707
Did something happen to Mr. Kim?

895
00:59:55,937 --> 00:59:57,207
I want to know...

896
00:59:57,568 --> 00:59:59,707
why I'm different from the other dead people.

897
00:59:59,977 --> 01:00:02,178
Il Yong, hang in there.
