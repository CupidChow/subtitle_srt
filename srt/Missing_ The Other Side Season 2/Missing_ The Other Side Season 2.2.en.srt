00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,198
I don't think so.

170
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,267
Hey, Mister.

171
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:41,808
- Aren't you Hyun Ji's dad? - What?

172
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:52,848
Do you know Hyun Ji?

173
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:58,887
Why aren't you guys coming?

174
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:02,598
We'll be right there.

175
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,968
Pan Seok. Pull yourself together.

176
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,098
- What? - Don't you know where we are?

177
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:14,267
Right.

178
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:19,708
Right.

179
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,188
- What are you doing? - What?

180
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,948
I was just looking.

181
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,718
It's been a while since they left.

182
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:32,228
(Supermarket, Post Box)

183
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:34,458
They probably met Eun Hee by now.

184
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,958
I wonder if Ha Yoon recognized him.

185
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,328
If she did, she would mention Hyun Ji.

186
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,568
- Here you go. - Thank you.

187
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:45,907
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

188
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,167
- Thank you. - Thank you.

189
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,167
You're welcome.

190
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,078
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

191
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,738
Let's trade.

192
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:52,877
- Okay. - Right.

193
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,478
I don't see Ha Yoon or Young Rim.

194
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:56,578
- Thank you. - Ro Ha, did you see them?

195
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,917
They were talking to that man.

196
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,657
Right. Pan Seok said his stomach hurt,

197
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,688
so the kids took him to the bathroom.

198
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:07,828
I see.

199
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:14,167
You said your name was Kim Wook. Right?

200
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:16,137
I'm not just Wook.

201
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,897
It's bright as the sun, Wook.

202
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,767
My mom named me that so that I'd become a person...

203
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,137
who will brighten the world.

204
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,147
Most people are awkward and anxious when they first come here,

205
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,117
but you're not like that.

206
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:30,578
You're good with the kids too.

207
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,988
I tend to adjust well to anywhere I go.

208
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,417
I like kids too.

209
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,257
But... Eun Hee, was it?

210
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,688
- Yes? - Ms. Eun Hee,

211
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:43,458
when did you first come here?

212
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:46,297
Twenty years ago.

213
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,527
I'm older than you.

214
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:51,698
Right.

215
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:58,747
So...

216
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,777
how did you know I was Hyun Ji's dad?

217
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:04,417
I saw you in a photo that Hyun Ji had.

218
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:06,818
So Hyun Ji...

219
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,387
was here with you guys?

220
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,027
Yes. She and I were good friends.

221
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:16,257
But Hyun Ji isn't here anymore.

222
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:19,497
We were drawing by the lake a while back,

223
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,698
and she suddenly disappeared.

224
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:22,838
You silly.

225
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,637
She didn't just disappear. She left.

226
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:26,667
My gosh.

227
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:29,407
Did you take Hyun Ji with you?

228
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:33,308
You dummy. It's not that...

229
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,948
- Come here. - What?

230
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:39,318
So Hyun Ji was here with such good friends?

231
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,787
Thank you.

232
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:43,858
Hey kids.

233
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,127
If you don't go right now, you won't get any rice balls.

234
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,188
Right.

235
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:51,358
Go and have some snacks.

236
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,527
- Okay. - Okay.

237
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,978
They said Hyun Ji was here.

238
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:36,037
(Supermarket)

239
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:47,348
You're Wook,

240
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,988
and you're Hyun Ji's dad. Right?

241
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,688
Wait, how did you know I was Hyun Ji's dad?

242
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,188
Il Yong told me.

243
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,027
Hyun Ji used to brag about her dad so much.

244
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:59,127
The people here might not know your face,

245
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,367
but they all know who you are.

246
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:03,938
I see.

247
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,068
Please, eat up.

248
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:09,838
If you don't finish this today, you won't be able to leave.

249
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,108
I...

250
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,007
haven't digested the rice balls I ate earlier yet.

251
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,948
My gosh. That was nothing. One burp and it'll go right down.

252
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:21,448
Here. Try this.

253
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,358
It's fine. I'll feed you.

254
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:25,588
Here.

255
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,558
What is this?

256
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:31,997
It's so good. You should try some too.

257
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:35,468
- Thank you. I'll enjoy it. - Okay.

258
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:44,308
Whenever someone new comes to this village,

259
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:48,917
they all come from that tree like that little girl.

260
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,917
But I didn't see the two of you come in.

261
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,647
That means that you took a different path.

262
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,058
For example, you came from the outside.

263
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,797
Captain Kang knows everything.

264
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,838
I'm pretty powerful here, you see.

265
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,308
Everyone knows who Captain Kang is.

266
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:14,637
There's not a single person here who hasn't had my food,

267
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,037
and none of them ever said it tasted bad.

268
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:20,608
But it's the first time I'm cooking for living people.

269
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,647
How is it? Does it taste good?

270
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:26,517
Yes. It's really good.

271
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:27,917
Right?

272
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,387
I want to take this outside and sell it.

273
00:17:31,387 --> 00:17:33,058
Thank you for the food.

274
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,928
By the way, Hyun Ji takes after her mom, not her dad.

275
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,328
Yes. Thank goodness for that.

276
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:43,138
I have been wanting to say that...

277
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:44,837
- My gosh. - What did you want to say?

278
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,607
My daughter should take after me,

279
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,238
but your daughter should take after her mom.

280
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:52,077
Fine. You should have a daughter who takes after you...

281
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:54,408
and suffer the consequences of that.

282
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,347
Why are you getting mad about that?

283
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:59,888
You there don't have a girlfriend or a wife.

284
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:01,618
"You there?"

285
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,158
I'm older than you.

286
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,428
Shouldn't you go home?

287
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:09,898
I work here.

288
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,097
Drop by every now and then.

289
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:13,497
I'm stuck here,

290
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,638
but I can always cook for you.

291
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,007
- Okay? - Yes.

292
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,668
Go on.

293
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:24,777
So...

294
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,777
- Thank you. - Get back safely.

295
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:32,888
Is it this way?

296
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,287
- He'll feel confused. - Let's go inside.

297
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:39,128
Captain Kang. Doesn't she remind you of Thomas?

298
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:42,128
She handles all the village's affairs.

299
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:43,827
When Alice arrived,

300
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:47,168
none of us noticed, but she rushed over.

301
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:51,168
Then the tree split and Alice appeared.

302
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:55,468
There must be this kind of feeling.

303
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,478
Why are you standing there?

304
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,557
Wook.

305
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,458
What is it?

306
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:21,868
I can't leave.

307
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,468
Because of Hyun Ji?

308
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,738
Yes.

309
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:37,878
I'll go on my own, then.

310
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,037
I think this is it.

311
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,037
This is Bo Ra's mom's friend's business?

312
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:04,238
Hello.

313
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,277
I'm Detective Shin Jun Ho from the Missing Persons Squad.

314
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,047
What's a policeman doing here?

315
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:12,148
I have a few questions about Moon Se Young.

316
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,847
Did something happen to her?

317
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:17,287
She hasn't been picking up or reading my texts.

318
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,357
It's been a week, I guess?

319
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:21,527
Did you check out where she works?

320
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:23,458
Where is that?

321
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:26,968
Welcome.

322
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,337
Someone called for a driver?

323
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:33,337
A driver?

324
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:35,507
Come on.

325
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:37,978
Do I look like I wouldn't hang out here for fun?

326
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,378
Here.

327
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:41,978
I'm an officer.

328
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:45,118
Did Moon Se Young come to work today?

329
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,547
Why are you looking for her?

330
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:48,888
Is something wrong?

331
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:51,017
She was reported missing.

332
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,027
She hasn't been home in days and she can't be reached.

333
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:55,287
She's missing?

334
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,597
Se Young's on holiday.

335
00:20:58,198 --> 00:20:59,228
A holiday?

336
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:01,398
Yes. She said she'd miss work for a while.

337
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,968
Did you notice anything unusual?

338
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,368
No.

339
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:09,178
There was a drunk troublemaker that day.

340
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:12,478
It was Se Young's room and she had a rough time.

341
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:14,678
Other than that, nothing happened.

342
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:15,918
It was rough?

343
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,478
Did the guy assault her or something?

344
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:20,488
He was so drunk he could barely sit up.

345
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:22,517
Se Young had a rough time cleaning up his puke.

346
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,257
Can I see your security footage?

347
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:26,488
The security footage?

348
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:27,888
You can see it from here.

349
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:32,297
It doesn't look like she's rushed...

350
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:34,628
or being chased.

351
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:38,337
Can you make me a copy?

352
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,708
Sure.

353
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,878
Oh, gosh. Goodness.

354
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:47,178
The floor's hot.

355
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,118
It's because I cooked some scorched rice.

356
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:54,488
The main house has a modern boiler,

357
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,357
but this room has an old-style stone floor.

358
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:06,628
(Let's eat.)

359
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,968
(Mom, I miss you.)

360
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:11,267
(Jin Ah, don't cry.)

361
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,307
I have no idea who did this.

362
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:16,307
I lose count of the kids that come by.

363
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:17,908
They scribble all the time.

364
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,077
Where did my Hyun Ji stay?

365
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:28,118
She stayed at the dorm with Eun Hee.

366
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:31,017
Eun Hee's great with the kids.

367
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:33,188
Right.

368
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:34,827
If you need water...

369
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:36,827
No, it's fine.

370
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,728
Silly me. I overstayed my welcome.

371
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:43,297
- I'll let you rest, then. - Okay.

372
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,537
- Thank you. - Not at all.

373
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,648
Goodness.

374
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:03,958
Ms. Kim.

375
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,757
(Let's eat. Mom, I miss you. Jin Ah, don't cry.)

376
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:09,428
Eun Hee's here.

377
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:14,428
Eun Hee...

378
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:19,807
looked after my Hyun Ji.

379
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:41,327
The darn deities people are on about.

380
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,728
They could've let him come by and see Hyun Ji before she left.

381
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,416
A woman in her 20s was found dead in a wedding dress,

382
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,186
and police are investigating.

383
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:14,156
Reporter Myung Min Joon has the story.

384
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:17,395
At around one this afternoon, on a beach in Cheonan,

385
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,426
- a body was found... - Why are you in the dark?

386
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:20,526
Aren't you scared?

387
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,026
Police got involved.

388
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:25,266
The woman was found in a wedding dress.

389
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:26,706
- Jong A. - Police identified her...

390
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,635
as Choi Jung A who was reported missing...

391
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,105
- two days ago. - Do you not feel well?

392
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:33,006
Wook. I went to school with her.

393
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,246
She'd been missing since her sudden disappearance...

394
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:38,315
Hey. That woman was your friend?

395
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,815
Yes. We went to high school together.

396
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,656
We didn't stay in touch,

397
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:46,855
but I heard the news when I saw my friends two days ago.

398
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:48,686
She ran off during her wedding.

399
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,996
But she was found dead.

400
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:54,095
She ran off?

401
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,696
He said she was abducted.

402
00:24:58,436 --> 00:24:59,466
Abducted?

403
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:02,565
Jung A was abducted?

404
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:06,605
How do you know her?

405
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,115
Well, I don't know her personally.

406
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:20,555
Okay, so the dead guy who came to see you...

407
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:22,526
witnessed Jung A's abduction.

408
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:25,426
He took you to an industrial complex saying he knows...

409
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,996
where the daughter of the cafe voice phishing victim is,

410
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:31,035
and there, you found another place like Duon Village?

411
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,236
And that turned out to be where Hyun Ji was?

412
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:37,035
Yes, that's right.

413
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:41,605
So, that Oh Il Yong.

414
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:44,716
How did he know to find you?

415
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,785
We met by chance in the cafe.

416
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:49,345
I didn't imagine he was dead.

417
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,055
I bet he was shocked too.

418
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:54,085
He must've found it fascinating that he could talk to me,

419
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:56,555
and so he came back?

420
00:25:57,226 --> 00:26:00,595
Do you think it was pure coincidence that you met?

421
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,535
Is this another conspiracy theory?

422
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:14,666
I'm sorry.

423
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,686
Sorry I came too late.

424
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:04,716
Mom!

425
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,085
Alice, what's wrong?

426
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,486
Why are you crying?

427
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,656
Please don't cry.

428
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,656
It's all right.

429
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,565
Is it because you miss your mom?

430
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,805
I miss my mom too.

431
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:28,045
But I'm trying to be a big girl and not cry.

432
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,355
Ms. Eun Hee.

433
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,825
Alice, why are you crying?

434
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:44,355
Let's grab our meal...

435
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,196
and have some fun at the school playground.

436
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,815
Hold on. Is it her you're fond of...

437
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:05,315
or do you like going to the playground?

438
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,986
Ha Yoon, is it a special day today?

439
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:13,486
You put that headband on only on special days.

440
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,156
I wanted to show it to Hyun Ji's dad.

441
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:17,795
Hyun Ji's dad?

442
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:19,966
And where exactly is he?

443
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:22,266
He was at the school yesterday.

444
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,545
So this is where you were.

445
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,085
I looked for you everywhere, Mr. Jang.

446
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:43,716
Gosh.

447
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:47,085
I take it that I'm a well-known figure here.

448
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:50,196
Hyun Ji bragged about you a lot.

449
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,966
She told us about the books you read to her,

450
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:55,926
the headband you bought her,

451
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,166
and the trips you went on with her.

452
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:02,365
I'm glad to know...

453
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:05,476
she had many good memories.

454
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:06,946
Don't even get me started.

455
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:09,645
Some people here might even choose you...

456
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,875
when asked about the one they wish to see the most.

457
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,156
Gosh, I'm only joking.

458
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,186
I heard that you took great care of her...

459
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,726
while she was here.

460
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,196
- Thank you. - Please don't mention it.

461
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,895
I'm the one who received more help from her.

462
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:32,595
She was a good friend to everyone...

463
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:34,805
and was as kind as a beautiful angel.

464
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:39,075
When Hyun Ji left us two years ago,

465
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,206
we assumed she had been found by her father.

466
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,045
How did you end up here though?

467
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:52,615
Please don't worry about me since I'm doing just fine.

468
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:58,426
How long have you been here?

469
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,926
For 20 years.

470
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,325
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

471
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:05,635
I look exactly the same, but my mom would've aged a lot.

472
00:31:08,006 --> 00:31:10,035
When Hyun Ji talked about her father,

473
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,176
I was reminded of my mother a lot.

474
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:16,446
In her eyes, I was always the prettiest and smartest.

475
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:19,246
She announced to all our neighbors that I got into med school...

476
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:21,315
and called me a doctor.

477
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,716
It was so embarrassing.

478
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,855
Of course she did. She had every right to brag.

479
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:30,026
Right? She had every right.

480
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,095
I am nothing but grateful.

481
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:39,906
I haven't made new memories for 20 years,

482
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,135
but all the memories I recall have been pleasant...

483
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:45,075
and they were of me being loved.

484
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:51,615
It must be why Hyun Ji was always cheerful.

485
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,156
Thank you.

486
00:31:58,555 --> 00:31:59,615
Thank you so much.

487
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:05,996
No.

488
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:08,726
Take me with you. Come on.

489
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,166
I'm coming with.

490
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,266
Pan Seok will soon come by with him.

491
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,805
It's not a place you should visit.

492
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,605
It's where Hyun Ji was.

493
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:18,176
- She's practically family. - You won't see a thing though.

494
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,845

00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,475
You agreed not to either.

658
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:43,346
You too, Jjonga.

659
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:45,776
You made such a fuss saying we were late on rent.

660
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:48,515
Looking for dead people costs time and money.

661
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:49,585
Right? I won't.

662
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:52,786
When did I ever make a fuss?

663
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,886
Plus, there are exceptions when it comes to helping people.

664
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:59,725
I'll pay more for my part of the rent or something.

665
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,625
Okay. You can't go back on your word then.

666
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,625
What?

667
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,495
I'll go meet Yang Eun Hee tomorrow.

668
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:08,406
Okay.

669
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:11,105
Baby.

670
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:14,176
Can you eat a bite of this?

671
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:22,745
Alice, were you eating?

672
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:25,116
Hey. Come have a seat.

673
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,156
I'll make some fried eggs.

674
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:30,256
- Okay. - The kid won't eat.

675
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:34,165
Goodness.

676
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,265
Alice, did you eat a lot?

677
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:39,935
What? You didn't eat anything.

678
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,145
Meow.

679
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:51,616
Meow.

680
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:53,745
Meow.

681
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,886
Meow.

682
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:00,315
Meow.

683
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:03,585
- Meow. - Meow.

684
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,326
Let's have some rice too.

685
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:09,725
Meow.

686
00:42:12,536 --> 00:42:13,596
That's good.

687
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:16,906
Baby. Do you want some fried eggs too?

688
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,875
This too. Good girl.

689
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:22,946
Fried eggs. This is my favorite.

690
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,145
I'm going to eat this.

691
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:28,716
I want it.

692
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:31,515
Meow.

693
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,326
She's quite the picky customer.

694
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,026
My gosh. You're quite skilled.

695
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:39,026
What do you mean?

696
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,696
A cute kitten is eating right now.

697
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,806
Oh, right. Where's Yang Eun Hee's house?

698
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,306
The school's residence.

699
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:50,736
- The residence? - Yes.

700
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,335
I was going to take Alice there after she finished eating.

701
00:42:53,506 --> 00:42:55,545
It's fine. I'll take her.

702
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:57,846
Have some soup.

703
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:04,915
She's sleeping deeply.

704
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:08,225
It seems Alice is really comfortable around me.

705
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,056
I picked her up because her legs hurt, and she fell right asleep.

706
00:43:13,866 --> 00:43:15,026
Can I take a look around your place?

707
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,395
Of course. Take your time.

708
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:01,045
On September 3, 2002, Yang Eun Hee disappeared.

709
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:03,006
At first, it was reported that she ran away.

710
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:05,676
Then a week later, they began a missing person investigation.

711
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,786
Gosh, a million things could happen in a week.

712
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:11,455
Gosh. Don't get mad and listen.

713
00:44:11,455 --> 00:44:13,216
You've got such a temper.

714
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:15,625
That's right. It's not Detective Shin's fault.

715
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:18,895
Back then, you needed circumstantial evidence to start a case.

716
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:22,265
On top of that, Yang Eun Hee disappeared into thin air.

717
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:25,495
All of her things were still at home.

718
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,065
What about her phone? Where's her cellphone?

719
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:30,975
They never found her cellphone.

720
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:33,975
Then who was the last person Eun Hee was with?

721
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:36,946
I got into a fight with my boyfriend,

722
00:44:36,946 --> 00:44:39,315
and I stayed at the library alone until late.

723
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,585
Then Jung Sik took me home.

724
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:44,386
I came to the front of my house safely...

725
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:51,225
Thank you, Jung Sik.

726
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:54,065
Get home safe.

727
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:57,736
Hold on.

728
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:01,765
I have something to tell you.

729
00:45:04,906 --> 00:45:06,806
I really like you.

730
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:11,875
I really like you.

731
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,375
Why are you doing this?

732
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:17,386
I'll treat you a lot better than Young Jun.

733
00:45:17,786 --> 00:45:19,656
I really like you.

734
00:45:19,656 --> 00:45:21,326
I like you so much.

735
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,526
Stop it!

736
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:35,165
Eun Hee.

737
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,846
Wake up.

738
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:53,156
That's the last thing I remember.

739
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:56,125
Then Cho Jung Sik or whatever...

740
00:45:57,026 --> 00:45:58,855
was the culprit?

741
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:01,225
Cho Jung Sik was the last witness.

742
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:04,136
Someone saw the two of them leave the library.

743
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:07,065
Cho Jung Sik testified that he brought Yang Eun Hee home...

744
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,935
and left right afterward.

745
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:12,435
But the police investigated him as a prime suspect.

746
00:46:12,435 --> 00:46:14,076
Then soon after Cho Jung Sik...

747
00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:16,745
wrote a letter saying he was sorry to Yang Eun Hee...

748
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:18,276
and committed suicide.

749
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,886
According to Eun Hee's mom, Cho Jung Sik called her...

750
00:46:21,886 --> 00:46:23,015
before he committed suicide.

751
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:25,286
He said that Park Young Jun would know where Eun Hee was.

752
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:29,656
Park Young Jun said that he got into a fight with Yang Eun Hee,

753
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:32,855
came home early, took some cold medicine, and went to bed.

754
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:34,866
His parents confirmed his alibi,

755
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:37,636
and three months later, he went to study abroad.

756
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:41,506
Park Young Jun is the culprit.

757
00:46:43,265 --> 00:46:45,676
Is that what Yang Eun Hee said? That he killed her?

758
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:48,006
No, it's not that.

759
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:49,975
I saw a cellphone at Yang Eun Hee's house.

760
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:51,375

You dirty wench. And with Jung Sik of all people.

764
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:05,596
Park Young Jun was watching...

765
00:47:05,596 --> 00:47:08,096
Cho Jung Sik and Yang Eun Hee from there.

766
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:11,665
I saw the text Young Jun sent when I got here.

767
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:15,435
I think he got the wrong idea when he saw me with Jung Sik.

768
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:18,676
Young Jun usually gets pretty jealous.

769
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:20,105
Then...

770
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:23,276
he could've seen you collapse.

771
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:26,045
I don't know that. He could've left before then.

772
00:47:26,045 --> 00:47:28,685
You don't know that. He could've stayed and watched.

773

Come on. That would be weird.

774
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:34,426
The fact that I'm here means someone hid my body.

775
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:37,286
Young Jun saw me collapse...

776
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,426
but didn't call for help?

777
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:41,225
Because he killed you.

778
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:43,526
That's why he didn't call for help.

779
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,475
If we have that text, it could serve as evidence.

780
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:54,446
We didn't find anything on Park Young Jun's phone.

781
00:47:54,446 --> 00:47:55,605
I'm sure he deleted them.

782
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:57,815
Back then, there was no such thing as digital forensics,

783

and phone companies didn't hold onto data for as long.

Gosh, Eun Hee's mom didn't even know that.

She was still paying for Eun Hee's phone bill.

How long does it take you to get to downtown Hyunseong?

Here, this is your land on this mountain, right?

So what you mean is they're building a road...

But you loved Eun Hee so much...

and didn't give up on her until the end.

Eun Hee probably knows how you feel too.

I think that's why Hyun Ji was also bright and cheerful too.

01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:21,606
And my Hyun Ji was probably the same.

At least Hyun Ji had returned like that.
