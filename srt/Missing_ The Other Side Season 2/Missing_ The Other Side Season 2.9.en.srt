00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,496
You'd better answer my question honestly.

5
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,050
You two.

6
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:03,050
You aren't dead, right?

7
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,011
Il Yong is dead.

8
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,980
Like you.

9
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,611
And...

10
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,181
I'm...

11
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,280
Wook, wait.

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,350
I'm not dead.

13
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:43,261
I'm very much alive.

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,661
What?

15
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,881
What did you just say?

16
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,651
You're not dead?

17
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,420
You're alive?

18
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,530
Yes.

19
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,491
Are you...

20
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,901
really alive?

21
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,570
How?

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,940
Lead the way.

23
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,850
- Where? - Where you just came from...

24
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,220
- so that I can leave as well. - I'm afraid you can't.

25
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:21,790
You said you already attempted to leave.

26
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,260
Which is why you should lead the way!

27
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,560
What I mean is that...

28
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,701
you two can take me with you.

29
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,771
Detective Ko, that's not how it works.

30
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,340
Who knows?

31
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:48,151
This also has me intrigued.

32
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,090
Wook just confirmed that he is alive.

33
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,391
Lower that gun, will you?

34
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,701
Every one of us here is dead, but not Wook!

35
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,931
But that's no reason to shoot a man.

36
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:07,901
He has been lying to us this whole time.

37
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,901
It's not like we made it our mission to lie.

38
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,040
Say something, will you?

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,280
Right. I'm sure there's a reason he kept quiet.

40
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,010
Lead the way, then.

41
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,260
I'm curious, that's all.

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,201
Come on.

43
00:04:58,621 --> 00:04:59,690
Gosh.

44
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,591
- We should get to them. - Sure.

45
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,531
What?

46
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:09,330
- I know where they'll show up. - What?

47
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,400
But...

48
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,250
Where did the two of them go?

49
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:30,281
They'll probably be in front of the supermarket.

50
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,731
We should get back.

51
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,101
I already told you this.

52
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:47,770
There's no way for us to leave this village.

53
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,871
How does that make any sense?

54
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,700
How could you all...

55
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,171
not be fazed by this?

56
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,481
Nothing's going on here. As you were, guys.

57
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,981
I also agree that this makes no sense,

58
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,421
so I can imagine your frustration.

59
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,161
Wook's right.

60
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,221
It's not because we're unfazed by this.

61
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:12,690
There's just nothing we can do about it...

62
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,361
whether he's alive or not.

63
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,371
Follow me unless you want the whole village to know.

64
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,801
Detective Ko, you too.

65
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,471
You should wait out here.

66
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,650
Rather than getting worked up over this,

67
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,320
follow us inside and hear us out.

68
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,950
Don't touch me.

69
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,361
So here's what happened in a nutshell.

70
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:46,591
Il Yong went to see Eun Hee's mom...

71
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,361
and ran into Wook for the first time.

72
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,200
Fascinated by the fact that a living person could see him,

73
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,841
Il Yong brought him to the village.

74
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:58,570
From Eun Hee, Seung Jae, to Ro Ha, Wook has been locating...

75
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,341
the dead bodies of the village people.

76
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:02,810
Is that it?

77
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,541
Yes.

78
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:07,911
It was all Wook though.

79
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,520
There's not much I can do among the living.

80
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,750
Il Yong's been feeding me a lot of information.

81
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,890
That helped immensely.

82
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,361
The living and the dead have been working together.

83
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,361
Leave them be.

84
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,471
It's spilled milk in there. Besides, I'm the more urgent issue.

85
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,070
How so?

86
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,541
I'm being gnawed by guilt.

87
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,541
Wook's secret is out,

88
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,371
so maybe I should come clean as well.

89
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,111
I don't think that's a good idea.

90
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,411
What?

91
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:41,351
Wook doesn't have a connection with this village,

92
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,921
but people will think that you can see us...

93
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,250
because you're Hyun Ji's father.

94
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
They'll keep pestering you to bring their loved ones here as well.

95
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,890
You couldn't possibly handle that, so stay put.

96
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,361
It doesn't sit right with me to feign ignorance.

97
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Detective Ko, thanks to you,

98
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,871
we were able to arrest Goliath's gang.

99
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,111
Goliath went into hiding,

100
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
but he'll soon be found now that the police are looking.

101
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,851
Did they get Gwang Taek too?

102
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,510
He's the one who killed me.

103
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,580
I know, and I informed the police.

104
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,421
I made sure they received the evidence you told me about.

105
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,390
The one who killed you went to prison on a drug charge,

106
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,260
but he hasn't confessed to murder yet.

107
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,760
Detectives are still searching for evidence.

108
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,700
What about Captain Lee?

109
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,371
Does he know I'm here?

110
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,510
He wouldn't believe me even if I told him.

111
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,510
The village isn't visible to them.

112
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,440
Give it a try though. You can see us, can't you?

113
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,411
There may be others.

114
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,580
I've already tried that.

115
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:50,020
I said I could see dead people...

116
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:53,121
and that got me treated as a lunatic.

117
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,921
People look at him funny...

118
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,791
when he's out there with me.

119
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,890
Because to them,

120
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,960
it's like he's talking to himself.

121
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:07,101
And Captain Kang knew about everything?

122
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:08,671
Yes.

123
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,871
They found Seung Jae so soon because Captain Kang hounded them.

124
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,550
Where did you go today?

125
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,180
Today we went to see Choi Young Bae's wife.

126
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,150
We should find him quickly and send him away...

127
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,020
to keep the kids safe and then you can relax a bit.

128
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,760
If you cared so much about me,

129
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,160
you should've told me sooner.

130
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,861
Oh, my gosh.

131
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:39,571
- Oh, dear. - Gosh, save me.

132
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,331
Oh, that hurt.

133
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,910
Goodness, that really hurt.

134
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,441
Why did you open the door?

135
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,510
I only meant to crack it open so we could hear better.

136
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,250
Did you have to fall on top of me?

137
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,550
Your legs give out so easily.

138
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,880
It's not my legs that are weak. You're heavier than you look.

139
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,790
I'm just as heavy as I look.

140
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,491
How are you...

141
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:07,760
able to go outside?

142
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,831
I don't know the reason.

143
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,601
When I first came here,

144
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:20,471
Captain Kang said there's no way I could go back outside.

145
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,811
I tried, just to find out,

146
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,380
and I found myself on the other side.

147
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,750
- You just crossed over? - Yes.

148
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,680
When I came back through the tree by the store?

149
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:34,650
It's not that great or special on the outside.

150
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,491
The living can't see me or hear me.

151
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,390
I'm practically invisible.

152
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,000
They walk straight through me.

153
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,630
Still,

154
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,000
you get to see the people you miss.

155
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,981
Who do you want to see?

156
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,150
Now that I'm here,

157
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,851
I think a lot of my parents.

158
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:09,890
I only saw them once or twice a year saying...

159
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,691
I had lots of work.

160
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:15,561
On the rare times we talked, I hung up saying I was busy.

161
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:18,231
I meant to call again later.

162
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,871
Back then...

163
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:23,201
I thought I had lots of time left.

164
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,680
They'll be so worried they can't reach their youngest.

165
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,780

I have a lot of information on the kids at the school.

00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:50,201
Tell me if you need them.

169

I will.

Do you meet the families too?

It depends on the situation but I see them sometimes.

And I comfort them in roundabout ways.

175
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:13,420
Do you think I could ask for a favor?

176

Do you want to hear about your family?

177
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:17,920
No, it's not that.

I don't want you to ever...

Why not?

I don't want...

anyone to ever find my body.

There must be a reason why you and Il Yong...

have the special ability.

You've done a lot of good so far,

and there are many more you can help.

I don't want you to waste your time on people like me.

189

Will you do that for me?

190
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,410
Yes, sure.

Yes. He doesn't want us to look for him...

196

or even go see his family.

No wonder.

198

Whenever I ask a question, he beats around the bush with the answer.

Captain Kang says it's because of his wife's pension.

Even so, it felt...

a bit weird.

What can we do?

We can't pry for details of someone's privacy.

How do you know him?

He did something bad to children.

That must be in the past.

ask to meet me here?

In there?

228
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,050
So he could...

take care of his own child.

230
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:09,091
So he'd take the son he loved so much to the afterlife with him.

She doesn't remember what happened to her as a child.

That's enough for me.

In her mother-in-law's cremation urn.

No, he's gone. Like Ro Ha.

I see. They found him sooner than I had expected.

Have you told Captain Kang yet?

293

I came here first. Let's go talk to her together.

I understand, but you can't all come here and interrogate me like this.

Stop denying it. Tell us the truth!

- What? - I knew it.

300
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,281
No wonder I rarely saw him in the village.

301

You folks know me well enough.

302

We've known each other for a long time.

Hey, can you please go see if my kids are doing well?

307
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,791
I want to know if my parents are still alive.

Can you please find out for me?

309
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,490
I want to know if my wife got married again.

310
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,730
- Hold on. Don't be like this. - Why not?

311
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,571
You were all worked up earlier too. I saw it.

312
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:22,470
Il Yong isn't the only one. There's someone else.

313
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,940
What was his name? Kim Wook?

314
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:25,940
Where is he now?

315
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,140
- Did he go outside? - Gosh, that's enough!

All of you, get out.

He has enough on his plate, having to worry about the dead.

319

Why must you make Il Yong worry about the living on top of that?

Stop bothering him. Go home already.

Are you Il Yong's mother or something?

323

- Who are you to step in? - Who do you think you are?

324

I want to know how those on the outside are doing too!

325

Captain Kang, I didn't think you could be like this.

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,170
I conduct a memorial ceremony for my husband and son.

330
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,841
I never once asked anyone to find out how they were doing!

331
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,380
Why are you getting so worked up?

332
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
You must be hiding something from us.

333
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,121
You don't know anything. What's with you people?

334
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,690
Don't get involved.

335
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,490
- Why, you... - Let go!

336
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,160
- Goodness. - You stay out of this.

337
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,031
- Break it up! - I need to talk to Il Yong.

338
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,091
- Let go! - Please, Il Yong...

339
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,301
- That's enough. - Leave him alone!

340
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:25,160
- Let go. - I told you to leave him alone!

341
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:30,103
I came straight here as soon as I heard Choi Young Bae was gone.

342
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,873
Ha Yoon couldn't even come outside for days.

343
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:36,913
But she's with Young Rim. They can be silly and laugh together.

344
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:39,344
I guess they felt cooped up after being stuck at home for days.

345
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:41,514
They stepped out to go to the playground.

346
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:44,054
Thank goodness. Kids understand each other.

347
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,524
This is schisandra berry tea, right? It's very good.

348
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:52,393
Do you think he's really gone for good?

349
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:54,264
What if he shows up again?

350
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,433
This time, he is gone for good.

351
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:58,794
His ashes were hidden in a cremation niche.

352
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,433
But his wife confessed everything...

353
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:01,834
and scattered his ashes at the beach.

354
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,304
How did you find out?

355
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:07,074
What?

356
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,913
Well... Mr. Jung didn't tell you?

357
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,074
Well...

358
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,613
The kids went outside and saw it.

359
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,054
Kids? Who?

360
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:21,554
What? You know, the kids... Il Yong and...

361
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:24,953
Hey, did you dry the schisandra berries yourself?

362
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,524
Sorry? Yes.

363
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:30,363
Call me the next time you do it.

364
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:31,863
It's very good.

365
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,933
It's really good.

366
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:39,474
They're so mean.

367
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,713
What? Who?

368
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:46,584
The villagers.

369
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:50,413
I understand why Captain Kang kept it from them all this time.

370
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:52,984
It's because they're desperate.

371
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:58,024
They all came here without getting the chance to say goodbye.

372
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:02,534
Us too.

373
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,834
My mom passed away, so I don't have a family.

374
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,234
Oh...

375
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,574
What?

376
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,074
Did you guys fight?

377
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,484
Goodness. You're not a kid.

378
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,554
- I explained that... - No.

379
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:26,183
We didn't fight.

380
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:30,054
Then what happened?

381
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:34,064
Well, the villagers came to see Captain Kang...

382
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:35,893
and lashed out at her for not telling them...

383
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,234
about me frequenting the outside world when she knew.

384
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:41,234
We tried to stop the fight. That's what happened.

385
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:43,004
Where is Captain Kang?

386
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:44,834
She stepped out to get some air.

387
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:47,244
Where did she go?

388
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:49,844
She went that way.

389
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:51,514
What?

390
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:14,334
So everyone in the village knows?

391
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:15,834
The fact that I'm alive too?

392
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,734
No, I don't think they know that.

393
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:21,244
They just know that the two of us can visit the outside world.

394
00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:22,344
But you said they saw us.

395
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:24,814
They happened to see you while walking by,

396
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:26,613
so I don't think they heard what you said.

397
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:30,254
Right. Who'd imagine...

398
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:31,853
that one of us could be alive?

399
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,683
Captain Kang is the problem.

400
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:38,554
Goodness. She must've been under a lot of stress all by herself.

401
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:41,224
It's all my fault.

402
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:45,234
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:47,564
No one's at fault here. We're all victims.

404
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,334
Including Captain Kang.

405
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:54,173
This happened because of us, so let's get it sorted out.

406
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:56,574
Gosh.

407
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,413
I never thought she could do this to me. What did she say?

408
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:02,284
Gosh. The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

409
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:06,324
We've known each other for years.

410
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:07,853
Unbelievable.

411
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:14,024
I'm going to...

412
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:18,594
Ms. Buan, come out for a second!

413
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:23,734
You ran off with the money seven years ago,

414
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,403
got caught, and ended up here.

415
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:27,673
Yes. What you did is bad,

416
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,373
but you didn't deserve to die over it.

417
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:32,244
That's why I've been keeping my lips sealed,

418
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:35,514
but I'm going to tell everyone about it!

419
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:37,853
That's only fair for me and Il Yong!

420
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:41,054
Grow up already. You're so selfish!

421
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:42,453
Il Yong, that poor thing...

422
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:44,594
Are you that angry at me for not telling you his secret?

423
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:46,594
Answer, will you?

424
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:49,123
I really will tell everyone.

425
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,764
Ms. Buan, come out at once.

426
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:54,463
Where is she?

427
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:57,173
Where did she go?

428
00:26:58,703 --> 00:26:59,774
Gosh.

429
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:01,974
Was I talking to myself?

430
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:04,643
Gosh, I'm so angry.

431
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:07,244
Ms. Buan!

432
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:21,994
Write down your name, address,

433
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,564
and what you want to know the most.

434
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,234
Just one thing.

435
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:30,373
Then Il Yong and I will go to the address and see.

436
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:33,804
On many occasions, it won't be what you're expecting.

437
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,544
There are times when we can't track down some people.

438
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:37,074
Even if we can find them,

439
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,244
the living can't see me.

440
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:42,913
All I can do is see them and come back.

441
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,453
- That's enough. - Yes.

442
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:47,524
Gosh, we're so grateful.

443
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:48,524
- My gosh. - Write everything down.

444
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:51,893
- Thank you. - I hope they haven't moved.

445
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:02,974
Mr. Jang, why aren't you writing anything down?

446
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:06,074
What?

447
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:10,173
Whatever I'm curious about is already in this neighborhood.

448
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:13,484
- You mean Hyun Ji? - Yes.

449
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:17,484
What about you, Principal?

450
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,353
What?

451
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:24,123
I don't miss anything that I left behind.

452
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,794
I like it here.

453
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:34,064
Those of you who are done can turn it in to us and go.

454
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,834
I love this.

455
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,774
This is great.

456
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:39,574
It really is.

457
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,784
Gosh, are they not here either?

458
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:56,453
Where did they all go?

459
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:00,363
Captain Kang.

460
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:03,693
You weren't in the rest area or at home.

461
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:05,034
I wondered where you had gone.

462
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:09,304
I was getting so angry to sit still, so I left.

463
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,703
But why is the whole neighborhood so quiet?

464
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:14,274
They're all at the school.

465
00:29:15,774 --> 00:29:17,113
The school?

466
00:29:17,113 --> 00:29:19,213
The whole town knows now.

467
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,584
Since everyone knows, we explained everything.

468
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:24,814
We told them to write down their names, addresses,

469
00:29:24,814 --> 00:29:26,883
and anything they miss.

470
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,383
Il Yong and Wook said they'd go out and take a look for them.

471
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,054
They're writing that down now.

472
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,423
You will go to all of those places?

473
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:37,863
We'll get to the ones we can.

474
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:43,173
This will help us get a total census of the town at once.

475
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:49,613
I felt bad asking you to do so much for the town all this time.

476
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,183
It was annoying when I kept asking you questions, wasn't it?

477
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:58,784
It wasn't annoying at all. You're being ridiculous.

478
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:04,254
I heard how hard you've worked from Il Yong.

479
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:06,393
Captain Kang.

480
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:08,524
Yes?

481
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:12,064
You've worked hard by yourself.

482
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:22,143
Let's go.

483
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,173
Sure. Will you go to the school?

484
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:25,413
No, I'll head home.

485
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:27,344
Do you have any makgeolli?

486
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:29,314
- Are you going to have makgeolli? - Yes.

487
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:31,683
I had soju. You should have some too.

488
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:36,193
These are the names and addresses...

489
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:37,494
of the villagers of Industrial Complex Three.

490
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:39,054
I wrote down half of them myself.

491
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,423
The other half will be in Pan Seok's notebook.

492
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:45,294
Then you've become someone who can officially leave that town,

493
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:48,234
along with Il Yong.

494
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,133
You're right.

495
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:53,274
But the principal said this.

496
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:56,673
There must be a reason why I have this ability.

497
00:30:57,613 --> 00:30:59,544
But I just can't think of anything.

498
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:02,383
Pan Seok has Hyun Ji, so it makes sense.

499
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:03,554
But I don't know why...

500
00:31:04,254 --> 00:31:07,754
I can see those people. I really don't.

501
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:12,393
Your mother was in Duon Village.

502
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:16,463
Could there be another family member that you don't know about?

503
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:18,834
Another family member I don't know about?

504
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:19,834
Yes.

505
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,103
Other than Bo Ra?

506
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:24,334
I heard Bo Ra wasn't your biological daughter.

507
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,244
Do you have to share blood to be a family?

508
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:31,014
You, me, and Pan Seok are a family.

509
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,984
And Bo Ra is practically our family now too.

510
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:39,554
Anyway, I'm sure there's a reason why you can see the village.

511
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:52,393
Do you know who I am?

512
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:01,943
Who is she?

513
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,014
Who is she to keep appearing in my dreams?

514
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:09,514
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

515
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:12,054
Even if you present them with evidence, they just deny it.

516
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:14,683
I asked them about Sang Chul several times too,

517
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,024
but these punks claim they don't know anything.

518
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:17,893
Don't worry.

519
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:27,504
I told the other officer several times already.

520
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,564
I don't know where he is.

521
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:34,574
Who would know if you don't?

522
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:37,314
Goliath?

523
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,814
Guys like us who just do drop offs...

524
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:42,514
don't even know Goliath's face.

525
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:44,784
Sang Chul, that traitor,

526
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:48,054
knew the cops would come after us, so he ran off.

527
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:51,524
Hey.

528
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:54,363
Where would a dead guy run off to?

529
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:56,994
Sang Chul is dead?

530
00:32:56,994 --> 00:32:59,363
Yes. Inside a container.

531
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,463
He said this before he died.

532
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:07,903
"Gwang Taek. You're mistaken."

533
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:12,774
Gwang Taek. You're mistaken.

534
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:14,244
You're mistaken.

535
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,923
I have no idea what you're talking about.

536
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,754
Gosh, I should leave for today.

537
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:28,963
You know the syringe you stabbed Choi Jung A with...

538
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,463
is at NFS, right?

539
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:35,534
Ko Sang Chul hid that nicely before he died.

540
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,703
He handed it over after he died.

541
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:44,574
After you stabbed him to death with a knife.

542
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:51,583
Let's meet again.

543
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,463
I like the mood here.

544
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,764
Hey, Detective Shin.

545
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:10,773
Where's Jong A?

546
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,673
Jong A? I'm not sure.

547
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:13,943
Where is she?

548
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:16,074
Ms. Lee is in her office. Should I call her for you?

549
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:17,673
No, it's fine.

550
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:20,644
Okay.

551
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:25,054
We didn't order this.

552
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:27,854
This is a new menu that I developed myself.

553
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,124
It's called Cacao Chocolate Chip Oh-so-sweet Very-sweet...

554
00:34:30,124 --> 00:34:31,793
It's Totally Crazy Latte.

555
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,394
I named it myself too. Isn't it cute?

556
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,434
This is on the house.

557
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:39,133
Have a taste and tell me what you think.

558
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,233
Okay. Thank you.

559
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,664
- Sure. Enjoy. - Thanks.

560
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:43,874
He's Jong A's friend.

561
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,574
He's overly enthusiastic. And he really likes to eat too.

562
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:47,874
He's a good guy.

563
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,184
The year before last,

564
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:57,414
there were some guys who ran off to China.

565
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,423
They're in Korea now.

566
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:03,724
The guys who were trailing after you?

567
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:04,793
Yes.

568
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:07,523
They hit Nam Kook with a car and Yeo Na too.

569
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:14,804
Where did you see them?

570
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:17,034
I saw them in prison.

571
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,434
They were visiting Lee Dong Min.

572
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:21,874
Those guys met Lee Dong Min?

573
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:23,813
Yes.

574
00:35:24,744 --> 00:35:26,273
And why were you there?

575
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:28,414
Lee Dong Min sent...

576
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,184
a letter to me.

577
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:33,784
What letter? Was it like a threat?

578
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,753
It's hard to call it a threat.

579
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:39,324
Anyway, he sent me several letters every now and then.

580
00:35:42,094 --> 00:35:44,764
So you're saying that's why you went to see Lee Dong Min.

581
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:46,804
Yes.

582
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:51,534
Don't smirk.

583
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:53,773
You make me want to vomit.

584
00:35:55,974 --> 00:35:57,213
It's been a while.

585
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,773
What made you come all the way here?

586
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:01,443
You called me here.

587
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,213
Was this the big picture...

588
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:07,153
with your letters?

589
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:09,624
Crazy jerk.

590
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,124
If you got locked up for committing a crime, you should repent.

591
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:16,394
Stop trying to pull some ridiculous stunt.

592
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,363
A ridiculous stunt? Me?

593
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:30,074
You know that your minion who came to see you a little while ago...

594
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,383
was the guy who killed Detective Shin's fiancee, right?

595
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:38,054
He ran away to China back then, but now he made his way back.

596
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:43,083
And he came here.

597
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:50,793
Is this still not a ridiculous stunt?

598
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:53,764
What are those guys plotting?

599
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,534
I don't know that either.

600
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:59,273
I just mean I have a hunch.

601
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:01,043
You have a good hunch.

602
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:03,443
You said you kept having weird dreams lately.

603
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:06,813
But I'm not sure if that dream is related to Lee Dong Min or not.

604
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:10,613
There's just been a lot of strange people and circumstances lately.

605
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:13,624
Detective Shin.

606
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:18,523
You should just be careful from now on. I wanted to tell you that.

607
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:23,434
The person Lee Dong Min was after in the first place was you.

608
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:27,963
I should find the guys who came back from China first.

609
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,773
I'll keep in touch.

610
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,574
Gosh, should I not have told him?

611
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:42,083
(We're closed for today.)

612
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:49,684
Captain Kang.

613
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,793
Captain Kang, are you in here?

614
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,793
Didn't you see the sign out front?

615
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:04,534
I didn't come to buy anything. I came to apologize.

616
00:38:04,773 --> 00:38:06,403
Just leave if you're going to say what you don't mean.

617
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:07,874
No, I'm serious.

618
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:09,443
Yesterday,

619
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:13,514
I wasn't here to confront you but to ask for a favor.

620
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:18,313
I thought I'd never get the chance to hear about my kids,

621
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:20,583
but hearing how Il Yong could leave the village...

622
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,753
had me go ballistic.

623
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,693
I must've lost my mind.

624
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:29,563
You haven't told anyone about...

625
00:38:30,563 --> 00:38:33,164
how I duped people out of their money while alive.

626
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:35,563
Maybe I should tell people that.

627
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:37,503
You should.

628
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,974
I don't deserve your kindness, so tell everyone what I did.

629
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:44,514
Thanks.

630
00:38:45,974 --> 00:38:47,043
And I'm sorry.

631
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:49,943
Gosh.

632
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:54,383
Fine. Head on out, then.

633
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:55,753
Enjoy this as well.

634
00:38:57,554 --> 00:39:00,063
Thanks for this. I'll enjoy it.

635
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,023
It's to shut up those I dislike.

636
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:06,063
Goodness.

637
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,003
Did you forget something?

638
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:14,874
Hye Ju?

639
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,813
Why did you keep it from me all this time?

640
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:26,083
Are you here to talk about Il Yong too?

641
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:31,324
You'll be the death of me, Captain Kang.

642
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:34,923
What's the matter?

643
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:43,104
I heard there was an incident at the supermarket earlier.

644
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:44,633
You see,

645
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:49,503
even though Captain Kang knew that we could leave the village,

646
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:54,383
she never once asked for a personal favor.

647
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,684
Instead, she asked me to look out for all of you.

648
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:58,914
She had me check on...

649
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:01,083
Hye Ju's father on his 70th birthday,

650
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:04,423
check if Ms. Buan's eldest son got into college,

652
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,463
and moved into their new house.

653
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,664
Captain Kang asked that of me, so I went to see them all.

654
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:15,034
Think about it, you guys.

655
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,574
Didn't Captain Kang relay the news?

656
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:27,744
If people had found out,

657
00:40:28,113 --> 00:40:29,744
it would've been a nuisance for Il Yong.

658
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:32,184
I kept it a secret to keep the peace around here.

659
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,354
But whether it's among the living or the dead,

660
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:37,324
I guess there can be no secrets.

661

Can you run that against the camera footage at the airport?

666

Thanks.

667
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,923
His name is Jang Do Ri.

668
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:46,094
Jang Do Ri? He was named after a tool.

669
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:48,664
Fake passport, fake name.

670
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:50,394
He arrived in Korea a month ago through Haecheon Harbor.

671
00:41:50,394 --> 00:41:52,934
That's around the time I saw him at the detention center.

672
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:54,903
He deposited money in Lee Dong Min's commissary account,

673
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,204
so I followed him out of curiosity.

674
00:41:57,104 --> 00:41:58,304
This is where he ended up.

675

When I saw him again...

677
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,583
Jang Do Ri and Goliath were together in this room.

678
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:13,854
That's right.

679
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,784
Jang Do Ri's the one who told Kim Pil Joong to lay low.

680
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:18,793
But what I want to know is this.

681
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:20,293
That's...

682
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:22,693
what he did?

683
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,164
I want to know who this "he" is.

684
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:27,403
There's someone else calling the shots.

685
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,673
Goliath isn't the gang leader?

686
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:35,104
Jang Do Ri is in Korea...

687
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,273
because he was summoned by this person.

Welcome.

Do you think that it was Lee Dong Min?

696
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:08,474
He said that there is something big.

697
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:12,273
It seemed like he was testing me.

698
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:15,543
Even someone like Lee Dong Min can't run a drug operation...

or summon a killer from China while incarcerated.

700
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:22,284
I'm sure he's been receiving outside help.

701
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:25,554
We must figure out what he's up to.

702
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:30,434
Did you catch my nine o'clock?

703
00:43:30,434 --> 00:43:32,164
Yes, they were also there when we went in.

704
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:29,753
Hold on. A GPS tracker?

705
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:33,224
Yes, check if it's transmitting clearly.

706
00:44:37,863 --> 00:44:39,994
It's heading toward the Mahyeon-dong Intersection.

707

Whose car is it?

I'll tell you later. Sure.

Who could it be that he's bothering to track?

Shall we proceed?

Don't.

712
00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:01,224
He spotted us, so this is as far as we'll go today.

713

End the surveillance.

Right. Wook's a little busy.

Let's go.

720
00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:39,554
What's wrong? Is something up?

721
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:42,894
Mom wants me to attend an English camp on Jeju Island.

722
00:45:43,563 --> 00:45:44,594
An English camp?

723
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:49,604
Yes. I mentioned how my friends were going to English camps abroad,

724
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:53,003
and my mom's been trying to get me to Jeju Island at least.

725
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,273
It's why she has been late on paying the rent.

726
00:45:58,344 --> 00:45:59,374
Are you going to go?

727
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:02,744
Of course not. I told her to get a refund.

728
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:04,184
She wants you to go...

729
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:06,184
so that you wouldn't feel intimidated around your friends.

730
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:08,724
As if that would make me feel small.

731
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,354
It's not chump change and costs over 1,000 dollars.

732
00:46:11,923 --> 00:46:14,963
It's like I always have to clean up her mess.

733
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:17,934
You're like an old lady in a young girl's suit.

734
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:18,934
Who do you get that from?

735
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:24,604
It can't be my mom since she's reckless.

736
00:46:25,374 --> 00:46:26,934
I doubt it's my dad either.

737
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:32,074
The wisest one in my life is you.

738
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:33,813
Me?

739
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:37,113
I guess that's true.

740

I take back how I called you an old lady.

741
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:51,733
You're just a middle school student...

742
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,104
who is kind and considerate.

743
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,483
You haven't been around, so I thought you had left.

744
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:12,213
I've been busy going around running errands.

745
00:47:13,153 --> 00:47:16,253
Is my daughter doing well?

746
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,624
Of course.

747
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:20,894
She hasn't been skipping her meals and is doing fine.

748
00:47:21,164 --> 00:47:23,094
The village people love her.

749
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:25,363
You know how she is.

750
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,974
She loves to read books and enjoys singing.

751
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:47,113
You don't have to worry about Alice anymore.

752
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:56,724
Thank you.

753
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:06,673
I'll visit again, okay?

754
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:44,914
You won't see Wook and Il Yong for a while.

755
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:46,773
They'll be very busy.

756
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:54,083
Oh, boy.

757
00:48:57,224 --> 00:49:00,624
Anyway, the kids must be excited to come back to school.

758
00:49:00,824 --> 00:49:03,523
That jerk is now gone, so it's safe again.

759
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,463
The kids must be happy.

760
00:49:05,994 --> 00:49:07,063
Yes, for sure.

761
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:15,704
Why not suggest a camping trip to the kids? They'll love it.

762
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:19,574
It looks like you'll love it more than the kids will.

We've read this book twice.

766
00:49:34,523 --> 00:49:35,994
Just once more.

767
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,133
All right.

768
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,764
I want to pee.

769
00:49:43,264 --> 00:49:44,704
Alice, you want to pee?

770
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:46,833
I'll take you to the restroom.

- Yes. - Yes.

00:50:00,054 --> 00:50:02,153
- Isn't it such a fun book? - Yes.

775
00:50:02,554 --> 00:50:05,394
No, go away. I told you to go away!

- No! - What's wrong?

777
00:50:07,594 --> 00:50:09,423
I said, no!

778

Go away!

781
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:17,403
Ha Yoon! What's the matter?

782
00:50:17,403 --> 00:50:18,604
What happened?

783
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:21,543
- He's scary. - What?

784
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:25,014
What happened?

785
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:28,144
No idea. I just said hi. She suddenly...

786
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:31,054
Be careful, Young Rim. He's dangerous.

Hey, Young Rim. Come here.

788
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,253
Ha Yoon, what's wrong?

789
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:40,394
You idiot. He's just like that woman.

790
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,124
Woman?

791
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:45,333
What do you mean I'm like a woman?

792
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,474
No, he's not like her.

793

Who is this woman you're talking about?

794

- I'm scared. - Gosh, all right.

795
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:02,644
Get going.

796
00:51:03,213 --> 00:51:04,914
Go.

797
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:07,684
It's okay, Ha Yoon.

798
00:51:07,684 --> 00:51:10,153
He left. He's gone.

799
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:13,124
Yes, he left. Don't look.

800
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:14,563
Good girl. It's okay.

801
00:51:14,994 --> 00:51:16,994
Gosh, I have no idea what's going on.

802
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:20,333
The woman who gave them banana milk is the culprit.

803
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:23,563
But she thinks you look like her.

804
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,673
What I don't understand is...

805
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:27,844
I saw them every day while getting ready for the field day.

806
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:29,943
Even on the field day, we were together all day.

807
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:31,514
But she was totally fine around me that day.

808
00:51:31,974 --> 00:51:35,883
She saw Young Rim drinking banana milk that day.

809
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:37,854
Maybe she was reminded of that?

810
00:51:38,813 --> 00:51:41,784
- Like trauma? - Yes, a scary memory.

811
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:45,594
He must have something in common with her.

00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,463
His face?

813
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,693
Did she have a similar hairstyle?

814
00:51:52,594 --> 00:51:53,633
Hold on.

815
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:57,304
The Blue Bird Hope Foundation, right?

816
00:51:57,304 --> 00:51:58,704
I used to donate to this organization.

817
00:51:59,903 --> 00:52:02,304
I guess you did too. That's great.

818
00:52:02,304 --> 00:52:04,773
Oh, I volunteered there briefly back in college.

819
00:52:05,144 --> 00:52:06,874
And you still wear this T-shirt?

820
00:52:07,313 --> 00:52:09,744
Why not? It's cute.

821
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:19,554
Perhaps, Ha Yoon saw...

822
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,594
What?

823
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:34,640
Art therapy for Ha Yoon?

824
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:37,281
Yes. I don't think banana milk is the only trigger.

825
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:40,580
We believe it had something to do with Detective Ko's T-shirt too.

826
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,421
Okay, I'll try.

827
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,790
But it may take a while.

828
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,991
Ha Yoon has to want to tell me what's on her mind.

829
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:53,560
She went through a lot recently, you know.

830
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:56,160
Of course, I totally understand.

831
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,270
Let's do it when you think Ha Yoon is ready.

832
00:52:59,631 --> 00:53:01,301
No need to rush.

833
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:05,370
Hello.

834
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,571
Is Ms. Kim Jin Ah here?

835
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:10,241
Oh, did she live here in the past?

836
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:11,750
I have no idea who she is.

837
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,580
Did she move?

838
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,480
Gosh, how would I know?

839
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:18,520
Wait. Could you help me find out where she lives now?

840
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:27,290
Gosh, I'm parched.

841
00:53:28,031 --> 00:53:29,261
- Really? - Yes.

842
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,131
I'll go get you something to drink.

843
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,781
Hey, you.

844
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:49,520
Of course, I've eaten.

845
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,020
Yes, all right.

846
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:54,190
Bye.

849

Our elder son will visit us on the weekend with his kids.

850
00:54:07,671 --> 00:54:08,940
- Here. - Thanks.

851
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,111
We haven't heard from our younger son in a while.

852
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,410
Call him.

853
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,580
He said the investigation was keeping him busy.

854
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,551
He told me he'd visit us once the investigation was over.

855
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:22,651
Let's just wait.

856
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:26,120
I'm worried he'd get hurt while going after vicious criminals.

857
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,091
Goodness. Let's just finish this.

858
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:44,040
I don't want you to ever visit my family.

859
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:47,370
I have a personal issue.

Captain Kang says it's because of his wife's pension.

Jung Ji Hoon?

864
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,361
Didn't he say his son lived in the US?

865
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:14,270
I think it's somewhere around here.

866
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:17,701
How come I can't find it?

867
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:21,011
Goodness.

868
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:37,721
- Are you all right? - Yes.

869
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:41,761
Oh, she's...

870
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:04,281
Who is she?

871
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:08,421
If I met her, I would remember who she is.

872
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,761
Could there be another family member that you don't know about?

873
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:20,600
No way. That can't be.

874
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,881
Wook, get him. That's Pil Joong!

Hey!

Hey! Get out.

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,551
Get out of the car.

Hey, you. Get out of the car.

Hey! Get out!

She's a bad woman.

00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:22,921
Can we find her with just a T-shirt?

887
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:26,091
I'd like to find one of your long-time benefactors.

888
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:28,020
If they're watching us,

can't I watch them?

Did you say "Oh Il Yong?"

891

I'm still looking for him.

892

What now? What should I do?

893
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:37,131
We must find where they left the body.

894
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,431
You're still able to leave the village...

895
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:41,500
and Wook will help you somehow.
