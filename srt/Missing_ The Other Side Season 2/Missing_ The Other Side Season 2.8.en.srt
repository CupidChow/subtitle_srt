We found him!

Yes, I'm sure of it. It's Ro Ha.

But we'll wait for Forensics to confirm it.

It's not like you to be this certain of something.

00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:18,556
Well, this morning,

10
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,126
I ran into three mountain deities...

11
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:24,537
who pointed me in the right direction.

12
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:26,897
Captain.

13
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,007
We found this at the foot of his remains.

14
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,146
- A boy's shoe. - Right.

15
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:37,476
Captain, I brought him over.

16
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:40,717
Ro Ha... Did you find him?

17
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:42,887
Yes.

18
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:47,727
Do you perhaps recognize this?

19
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:59,167
I bought that for him when he turned eight.

20
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:06,477
Kids that age grow up so fast,

21
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,146
so I got them in a bigger size.

22
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:16,816
He said that his toes felt like they were swimming.

23
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:24,256
Where did you find this?

24
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,327
This trail...

25
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:32,797
He used to come here often for hikes with his mother.

26
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,206
My guess is that he came up here looking for her.

27
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:45,217
Ro Ha.

28
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,317
Ro Ha...

Ro Ha...

00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:04,836
Ro Ha!

31
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,246
It's Dad.

32
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:21,186
I love you, Ro Ha.

Who do you mean?

38
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,607
This detective I know.

39
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,446
You didn't feel anything?

40
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,217
What do you mean?

41
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,386
Ro Ha disappeared right before our eyes.

42
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:05,417
It happened to Eun Hee and Seung Jae that way too.

43
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:07,886
They were here before you arrived.

44
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:12,626
This is what this place is like.

45
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,667
If your body's found on the outside,

46
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,097
you disappear without a trace.

47
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,537
I still can't believe I'm dead...

48
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,006
and people disappear too?

49
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,076
What's next?

50
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,946
What comes after that?

51
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:32,376
I don't know. That's all I know.

52
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,186
What did you do to Ro Ha?

53
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:38,157
That was you, wasn't it?

54
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:42,125
Someone on the outside found his remains.

55
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,657
That's why he disappeared.

56
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:45,727
No, him winning the race.

57
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:48,626
Oh, that?

58
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,897
A mosquito bit Sang Yoon on the leg.

59
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:58,376
Ji Woo said he fell and hurt his toe.

60
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:00,435
Ha Yoon and Young Rim...

61
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:02,847
couldn't run as fast because they'd hurt their legs.

62
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:04,876
What?

63
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,917
Ro Ha and the other kids all did their best.

64
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:16,056
They helped him out voluntarily.

65
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,696
Isn't it beautiful?

66
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:24,837
It was the greatest race I ever saw.

67
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,267
About now,

68
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:32,876
Ro Ha will be with his mom, right?

69
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:35,276
He believed if he came first,

70
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,446
he could run to his mom.

71
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,746
I hope so.

72
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:43,086
This is such a strange place.

73
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,386
You realized that now?

74
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:48,686
At first, I was so scared I wanted to run away.

75
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:50,626
But now...

76
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:53,926
I want to know about this place.

77
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,136
Thank you.

78
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:04,306
Like you said,

79
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,876
it was a great race.

80
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,446
I could take the bus.

81
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:14,316
Goliath's still at large. It's dangerous.

82
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:16,616
Your place isn't safe either.

83
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,816
I was going to move anyway.

84
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,726
The women gossip too much.

85
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:23,326
Bo Ra was getting stressed out.

86
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,026
Until I find a place,

87
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,956
Bo Ra and I will stay with a friend.

88
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:29,826
Wouldn't it be safer to stay with Wook for now?

89
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:32,037
He seemed to think so too.

90
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:38,537
He would.

91
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:45,076
I heard you'd paid the rent I owed the landlady.

92
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:49,147
I'd kept this in my bag to pay you back when we met.

93
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:50,787
Thank you.

94
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,885
You could've taken your time.

95
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,826
No. I'll put it in here.

96
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,626
Do you know how to use the smartwatch?

97
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,667
Yes.

98
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:06,496
I'll use it if I so much as see a strange shadow.

99
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,436
Go see Bo Ra. I'll wait by the school.

100
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,146
What are you eating?

101
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,917
- You saw? - Did you?

102
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:20,816
Bo Ra.

103
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:23,886
Mom.

104
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,356
You guys go ahead.

105
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:26,386
- See you. - Bye.

106
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:28,857
Hello.

107
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,756
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

108
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:32,995
Are you allowed to walk out now?

109
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,556
Can we go home, then?

110
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,696
No. We'll move someplace else.

111
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,435
Until we find a place,

112
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,767
I'll stay with Aunt Ji Young.

113
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,806
I think you should stay where you are now.

114
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,136
Okay. I'd like that too.

115
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,346
Are they nice to you?

116
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,407
Yes.

117
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:52,416
Dad acts like he doesn't care,

118
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,046
and Jjonga's a girl's best friend.

119
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,217
Mr. Jang's always on my side.

120
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,756
- Enjoy yourself. - Thank you.

121
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:06,656
What?

122
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:07,956
Show me your stamp.

123
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,267
Hang on.

124
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:11,595
- Here. - Okay.

125
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:12,736
I won two.

126
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,965
No, you stamped this on yourself.

127
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,166
What are you talking about?

128
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,206
I want one more.

129
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:20,536
Just give her one more.

130
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,176
- Two baskets! - Yes!

131
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,507
Thank you.

132
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,945
Where did you get all this?

133
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,986
From the spring that never runs dry...

134
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,855
and always replenishes itself.

135
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,315
That's a true miracle.

136
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:35,486
Because this village itself is a miracle.

137
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,396
If you think of it that way, everything makes sense.

138
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:40,055
- Here. - Give me one more.

139
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,355
No way.

140
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,997
Detective Ko, take one yourself.

141
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,396
Yes, take something for participating.

142
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,836
It's weirder if you don't get anything.

143
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,407
Show me your stamp.

144
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,047
- I don't have one. - You don't?

145
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:57,175
If you don't have one,

146
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:00,617
then you just have to get one.

147
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,216
Let's see your other hand.

148
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,456
This is for Ro Ha.

149
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,555
It's a plaque of appreciation.

150
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:16,566
Thanks to you, Ro Ha finished the race in first place.

151
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,466
I didn't do anything.

152
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:21,397
- Thank you. - See?

153
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,537
Isn't it nice to get something?

154
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:26,237
Yes.

155
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:27,836
See you.

156
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,507
- Who's next? - Me.

157
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,517
Hey, Lee Young Rim!

158
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,216
I told you not to drink it!

159
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,386
But it tastes good.

160
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:41,417
You're so silly.

161
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,757
You can't have banana milk.

162
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:45,426
It's bad.

163
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:49,596
Young Rim, Ha Yoon.

164
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,537
Why are you fighting after a fun day?

165
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,037
What's it about?

166
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,566
That.

167
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:01,106
Stupid Young Rim was drinking banana milk.

168
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:05,247
Can't he?

169
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:06,845
Is he allergic?

170
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,916
That's the reason we can't go home...

171
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,816
or see our moms and dads.

172
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,786
I'm sorry. I won't drink it again.

173
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:16,886
Ha Yoon.

174
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,926
Gosh, what's up with them?

175
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:27,066
Did he drink this?

176
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,336
Yes, I gave it to him earlier.

177
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:33,576
Young Rim was drinking it and Ha Yoon told him not to.

178
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,706
Something about this being the reason they're here.

179
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,976
I should've told you about that. I forgot.

180
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,917
You can't give them banana milk.

181
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,117
Why not?

182
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:49,055
Alice is sleepy. I'll put her down to sleep,

183
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,226
then I'll tell you.

184
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,637
She must've been exhausted. She went right to sleep.

185
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:07,576
Where were we so far?

186
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:08,976
Oh, right.

187
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:12,445
Some darn woman gave the kids...

188
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:16,046
cartons of banana milk when they were in the playground.

189
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,287
They drank that and then fell asleep.

190
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:21,085
When Ha Yoon woke up,

191
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:24,026
Young Rim was fast asleep next to her.

192
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:26,326
The woman was watching TV. She looked at Ha Yoon,

193
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:30,596
complained that she'd woken up, and gave her more banana milk.

194
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,866
She cried and said she didn't want any,

195
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,106
but when she woke up, she was here.

196
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,407
I remember it...

197
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:41,747
like it was yesterday.

198
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:47,017
Where are we?

199
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,417
I don't know.

200
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,627
Don't be scared.

201
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,566
Are you brother and sister?

202
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,637
We're not.

203
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,167
He's stupid. He can't even read yet.

204
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:12,537
So don't bother my friend.

205
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,706
Are you protecting him?

206
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:20,377
Because we're friends.

207
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:23,417
I want to go home.

208
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,716
We live in Yonggi-dong.

209
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,586
Where is this place?

210
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,086
Lady.

211
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,826
Take me to my mom.

212
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,127
Please?

213
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:43,606
How could she do that to the sweet kids?

214
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,007
They don't know who she is?

215
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,946
No. They'd never seen her before.

216
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,206
It was 15 years ago already.

217
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:54,517
If Young Rim and Ha Yoon were alive,

218
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:57,987
they'd be such beautiful, bright college students.

219
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:03,257
Have you told Pan Seok about this?

220
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:05,127
Yes.

221
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,797
Ha Yoon and Young Rim...

222
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,497
went through something like that?

223
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,196
How can we find the person who gave them the banana milk?

224
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:18,066
Whenever he has a moment, he asks me about the villagers.

225
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,605
"When did they come here?"

226
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,236
"What happened before they died?"

227
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,846
Then he writes down everything I tell him.

228
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:26,377
That's what he's best at.

229
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,487
That's how we found Ro Ha too.

230
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,047
My gosh.

231
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,056
Both you...

232
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,656
and Mr. Jang worked so hard to find him.

233
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:40,997
I know because Il Yong told me.

234
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,326
I felt so grateful and ashamed...

235
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,137
that I couldn't even show that I knew.

236
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,836
We keep on receiving from you without doing anything.

237
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,537
Gosh, don't say that.

238
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,806
You always cook for us.

239
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,476
Thank you for saying that.

240
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,547
Speaking of which...

241
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,716
Why do you always cook for us?

242
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,056
Well...

243
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:13,297
Someone who lived here for a long time...

244
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,167
said this to me a while back.

245
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:19,367
"People don't become useless when they die."

246
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:22,466
"If you're useless, you're as good as dead."

247
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:27,836
I see. So the reason you always cook for us...

248
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,575
What are you two talking about?

249
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,936
You didn't even hear me coming in.

250
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:33,647
There you are, Mr. Jang.

251
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,247
We were talking about Young Rim and Ha Yoon.

252
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:37,747
Oh, I see.

253
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:41,017
Gosh, I'm exhausted. I helped them tidy up.

254
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,686
Il Yong and Detective Ko are still working there.

255
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,055
- I see. - Can someone...

256
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:48,195
- get me a glass of water? - Sure.

257
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:49,267
No, I'll go.

258
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:52,195
I know where all the glasses are because it's my kitchen.

259
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,237
Goodness.

260
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,576
I think Captain Kang always cooks for everyone...

261
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:07,547
because she wishes to remain useful even if she's dead.

262
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:10,346
Did she say that?

263
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,117
That's not exactly what she said.

264
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:16,856
But I think so.

265
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:18,826
What are you saying?

266
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:23,926
What?

267
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,206
Hey, what about this?

268
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,907
Oh, it's Mr. Jang's.

269
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,476
Do you take care of everyone's laundry?

270
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:38,376
No, everyone washes their own underwear.

271
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,152
I only take care of the ones left in the washer.

272
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,547
I'm in charge of laundry.

273
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:44,887
Mr. Jang is in charge of cooking, and Wook cleans the house.

274
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:47,956
The three of us take turns taking the dogs out for a walk...

275
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:50,487
There are four of us now, including you.

276
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:55,027
Anyway, Mr. Jang is very excited that you now live with us.

277
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,426
Well, I'm a pretty good cook.

278
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,167
Hey!

279
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,037
I'll take these upstairs.

280
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,187
Okay, I'll take care of the ones for the rooms downstairs.

281
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:05,476
Thank you!

282
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,446
Ouch.

Whenever I eat anything at the Industrial Complex Three,

I get hungry so quickly.

It's so odd.

- I know. - I guess even the food vanishes.

297

What can we do? We should just eat again.

298

Oh, you're back.

299

Hey, Jjonga. We found Ro Ha.

Really? That's amazing.

We found him thanks to you.

302
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:27,987
You told Detective Baek the exact location.

303
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,825
I can't believe you spelled it out for him like that. How daring.

304

I can't do that.

Hey, be careful. Very careful.

It was already the tenth field day.

It has become our biggest annual event.

If the kids were alive,

351

they'd be in high school or in college now.

352

When I see them, I feel happy and sad at the same time.

353

My heart breaks for them even as I'm smiling.

354

Those beautiful flowers...

355
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:05,277
were cut before they could even bloom.

356
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:09,816
They say there is no paradise where there are no kids.

357
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:13,287
These children shouldn't be here...

358
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:17,236
even if it means this place will end up becoming utterly miserable.

359
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,927
They should have never ended up here in the first place.

360
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:26,666
And...

361

my dear Ro Ha.

362
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:33,707
That boy came here all alone eight years ago.

363
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:38,007
He finally left today, and everyone applauded him.

364
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:42,606
He always ate two bowls of rice at a time...

365
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,846
because he wanted to become stronger.

366
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:47,717
And he won the race in the end.

367
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:52,356
I'm so glad that Ro Ha could leave like that.

I'm truly grateful...

I hope you can be born into a world where only good adults live.

Do you think it'll help Ro Ha go to a better place?

Once a month for ten months.

449
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,875

00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,556
There was nothing special, but it's still unpleasant.

452
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,425
Why did he send those letters?

453
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:12,255
And why didn't Wook tell us?

454
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,154
In case we'd worry, of course.

455
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:16,796
Wook is a talkative one, but not when it comes to himself.

456
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,096
What if he's trying to pull something in prison?

457
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:24,506
Tell me about it. I'm worried about that too.

Don't worry. You're prettier.

Oh, right.

469
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,644
You know what? People call you everyone's want-to-be dad.

Why is that?

472
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:15,885
Because you're a really handsome dad.

473
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:17,755
So everyone wants a dad like you.

474
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,996
So I made something loud and clear.

475
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:23,895
That my beauty comes from him.

476
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,765
What are you talking about?

477
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,596
You take after me. You're my daughter.

478
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,635
No way. Look.

479

What on earth, you two?

481
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,874
The moment she saw me, she went like this.

482
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,776
I wonder whom she got it from. She's something.

483

I said I take after you.

484

Mom, he denied it like crazy...

485

that he wasn't my dad at first.

486

He said he was the man in the photo...

487
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,556
but not my dad.

No.

She's hyper. She ate more than usual.

495
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:24,056
Why did you do that earlier?

496
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,195
First love?

497
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:29,725
Well, I told the truth.

498
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:32,194
You dumped me.

499
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:33,536
Not that.

500
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,135
Bo Ra keeps calling you Dad.

501
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,736
And she thinks she takes after you.

502
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:44,106
I kind of think she takes after me.

503
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,356
There you go again changing the subject with a joke.

504
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,576
You haven't changed one bit.

505
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:53,315
I clearly told her that I'm not her dad.

506
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:54,986
But she didn't believe me.

507
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:58,885
Maybe there's a reason why she believes I'm her dad.

508
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,326
She's just mistaken.

509
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:04,225
I'll talk her into it.

510
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:07,464
The other day, I was so confused...

511
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,194
with the police around that I couldn't tell her.

512
00:31:09,195 --> 00:31:10,505
Do it later.

513
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,306
Bo Ra's going through a hard time now.

514
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,846
I'll find a house and take her as soon as possible.

515
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,445
Thank you for being nice to her.

516
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,016
I know you're doing this for her sake,

517
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:28,515
but if this takes long,

518
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,685
she may be heartbroken more.

519
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:32,526
And the same goes for me.

520
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,066
Bo Ra, are you okay?

521
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,404
You ate too much.

522
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,336
I don't have an upset stomach.

523
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,006
- Let's hurry for dessert. - Just a moment.

524
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,026
Captain.

525
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:11,965
Captain.

526
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,465
- Captain. - What?

527
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,945
Captain, did you want to see me?

528
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,345
Yes, Hye Ju.

529
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,515
Can you watch the supermarket with Alice for a while?

530
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:33,685
I'll be right back.

531
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,256
Sure.

532
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:50,836
Detective Ko, are you home?

533
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:53,405
Detective Ko.

534
00:32:57,806 --> 00:32:58,806
Hey.

535
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,816
You were home. Let's talk inside.

536
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:08,856
What is this about?

537
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:14,026
My house was robbed on the day we had our field day.

538
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:15,425
It was robbed?

539
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,766
Was something taken?

540
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,236
A doll I had.

541
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:24,405
Why did someone steal your doll?

542
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,404
Was the robber a child?

543
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,606
No, it wasn't.

544
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,145
I know who the robber is,

545
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,575
and I was hoping you'd catch the person.

546
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:35,816
Can I trust you with this since you're a detective?

547
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,486
I even saw that you had a gun.

548
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:41,786
Who is the culprit?

549
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,056
But first,

550
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,256
I'd like to keep this matter between us.

551
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,966
It will only trouble people if they find out,

552
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,136
and the children will be scared.

553
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,875
I'll tread lightly, so just tell me who the robber is.

554
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,305
Choi Young Bae.

555
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:06,075
He's a nasty man who targets children.

556
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:09,716
Gosh.

557
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:12,616
He's a lot taller than you...

558
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:13,915
and has a gaunt face.

559
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:17,325
His eyes are murky like those of a dead fish.

560
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:20,326
He never looks at people straight in the eyes.

561
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:23,224
If you see anyone...

562
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:26,026
who wasn't present at the field day, capture him.

563
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:31,165
A sex offender who targets minors would most likely be hiding out...

564
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:33,905
near the school or a place where kids often go.

565
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,006
That's why he should be apprehended immediately.

566
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:38,875
Got it.

567
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,015
Il Yong?

568
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:53,296
Where is he going?

569
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:18,185
(Safety First)

570
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,396
Are you sure you agreed to meet her here?

571
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:28,094
The theatre is that way.

572
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,342
We'll head over there together once she's done at the academy.

573
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:32,066
I see. Got it.

574
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:34,066
Enjoy the movie...

575
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,636
but don't stay out too late.

576
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:39,805
What has you smiling?

577
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,506
I'm happy, that's all.

578
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,775
I just had a meal with my mom and dad.

579
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:45,475
It was our first meal as a family.

580
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:50,816
Enjoy the movie, then. I'll see you at home.

581
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:53,485
Got it. I'll get going.

582
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:54,486
Have fun.

583
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:12,636
Excuse me.

584
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,375
I knew Pil Joong wouldn't show up in this neighbourhood.

585
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:27,345
What are you doing here?

586
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:28,875
Gosh, you startled me.

587
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,956
Mr. Jung, I could ask you the same thing.

588
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:34,886
I was out plucking weeds. What about you?

589
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:37,086
Me? I was out patrolling...

590
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,096
to confirm that it was safe around the school.

591
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:40,825
By the way,

592
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,995
have you seen anyone suspicious around here?

593
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:46,296
Someone suspicious?

594
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,966
Out of everyone here,

595
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:52,906
you're the one who's acting most suspiciously.

596
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:54,935
Me?

597
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,805
Did Captain Kang put you up to this?

598
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,914
Or maybe it's because the kids have grown on you...

599
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,015
like Ro Ha did.

600
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,716
It's not exactly that, but...

601
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,955
Keep patrolling, then.

602
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,355
If you see the kids,

603
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,055
make sure they get home safely.

604
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:17,296
I'll leave it to you and be on my way.

605
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:19,425
Sorry?

606
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:22,095
I also patrol the grounds at this time of the day.

607
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,336
There's no way of knowing what can happen to kids.

608
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:29,336
This right here is what I carry around for self-defence.

609
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:33,205
- Keep up the good work. - Have a good day.

610
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,784
You want to ask Ha Yoon directly?

611
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:40,856
That's right.

612
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,526
It seems as though she remembers it quite clearly.

613
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,724
She doesn't know who gave her the banana milk,

614
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,796
but we might get something to go on...

615
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,425
if we ask what she saw.

616
00:38:51,426 --> 00:38:52,994
That idea also crossed my mind,

617
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,296
but I didn't say anything since it could alarm her.

618
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:58,365
We should get her in a comfortable setting...

619
00:38:58,366 --> 00:38:59,906
and then ask in passing.

620
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,736
You and Ha Yoon are quite close.

621
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:09,475
Sure. Is there anything else you want to say?

622
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:11,885
Like what?

623
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:13,855
About your date with Bo Ra's mom...

624
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,815
or about someone else that's been annoying you.

625
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:18,386
It wasn't a date. All we had was a meal together.

626
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,454
Dressed up like that?

627
00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:22,724
What do you mean? This is how I always dress.

628
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:24,966
Sure, of course. Unbelievable.

629
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:30,105
Goodness. If you nap for this long,

630
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,626
you'll have trouble sleeping at night.

631
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:11,645
What the...

632
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:13,545
It's me, Wook.

633
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:15,446
Why were you in there?

634
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:17,586
- Gosh. - Goodness.

635
00:40:18,145 --> 00:40:20,656
I got thirsty and wanted some water.

636
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,486
- Gosh. - No one seemed to be around.

637
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:25,356
I thought I was being robbed.

638
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,725
Why were you this startled?

639
00:40:28,196 --> 00:40:29,625
I thought you were robbing me.

640
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,495
Did you come alone?

641
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,534
Where's Mr. Jang?

642
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:36,236
We were on our way here, but he went to see Mr. Jung.

643
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:39,066
To get Ha Yoon and Young Rim's school records.

644
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,605
I see. Were you out on a date?

645
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:46,574
Seriously? All we had was a meal.

646
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:47,935
Why is everyone calling it a date?

647
00:40:49,816 --> 00:40:50,886
I guess it was a date.

648
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:53,415
I'll get you some water.

649
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,386
Make it barley tea.

650
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,994
Here are ten years' worth...

651
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,495
of Ha Yoon and Young Rim's school records.

652
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:06,124
Eun Hee kept them neat and tidy.

653
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,136
Thank you.

654
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:08,966
I must've made you stay late at work.

655
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:13,406
It's not like I have a wife at home who nags me for being late.

656
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:15,136
- Shall we get going? - Sure thing.

657
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:19,575
Mr. Jung, don't you miss your family?

658
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,116
You never mention them.

659
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,415
I've heard more about my Hyun Ji than about you.

660
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:29,656
Because Hyun Ji was a bright little star.

661
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,696
You remind me of her,

662
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:35,625
and I miss her.

663
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,466
My daughter's lucky to have been loved.

664
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:40,796
Doesn't it surprise you...

665
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:44,235
that the dead make memories together...

666
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,535
and miss one another?

667
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:47,805
I guess it does.

668
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:51,305
Don't you want to leave? You've been here a long time.

669
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:55,276
Want to hear something funny?

670
00:41:56,216 --> 00:42:00,285
The mortality rate here is at zero percent.

671
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:02,816
It's not like we can die twice.

672
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,586
Right.

673
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,394
Anyway, this is me.

674
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:10,395
Shouldn't you have taken off a few steps back?

675
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,495
- What? - I'll see you around.

676
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:15,296
Take care.

677
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:38,156
Look. These shoe prints are bigger than mine.

678
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,125
They must belong to a man.

679
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:03,745
Who's there?

680
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:05,146
I know you're there. Show yourself.

681
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,756
My goodness.

682
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:17,796
What are you doing here?

683
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,125
Oh, I was...

684
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:23,165
doing stuff.

685
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,136
So...

686
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:28,506
There's nothing over there.

687
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:30,475
Why are you coming from that way?

688
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:36,874
I came out for a walk and...

689
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,986
to do some thinking.

690
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:42,015
Hang on.

691
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:44,386
Are those handcuffs?

692
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:49,026
Did something happen back here?

693
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,164
What's taking him so long?

694
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:54,966
Is he filling in the forms himself?

695
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:57,435
Ms. An.

696
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,735
Ha Yoon, she's missing.

697
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:01,804
Ha Yoon?

698
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,974
Yes. She'd gone to see Young Rim,

699
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,445
but when I went to get her,

700
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:07,074
- they said she never came. - When did she leave?

701
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,345
Wait, is Ha Yoon's stuff still here?

702
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:10,784
Yes, they are.

703
00:44:10,785 --> 00:44:13,886
She left before dusk so it was about 5pm.

704
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:17,855
What did you say? Who's missing?

705
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:18,986
Ha Yoon.

706
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:21,355
We must find her fast.

707
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:22,725
It's Choi Young Bae!

708
00:44:23,665 --> 00:44:25,665
- Who? - Choi Young Bae.

709
00:44:31,506 --> 00:44:32,506
Ha Yoon.

710
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:34,705
You're scared, aren't you?

711
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:39,176
I went to get water because you said you were thirsty,

712
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:42,515
but I couldn't get any.

713
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:47,716
I brought you a doll.

714
00:45:00,736 --> 00:45:02,636
I'm pretty sure he came this way.

715
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:04,366
Where'd he go?

716
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:09,034
Il Yong and I'll go to the lake.

717
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:10,874
Detective Ko, call the villagers...

718
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,704
- and search every corner. - Okay.

719
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:14,775
I'll find Mr. Jung and tell him.

720
00:45:14,776 --> 00:45:16,546
- Okay, let's all go. - No, wait.

721
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:19,585
- You stay with Alice. - No, I'll come too.

722
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:22,585
Hye Ju, take Alice and stay with Mr. Jung.

723
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,926
- There's no time to waste. - Let's go.

724
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:35,495
Ha Yoon.

725
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,765
You scoundrel!

726
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:44,705
Darn you.

727
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:51,386
Last time, when Alice went missing,

728
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:55,586
I got so worried about her, I forgot all about Ha Yoon.

729
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:58,985
I should've kept her close.

730
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:00,455
It's not your fault.

731
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,296
Did you hear that?

732
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:16,522
What are you doing?

733
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,592
You...

734
00:46:19,422 --> 00:46:21,862
What do you think you're doing?

735
00:46:31,743 --> 00:46:32,802
Oh, dear.

736
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:41,282
Die!

737
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,723
Are you okay?

738
00:46:48,592 --> 00:46:49,853
Who are you?

739
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:53,092
Ha Yoon. My poor baby.

740
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:55,092
Look at you.

741
00:46:56,263 --> 00:46:58,433
It's okay now. Were you hurt?

742
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,103
You must've been so scared.

743
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,531
Darn it.

744
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:04,002
Hurry up.

745
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:10,671
What made you think of coming here?

746
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:13,242
I followed the footprint we saw last time.

747
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:14,313
The footprint?

748
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:19,382
Still, you shouldn't have come here on your own. It's dangerous.

749
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:20,993
You really...

750
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:22,622
Were you hurt?

751
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,393
I'm fine. I'm more worried about the kid.

752
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:29,532
You should be beaten to death.

753
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:31,433
You scumbag.

754
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:34,933
Oh, dear.

755
00:47:35,273 --> 00:47:37,171
You should take her home.

756
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:39,143
Okay. Can you get up?

757
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:40,913
Come on.

758
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:48,852
What should we do with him?

759
00:47:48,853 --> 00:47:50,782
Make him disappear from this place.

760
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,683
I'll take care of him. Leave it to me.

761
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:57,023
Okay, you sort him out. Do you have your gun?

762
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:04,902
Tie him to a rock and throw it in the lake.

763
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:07,063
Or bury him.

764
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,172
So he never shows himself again.

765
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:11,572
We should've done that 15 years ago.

766
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:16,142
You won't actually do that, will you?

767
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,743
Why can't we?

768
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,953
Death is a luxury to the likes of you!

769
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:23,683
That's very right.

770
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:31,462
Did you hear that?

771
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:34,063
Let go.

772
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:37,802
Darn it.

773
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:42,072
Bring him over here.

774
00:48:43,973 --> 00:48:45,172
Hold tight.

775
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:48,913
- Let go of me. - Keep still.

776
00:48:49,572 --> 00:48:51,212
- Tie him up. - Let me go.

777
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:53,212
Untie me!

778
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,782
- Untie me! - Shut your mouth!

779
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:59,782
The Miranda rule means nothing here.

780
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,352
Punks like you don't deserve rights.

781
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:03,453
Why don't I?

782
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:06,063
I'm here too because I was wrongfully killed!

783
00:49:06,263 --> 00:49:07,393
What?

784
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,572
The people here are different from trash like you.

785
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:18,402
How so?

786
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:20,273
You really don't know?

787
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:24,583
I don't want to spend time chatting with the likes of you,

788
00:49:24,743 --> 00:49:26,413
so just answer my questions.

789
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:30,982
Who killed you?

790
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,252
What?

791
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,922
He came here 15 years ago?

792
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:39,163
Yes.

793
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:41,292
Where was he all this while?

794
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:43,232
I never saw him once.

795
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:46,333
He bothered Ha Yoon so much,

796
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:50,002
Comrade Jung and I left him on an island.

797
00:49:52,203 --> 00:49:54,842
Do not ever think of returning to the mainland.

798
00:49:55,013 --> 00:49:56,772
You brought this upon yourself,

799
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:58,183
so do not blame anyone else.

800
00:49:58,482 --> 00:49:59,743
If you are lucky,

801
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:02,583
one day you will get to disappear.

802
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,123
You can't just leave a person here!

803
00:50:12,063 --> 00:50:14,692
How dare an animal claim to be a person?

804
00:50:14,993 --> 00:50:16,732
No human does what you do!

805
00:50:17,802 --> 00:50:19,933
He is not worth talking to. Leave him.

806
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:29,572
He won't swim back, will he?

807
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,043
He cannot swim.

808
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:34,020
And look at the distance.

809
00:50:34,021 --> 00:50:35,121
You're right.

810
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:37,730
It's quite deep too.

811
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:40,061
He cannot cross this while he is alive. Do not worry.

812
00:50:40,532 --> 00:50:42,362
Can he if he dies, then?

813
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:45,402
Can people here die when they want?

814
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,972
It will not happen,

815
00:50:48,242 --> 00:50:50,500
but if he finds his way back to the village,

816
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,571
I will find another way to exile him.

817
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:53,842
Trust me.

818
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:55,641
Okay.

819
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,652
Comrade Jung.

820
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,651
You need to paddle the other way.

821
00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:02,782
We're supposed to go that way.

822
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:08,922
That's why you left the boat on land.

823
00:51:09,161 --> 00:51:10,561
So what if we did?

824
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:14,032
He's back again and terrorizing the girls.

825
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:17,532
I'm so sick of this place.

826
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:20,802
However hard I try, it's all for nothing.

827
00:51:21,402 --> 00:51:24,141
There's no running away or dying.

828
00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:28,081
Scum like him and the kids are all grouped together.

829
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,411
Aren't we all...

830
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:33,552
just rats in his trap?

831
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:40,152
Captain Kang.

832
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:44,632
It must've been so tough, worrying about this on your own.

833
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:49,061
It wasn't me.

834
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,702
It was Ha Yoon that got hurt.

835
00:51:54,672 --> 00:51:57,500
Oh, boy. I should go out and find Choi Young Bae first.

836
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:59,187
That way, the kids can put their worries to rest.

837
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:01,310
But he died 15 years ago.

838
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:03,140
Do you think you can find him?

839
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:06,711
Come on. We even found Eun Hee, who died 20 years ago.

840
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:08,021
- Right. - Well...

841
00:52:08,782 --> 00:52:10,422
Wook managed to find out some things.

842

Well, that man...

843
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,592
His wife killed him.

844
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:22,361
He kept trying to escape the deserted island.

845
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:25,000
A few days ago, he fell into a deep lake.

846
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:27,321
When he regained consciousness, he came out through there.

847
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:31,411
Does that mean he went all the way to the end and came here?

848
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:34,541
It doesn't matter how he came back. Let's finish him off for good.

849
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:37,080
Find his address, and I'll tail him.

850
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:38,611
I'll see if I can gather some useful info.

851
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:39,882
Okay, sounds good.

852
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:41,222
What can I do?

853
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:43,080
You're busy.

854
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:45,152
You have to watch the store, look after Alice,

855
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:47,250
and make sure the kids get their snacks on time.

856

We'll take care of this. Don't worry about it.

857
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,931
Yes. Detective Ko will make sure he can't go anywhere.

858
00:52:53,932 --> 00:52:56,131
And Mr. Jung will keep the kids safe.

859
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,101
Il Yong and I are here too.

860
00:52:58,271 --> 00:53:01,501
Our situations may be different, but we're comrades too, you see.

861
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:05,041
Working toward the same goal makes us comrades.

862
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:08,480
He's right. I'll fill in for you this time.

863
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:10,411
So please get some rest.

864
00:53:12,211 --> 00:53:14,182
Rest? I haven't even done much.

865
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:16,980
You nearly threw the plant earlier.

866
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:18,421
Wasn't it because of Choi Young Bae?

867
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,460
I knew it.

868
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:23,290
You sure didn't hide your anger...

869
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,691
when you did that.

870
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,661
I'm sorry.

871
00:53:29,202 --> 00:53:32,231
My goodness. Thank you all so much.

872
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:34,301
What are you thanking us for?

873
00:53:34,302 --> 00:53:35,941
Let's go, Wook. We should hurry.

874
00:53:36,402 --> 00:53:38,011
- Okay. - See you.

Bye.

Name, Choi Young Bae. Born in 1963.

877
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,381
Fifteen years ago, he was forty-five.

878
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:49,250
He was never reported missing.

879
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:50,722
No criminal record either.

880
00:53:50,922 --> 00:53:52,491
He has a wife, Cho Yu Sun,

881
00:53:52,492 --> 00:53:55,092
and a daughter, Choi Eun Soo, who is 20 years old.

882
00:53:55,862 --> 00:53:58,060
They've been living in the same apartment for 18 years.

The apartment is in Choi Young Bae's name.

885
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:03,202
They moved into the apartment before Choi Young Bae died,

886
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:05,370
and they're still living there.

887

Yes, I think that's what happened.

888
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,601
What did he do that his wife killed him?

889
00:54:10,802 --> 00:54:12,870
Judging from the things he's done in the village,

890
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:14,580
he's clearly a pervert.

891
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:15,981
That's probably why she killed him.

892
00:54:17,411 --> 00:54:19,182
What does his wife do?

893
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:22,072
She's just an ordinary civilian who's never paid a single fine.

894
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:25,521
She had private healthcare until three months ago through her job.

895

I want to go check out Choi Young Bae's apartment.

906

If he goes in there, he can't get out.

How rude! He flat out ignored me.

Why is he looking for Il Yong in such a rush?

914

Well, it's fine.

Mr. Jang knows everything.

947
00:58:54,592 --> 00:58:56,161
He knows everything?

948
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,262
Yes, I heard everything.

So where is Detective Ko now?

Of course, I just played dumb.

But he didn't believe me.

He said he'd go there and catch him red-handed.

That's why I ran here.

01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,282
I'm not dead.

984
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:48,831
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

985
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:50,762
Who made such a rule?

986
01:01:50,902 --> 01:01:52,330
It's so unfair.

987
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:54,132
Captain Kang knew everything.

988
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:55,940
Please tell me.

989
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:57,370
Have you been hearing from your family all alone...

990
01:01:57,371 --> 01:01:58,491
behind everyone else's back?

991
01:01:58,572 --> 01:02:01,580
I guess no secrets can exist whatsoever in any kind of world.

992
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:04,882
Lee Dong Min was after Detective Shin from the start.

993
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:07,451
Who is it that he's even tracking the location?

994
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:09,921
I feel like being tested.

995
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:11,652
What are those punks scheming?

996
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:14,521
My question is, "Who is that person?"

997
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:16,191
There's someone else behind.
