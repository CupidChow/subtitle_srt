1
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:11,659
(One year ago in Duon Village)

2
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:24,979
Yes, they were here.

3
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,079
Those who could see the dead just like us.

4
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:32,848
They aided us...

5
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,818
by delivering messages to loved ones...

6
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,089
and completing unfinished businesses.

7
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:44,129
Thanks to them, many who resided here...

8
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:46,498
could leave the village.

9
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,269
They were like family.

10
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:54,239
And all I have is gratitude.

11
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,078
I wonder if they're doing well.

12
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,959
(Episode 1)

13
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:39,179
Are you all right?

14
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:05,378
We should go.

15
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,078
Keep an eye on them from afar.

16
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,109
Yes, sir.

17
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:15,119
I doubt he did any drugs.

18
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:17,788
And we all have one or two allergies these days.

19
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,187
If only his condition didn't abruptly worsen...

20
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,288
The patients here...

21
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:24,959
are mostly in severe conditions.

22
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:26,998
Enough with the sobbing.

23
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,528
Here's 10,000 dollars in advance.

24
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,769
You will get the rest after the surgery.

25
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,169
Sir.

26
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,109
Could I get an extra 1,000 dollars?

27
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,347
We're talking about harvesting...

28
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,519
perfectly good organs.

29
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,949
Please be considerate of me...

30
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:50,818
and give me 1,000 dollars more.

31
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,119
Worry about the freshness of the harvested organs.

32
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,128
You might not even get the rest of your payment.

33
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,727
If you run off without doing your part,

34
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,359
it won't end with just a kidney.

35
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:03,968
We all have two kidneys, but you have one life to live...

36
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,739
as does he.

37
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,639
Eat well and exercise every day for an hour.

38
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,649
I hope to see you in mint condition.

39
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,718
- Hello. - Hello.

40
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,489
Can you watch him for me?

41
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:29,628
- Sure. Do what you need to do. - Thank you.

42
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,628
Tell me if you're feeling uncomfortable.

43
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:14,598
Where is he?

44
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,639
Where is he? Darn it.

45
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,108
Sir.

46
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,689
- Go after him! - Yes, sir!

47
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,227
Get him!

48
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:38,259
My gosh!

49
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,167
Get him!

50
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,329
He's going up!

51
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,598
Stop right there!

52
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:49,939
Get him!

53
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,378
Let go of me!

54
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:54,907
I told you to let go. Hold on.

55
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:56,478
Let me go and use your words.

56
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,718
You dared to cross me? Did you?

57
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:06,188
Hey, let's gut this jerk today.

58
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,188
What are you going to do?

59
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,458
We're going to gut you.

60
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,958
Don't you know what that means?

61
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,097
Your liver, heart, spleen,

62
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,198
lungs, and kidneys.

63
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,628
Then your large intestines, small intestines,

64
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,928
stomach, and gall bladder. We'll take it all.

65
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,139
We're going to sell what makes money and throw the rest out.

66
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:23,537
- Drag him out. - Wait, hold on!

67
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,967
You're making a mistake today.

68
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,839
- Let go and talk to me. - Hey, Kim Seok Hoon!

69
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:32,548
Hey, Detective Shin.

70
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:35,689
- What brings you here? - What do you think?

71
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:38,048
The police are here to catch a conman, you punk.

72
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,089
You punks.

73
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,287
Kim Seok Hoon.

74
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,329
You're under arrest for habitual fraud.

75
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,259
What?

76
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,269
Were you conned by this guy too?

77
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,399
That's great.

78
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,998
Come with us to the station as a testifier.

79
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,367
What do you mean by testifier? He's a criminal.

80
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:56,938
He was just threatening me...

81
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,309
- and saying he was going to gut me. - Threatening you?

82
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:02,948
It's not true. We were never conned.

83
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,579
We were just about to be,

84
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:07,649
but you came and saved us.

85
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:09,519
Then we'll get going.

86
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,519
Let's go, friends.

87
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,888
Hey, you punk!

88
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,189
- Hey! - Goodbye.

89
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:18,598
Hey.

90
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:24,167
You're always a step late, but you were on time today.

91
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,769
What have you been up to?

92
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:27,538
Those punks...

93
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,168
conned Soo Hyuk's mom about an organ transplant, so I...

94
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:34,509
By the way, how are you back here?

95
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,808
Lee Jong A called me.

96
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:37,908
My gosh.

97
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,048
I knew it.

98
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:25,089
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

99
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,439
My gosh. I almost died.

100
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,108
I only survived because Detective Shin showed up.

101
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,878
We were waiting for you, but you never showed up.

102
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,578
So Ms. Lee called him.

103
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:41,579
What?

104
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,177
But he showed up way too fast for that.

105
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,078
To be honest, I called him in advance.

106
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,019
I created a Plan B in preparation for an unexpected situation.

107
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:51,787
You're the best, Ms. Lee.

108
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,718
You know how thorough and meticulous I am.

109
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:56,228
Which brings me to...

110
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,259
You know tomorrow's rent day. Right?

111
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:02,199
Wook.

112
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,269
You were a week late last month, so I paid your portion.

113
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,439
What did you say when you moved in here?

114
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,208
You said the three of us would split rent...

115
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,078
and the living space. That's the promise you made.

116
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,209
If you agreed to share, you should share.

117
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:16,977
If you keep acting like this,

118
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,748
I can't share with you anymore.

119
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,048
We're going to pay you, of course.

120
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,718
Do we look like the people who would skip out on rent?

121
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:26,758
Excuse me.

122
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:30,929
I'm going to go to my room first.

123
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:33,727
My gosh.

124
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:36,329
Goodness. It's been a while since I ran. My legs hurt.

125
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,098
Goodness.

126
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,508
Thank you for your business.

127
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,409
I feel sorry for Jjonga,

128
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,248
but this is the last time. So let's be cool.

129
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:10,898
The bone marrow donor...

130
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,839
went off the grid without telling us,

131
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:19,108
so I went all the way there out of desperation.

132
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,107
Even still,

133
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:24,248
black market organ transplants are illegal.

134
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,518
On top of that, they just took your money and ran.

135
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:31,049
Here.

136
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:33,218
This is the 10,000 dollars you got conned out of.

137
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:35,589
Thank you.

138
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:41,098
Help pay for the hospital with this.

139
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,968
You said you were behind on Soo Hyuk's hospital bills.

140
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,538
How could I accept this?

141
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,669
What do you mean? Just take it.

142
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,608
I withdrew my savings today, and I have nothing to spend it on.

143
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,949
Plus, it's not like Soo Hyuk and I are strangers.

144
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:04,888
I've seen him in the market since he was in diapers.

145
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,589
- Even still... - I'm not giving it to you for free.

146
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,159
Pay me back when you get the money.

147
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,699
I'll get going.

148
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,017
Did you go there again?

149
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,919
I just stopped by on my way home.

150
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,988
I was hoping to find some traces of them being home.

151
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:40,118
Hey. You punk.

152
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,329
How incompetent does a detective have to be...

153
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:45,387
to be unable to find a missing person for three months...

154
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,398
and just continue visiting an empty house?

155
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:49,598
I feel like I've heard this before.

156
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:53,669
That's what you said to me two years ago.

157
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,938
Don't wander around by yourself,

158
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:57,908
and hurry up and go home.

159
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,108
Yes, sir.

160
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,388
It's been unlocked all this time.

161
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:14,388
Is anyone home?

162
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:15,858
Excuse me?

163
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,998
Be quiet if you don't want to die.

164
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,637
Do you want to die?

165
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:27,768
Darn it.

Hey.

Goodness.

Are you okay?

What happened?

176
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:36,238
That's what I want to ask.

177
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,309
You were passed out in the yard of that house.

178
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,439
You're the one who called 911.

179

- Look. - I did?

180
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:44,808
I don't remember.

181
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:45,919
Take a look.

182
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,089
Do you remember who hit you?

183
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,387
No.

184
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:55,987
The police dispatched to the scene think it was a break in.

185
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,958
They said they took anything that was worth money.

186

- Did they find any witnesses? - Not yet.

What do you mean I don't have any credit?

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,727
I have paid all my taxes...

Take a look. I'm a regular client at this bank.

199
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:38,867
There aren't related documents...

200
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,767
that can verify your income or tax retention.

201
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,569
I'm afraid I can't authorize a loan.

202
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,768
Your income must be verified.

203
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,738
How can one do that though?

204
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:49,548
My bank account shows monthly payments...

205
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:51,209
that are a form of regular income.

206

This isn't enough, sir.

Could you put up anything as collateral?

208

Maybe you have a house or a building.

Here.

Is this 120 dollars?

What? I see you did better.

212

Unbelievable.

You know,

you're even poorer than I am despite being decent-looking.

She might really kick us out at this rate.

You were right.

We can't continue this way.

We have a monthly rent to pay,

and we need to save up for a life after retirement.

We can't carry on taking jobs that don't pay.

221

It's not like anyone acknowledges the good work we do.

Exactly.

Everyone in Duon Village was found,

so maybe I should get myself a job.

225
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:04,018
An employee of mine reached out to tell me...

226
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,858
about the factory he opened. I should pay him a visit.

227

That's good news.

228
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:10,358
Could he have room for one more?

229

I'm going to get a new job...

230

and surprise Jong A by excelling at it.

From this moment on,

232
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:22,168
I will not bat an eye to those in need.

- Sure. - Just wait and see.

I'm only going to look out for myself.

Sure, I'll wait and see.

I'm off to the restroom.

Coffee makes me go all the time.

238
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,089
Yes, prosecutor.

239
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,819
I followed your instructions and placed it there.

240
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:41,789
Right.

241

I'm waiting for you at the café. Please hurry.

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,529
Sure.

What kinds of scoundrels steal other people's bank accounts?

244

That's highly suspicious.

If you agreed to share, you should share.

If you keep acting like this, I can't share with you anymore.

Ma'am, that's not it.

248
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,727
But that's what the prosecutor said.

249
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:18,857
Those rats used my money to scam people.

250
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,857
And I'm telling you that the prosecutor is conning you.

251
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,468
Why would a prosecutor con me?

252
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:28,238
It isn't a prosecutor who is conning you.

253
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,669
That con artist is pretending to be a prosecutor.

Who had you withdraw your money?

257
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:40,179
I'll capture him myself and confirm what I'm saying is true.

258
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:43,319
He said he'd be here shortly.

259
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:46,858
If he sent one of his goons,

260
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,229
he should be around here.

261
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,789
He just bailed.

262
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,759
Who? The one who just ran off?

263

Your mom hasn't been home for two days,

Has your mother done anything like this before?

That her mom works at a restaurant?

She does not.

It's obvious.

She wears crazy makeup and short skirts and comes home at dawn.

As if she works at a restaurant.

She must work at some bar.

As if that's a big deal.

She often left for 3, even 4 days.

00:40:58,658 --> 00:40:59,888
Her life is in danger.

660
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:03,698
Then you should call the police.

661
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:07,566
By the way, how can I trust you...

662
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,738
My name is Oh Il Yong,

663
00:41:09,797 --> 00:41:11,868
and I died 3 years ago at the age of 24.

664
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:13,607
Go and check.

665
00:41:15,107 --> 00:41:17,247
You don't have to believe in what I say.

666
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,777
In return, that woman will die.

667
00:41:21,118 --> 00:41:22,547
Then I'll report it to the police.

668
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,218
I have nothing to lose.

669
00:41:24,687 --> 00:41:27,388
It wouldn't be the first time they said I was crazy because of this.

670
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,857
So where is that woman?

671
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,027
Is she in the warehouse?

672
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,727
I don't know if she's still there.

673
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,457
I came to tell you this.

674
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,397
Hey, you can't just leave!

675
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:40,768
She's not the only Choi Jung A in Korea!

676
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:42,397
Look here. Mr. Oh!

677
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:43,868
Darn it.

678
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:46,538
Mr. Oh!

679
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:57,147
- Pan Seok. - Yes?

680
00:41:58,547 --> 00:41:59,687
They're back.

681
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:01,758
I can see them again.

682
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:06,227
What are you saying? You don't make any sense.

683
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:08,797
- What do you see? - The dead.

684
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:11,598
Dead people.

685
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:18,038
The sponsors gave you this too?

686
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,837
They gave you this as a prize?

687
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,678
The award for the Brave Citizen Award is a car?

688
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,776
That's not what's important here.

689
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,247
How long did you know?

690
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:30,687
When did you find out he was dead and how?

691
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,717
I found out on my way back from the restroom...

692
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,457
at the coffee shop that day.

693
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:37,357
He didn't go through the front door.

694
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,457
He just walked through the window.

695
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:43,198
He just walked through our front gate too.

696
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:45,268
Why didn't you say anything?

697
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:47,968
I did.

698
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:50,066
I asked you if you saw anything strange,

699
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,768
suspicious, or weird.

700
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,836
How is that telling me?

701
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:57,007
You should've told me he was dead.

702
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,376
Why couldn't you tell me?

703
00:42:58,377 --> 00:43:00,647
"This guy is dead. I saw it!"

704
00:43:01,817 --> 00:43:03,578
You're so sketchy.

705
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:06,746
Back then at Duon Village, you saw everything,

706
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:07,957
but you pretended not to.

707
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,726
My gosh. I thought you didn't see him.

708
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:13,158
What's so good about that?

709
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:14,357
In any case,

710
00:43:15,127 --> 00:43:18,297
this means you and I can see ghosts again.

711
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:20,698
There's something else.

712
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:23,198
Jjamppong sees him too.

713
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:28,308
Gosh. Is seeing ghosts hereditary?

714
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:33,047
Where are we going right now?

715
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,817
Oh, gosh. Did you see something?

716
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,457
- What's going on? - Be quiet.

717
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:47,288
Hey.

718
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:50,457
Hey, there.

719
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:09,277
Gosh.

720
00:44:10,788 --> 00:44:13,586
Oh, Detective Shin. It's been a while.

721
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:15,317
- Have you been well? - Yes.

722
00:44:16,817 --> 00:44:18,686
By the way, a woman in a wedding dress was kidnapped?

723
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:20,328
What is this about?

724
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:23,627
I'm sure she was seen here.

725
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:27,368
Detective Shin. Did you find the car that time?

726
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:30,937
The license plate you told me last time was fake.

727
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:33,637
And the woman named Choi Jung A has never been reported missing.

728
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,276
I asked the Criminal Affairs Division too.

729
00:44:35,277 --> 00:44:36,808
Who reported this case?

730
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,206
That doesn't matter.

731
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:41,917
What matters is that there is a witness.

732
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:49,617
Did a dead person show up and tell you about it, perhaps?

733
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:50,957
This isn't one of those situations again, is it?

734
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:56,257
What? Is that it?

735
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:58,868
I don't know.

736
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:01,198
I don't know anything.

737
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,308
It is. Yes.

738
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:12,277
A dead man named Oh Il Yong came in through my front door...

739
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,547
and said that the man caught at the café died.

740
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:16,746
And inside the car belonging to the guys who killed him,

741
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,618
a woman named Choi Jung A was being held against her will.

742
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:20,647
That's what he said.

743
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,686
Gosh, so it really was a ghost who told you.

744
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:25,726
My goodness.

745
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:27,227
You don't seem surprised, Detective Shin.

746
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,227
I was so surprised by that.

747
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,098
It's not the first time. Why would I be surprised now?

748
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:32,727
I guess you can see them again.

749
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:38,408
Anyway, the voice phishing scammer that you caught, An Sung Jun.

750
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,837
- He really is dead. - What?

751
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,476
He was stabbed by a knife,

752
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:45,206
but there weren't any security cameras or witnesses nearby.

753
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:46,808
What do you mean there weren't any witnesses?

754
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:48,447
Oh Il Yong says he saw it.

755
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:51,417
You can just catch him first. That Oh Il Yong fellow.

756
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:54,317
The guy that Wook saw.

757
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,158
Oh, yes.

758
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,988
Then you can just look for Oh Il Yong first.

759
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:01,557
He died three years ago,

760
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,127
and I think he was 24 years old at the time.

761
00:46:05,368 --> 00:46:07,567
I will look into it, but...

762
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:09,867
Calling me out because of a report made by...

763
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,436
such an uncertain reporter,

764
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:15,037
and especially someone who's dead, puts me in a tight spot.

765
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,177
You're not the only one in a tight spot. So am I.

766
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:20,077
I want to say the same thing.

767
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,717
I don't want to be involved with dead people either.

768
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:24,247
I'm busy, so I'll get going first.

769
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:25,586
Okay.

770

Gosh, the witness is a ghost.

771
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,687
Seriously...

772
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:33,627
Hey, how could you be so mean?

773
00:46:33,828 --> 00:46:35,796
You could just tell him what you saw.

774
00:46:35,797 --> 00:46:37,328
Why are you making me look like a crazy person?

775
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,467
Are you sure you won't get more involved?

776
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:41,497
Il Yong, Sam Yong, or whatever his name is will be back.

777
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:48,678
Here.

778
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:55,578

We are looking for her,

00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,988
but there's more stuff we need to investigate.

782
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:07,488
My mom...

783
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:10,328
doesn't work at a restaurant, does she?

784
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:12,768
What?

785
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,408
She told me she was working at a restaurant,

786
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:28,817
but she smelled like alcohol when she came home late at night.

787
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,087
So I did suspect that might not be true.

821
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:39,747
From what I hear, there's a bunch of people who lent her money.

822
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:40,948
Hey, Jong A.

823
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:43,376
Shall we order just two more bottles of beer?

824
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:45,417
But where did Jung A spend that money?

825
00:49:45,848 --> 00:49:47,218
I don't know.

826
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:49,487
But there were bad rumours about her.

827
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:51,626
She even collapsed after taking sleeping pills once.

828
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,527
I heard she was working at a bar too.

829
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:55,057
Hey, Jong A.

830
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,297
Shall we order just one more bottle of beer?

831
00:49:58,598 --> 00:50:00,667
She worked so hard to save up that money to move out.

832
00:50:02,497 --> 00:50:03,868
Hey, Byun Seul Gi. Wake up.

833
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,307
Hey, wake up! We should go find your money.

834
00:50:06,308 --> 00:50:07,538
Hey, hurry and wake her up.

835
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,207
Hey. Seul Gi.

836
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:12,247
Wake up. Are you okay?

837
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,817
- Jong A. Then what about the beers? - Gosh, seriously?

838
00:50:18,647 --> 00:50:19,848
Come to your senses!

839
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:24,828
Is she sleeping?

840
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:27,388
She must think this is her own bedroom.

841
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,557
Mister, that's not important right now.

842
00:50:29,558 --> 00:50:31,097
You know Jung A too, don't you?

843
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:33,566
Please find her. Choi Jung A.

844
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:34,637
Gosh.

845
00:50:34,638 --> 00:50:36,137
Hey, don't even get me started.

846
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:37,967
I went to her wedding yesterday,

847
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,066
but her mom passed out. I couldn't even eat a meal...

848
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:41,637
and had to take her to the emergency room.

849
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:42,876
I know.

850
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:45,706
A bride disappeared on her wedding day. We have to find her.

851
00:50:45,707 --> 00:50:48,447
She was fine when she put on her makeup and wedding dress.

852
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:51,287
She said she'd pay off the balance with the monetary gifts she got.

853
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:52,988
But then, she vanished into thin air.

854
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,117
Anyway, it's not the police's duty...

855
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,457
to find someone who disappeared because of money issues.

856
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,087
You should just sue her instead.

857
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,697
- What? - Then her case would get filed.

858
00:51:02,698 --> 00:51:03,927
Gosh, uncle.

859
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:06,666
Still, we can't sue a friend of ours.

860
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:07,797
Then what else can you do?

861
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:11,837
Darn it.

862
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:20,747
You said you were through with this.

863
00:51:21,518 --> 00:51:23,118
Why did you come back here?

864
00:51:23,777 --> 00:51:27,087
That's why I came. I should say goodbye if I can see them.

865
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,638
Pan Seok. Can you see it?

866
00:51:48,977 --> 00:51:50,337
What? No.

867
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:52,908
I can't see Duon Village,

868
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:55,017
so why do you think I can see Oh Il Yong?

869
00:51:55,018 --> 00:51:56,247
I'm not sure.

870
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:59,018
He must be holding onto some big grudge.

871
00:51:59,147 --> 00:52:00,488
That's his business.

872
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:02,488
What about you and me?

873
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:05,757
It's not like Oh Il Yong has a grudge against us.

874
00:52:05,758 --> 00:52:08,627
You said you wanted to say goodbye. What are you so curious about?

875
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:12,527
Gosh. Let's go.

876
00:52:19,008 --> 00:52:20,206
What are you doing?

877
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:22,808
We came all the way here. We should at least say hi.

878
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:26,147
We might not see them, but they can probably see us over there.

879
00:52:26,508 --> 00:52:27,578
My goodness.

880
00:52:28,877 --> 00:52:30,747
It's not that way.

881
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:33,348
It's this way.

882
00:52:33,747 --> 00:52:35,517
Wook, I lived here for ten years.

883
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:38,428
Then you say hi to that side. I'll say hi to this side.

884
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:40,827
There you go again with your stubborn attitude.

885
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:42,126
Just say hi to that side.

886
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:43,296
- We can each say hi. - Why are you so stubborn?

887
00:52:43,297 --> 00:52:45,428
- It's this way. I lived here... - I'm telling you, it's this way.

888
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:46,967
I lived here for ten...

889
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:47,996
Gosh.

890
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:50,666
You lived here for ten years, but you still don't know.

891
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,868
There's nothing there, Wook.

892
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:55,106
Please let me see him.

893
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:56,407
You should go now.

894
00:52:56,408 --> 00:52:58,578
Dr. Park is in surgery now.

895
00:52:59,848 --> 00:53:01,206
I can't leave like this.

896
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:03,317
Please let me see Dr. Park.

897
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:10,658
What's going on?

898
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:14,428
Dr. Park.

899
00:53:14,627 --> 00:53:17,327
It's me. Eun Hee's mom.

900
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:18,468
Leave her be.

901
00:53:20,368 --> 00:53:23,138
You know where my Eun Hee is, don't you?

902
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,808
Just tell me that and I'll never come back here again.

903
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:27,907
Please, just tell me where my Eun Hee is.

904
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:31,606
I was prepping for surgery, and I have to go back inside.

905
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,907
I'll call you when I'm done.

906
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:34,107
I don't believe you!

907
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:35,577
I won't just leave today.

908
00:53:35,578 --> 00:53:37,646
You said you'd call last time and you didn't.

909
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,087
You ignore my calls...

910
00:53:39,288 --> 00:53:41,417
and won't talk to me even if I visit you at home.

911
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:43,887
This time you even reported me to court.

912
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,428
I will call you this time.

913
00:53:45,758 --> 00:53:46,828
Doctor Park.

914
00:53:46,988 --> 00:53:48,328
Did someone call us?

915
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:54,098
What can we do?

916
00:53:58,937 --> 00:54:00,607
Can you drive any faster?

917
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,538
We're almost there.

918
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:05,848
If you think about it, you're a huge softie too.

919
00:54:06,178 --> 00:54:07,678
You said you'd find a new job.

920
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:10,578
That's rich, coming from you. What about you, then?

921
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:15,518
What's that lady doing there anyway?

922
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:18,428
The hospital director used to date Eun Hee.

923
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:19,686
He lived abroad for years...

924
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:21,257
and recently returned to open a clinic.

925
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,497
He's refusing to see Eun Hee's mom.

926
00:54:22,828 --> 00:54:24,497
You said she got served papers.

927
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,066
If you go against a restraining order,

928
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,768
she could end up getting arrested.

929
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:31,408
She can't just barge in there.

930
00:54:31,508 --> 00:54:33,507
She should find a legal route.

931
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:35,877
How frustrated do you think she is to do that?

932
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:39,177
I wish we could go a little faster.

933
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:40,547
Can you stop whining?

934
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:46,546
I don't believe you anymore!

935
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:48,788
- It's nothing. A misunderstanding? - Ms. Kim.

936
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,018
How is it nothing?

937
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:51,387
Jung Sik said...

938
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,558
that you know where Eun Hee is.

939
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:56,557
Where is my daughter?

940
00:54:56,558 --> 00:54:57,996
Calm down, ma'am.

941
00:54:57,997 --> 00:55:00,468
Let go of me!

942
00:55:00,627 --> 00:55:03,797
I hope you don't give her too hard a time for this.

943
00:55:05,808 --> 00:55:07,738
Where is my daughter?

944
00:55:11,777 --> 00:55:13,308
Ms. Kim.

945
00:55:14,207 --> 00:55:15,317
He knows...

946
00:55:15,948 --> 00:55:18,546
where my Eun Hee is,

947
00:55:18,547 --> 00:55:20,187
but he won't tell me.

948
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:22,258
Okay.

949
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:24,387
Now get up.

950
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:25,828
I'll take you home.

951
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:31,868
On the way here,

952
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:34,837
my heart beat out of my chest.

953
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,468
I didn't know who else to call.

954
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:42,876
I'm sorry.

955
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:45,277
No, you needn't apologize to me.

956
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:48,277
Let's clean this up, shall we?

957
00:55:51,988 --> 00:55:53,416
(Help find Yang Eun Hee)

958
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,888
- I know. - My gosh!

959
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:58,558
What are you doing here?

960
00:55:59,488 --> 00:56:02,158
Forget it. Don't say a word. I won't get involved with you.

961
00:56:03,797 --> 00:56:04,997
That lady's daughter.

962
00:56:05,997 --> 00:56:07,227
I know where she is.

963
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,069
I'm a detective.

964
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:18,969
Thank you.

965
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:32,448
Do we have an ID?

966
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:34,949
Yes. Her name is Choi Jung A. She's 29 years old.

967
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,520
A woman in a wedding dress was taken. Her name's Choi Jung A.

968
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,460
Find her for me.

969
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,770
Say that again. What do you know?

970
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,339
That lady's daughter.

971
00:56:58,239 --> 00:56:59,479
I know where she is.

972
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,378
She went missing 20 years ago.

973
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:02,379
I know that.

974
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,020
Don't you lie. I don't believe you.

975
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,249
The abducted woman in a wedding dress.

976
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,849
I went to the warehouse you mentioned.

977
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,850
She wasn't there.

978
00:57:10,851 --> 00:57:12,689
The license plate? It was fake.

979
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,919
- I... - I even went to Duon Village.

980
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,359
