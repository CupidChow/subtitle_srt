(Lee Tae Hyun)

172
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:21,715
We received a report that Min Seung Jae was getting beaten up.

173
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:23,945
- At my house? - Yes.

174
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:25,815
Who reported it?

175
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,425
That we can't tell you.

176
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,224
Was it Ye Won, by any chance?

177
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,425
- Do you know her? - Yes.

178
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,894
We often volunteer to help out runaway kids.

179
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,264
Ye Won said she had nowhere to go,

180
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:43,835
so we let her stay with us for a few days and gave her some money.

181
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:47,374
You met her too. The girl with long hair and big eyes.

182
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:50,644
Oh, yes. I remember.

183
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,244
But why would she do such a thing?

184
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:54,614
No idea. She suddenly took off without a word.

185
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,744
We haven't seen her for about a month.

186
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,185
Oh, is that right?

187
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,085
Anyway, thank you for your cooperation.

188
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:04,624
No problem. It's getting late, so I hope you can take it easy.

189
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:05,624
Thank you.

Hey, Seul Gi. It's me.

192
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,705
Have you heard from Jung A?

193
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:23,144
What did the substation chief say?

194
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:24,845
He said he didn't know anything.

195
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,474
They don't even have a suspect yet.

196
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,144
This is not good.

197
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:29,585
Hey, what time will you be done today?

198
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,244
Let's call Geun Hyoung too.

199
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,754
Why? What are we going to do?

200
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:36,154
If we track down the cars that were around the wedding shop...

201
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,724
on the day Jung A died and comb through...

202
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,195
the dashcam footage, we might find something.

203
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,295
You're right.

204
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,124
Okay, then I'll leave at 5pm on the dot.

205
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,994
Okay. I'll call you later.

206
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:45,065
All right.

207
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,035
They're doing that again.

208
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:55,974
Wook!

209
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,004
Wook, come out for a second!

210
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,754
Oh, boy. I'm exhausted.

211
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:12,925
Look, over there.

212
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:15,965
There's nothing, but they're so excited for some reason.

213
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,994
It's so weird.

214
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,435
Someone's there, right?

215
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,565
Mr. Oh Il Yong? Are you there?

216
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,435
What do you mean someone's there?

217
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,734
There's no one.

218
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:33,014
Can you take them out for a walk since you came out anyway?

219
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,215
Hey, it's your turn today.

220
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,614
I'm busy today.

221
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,285
I'm meeting up with my friends to find out who kidnapped Jung A.

222
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,315
I must take matters into my own hands.

223
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:43,384
- Where's Pan Seok? - He went hiking.

224
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:48,695
Why is everyone such a busy bee?

225
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,795
You're lazy.

226

Hey, it's...

227
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:00,474
It's still so early. What are you doing here?

228
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,274
You said she knew everything too.

229
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:04,874
Why did you lie to her?

230
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:06,445
What's the point of telling her?

231
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,114
Jjonga can't see you anyway.

232
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,884
She'll just be more frustrated and scared.

233
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:12,185
Anyway, why are you here?

234
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,154
Are you keeping tabs on me?

235
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:17,185
Me?

236
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:21,295
Captain Kang wants to see you and Pan Seok.

237
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,224
Captain Kang? Why?

238
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:28,904
Il Yong is never straightforward with anything.

239
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:30,705
That's why I'm suspicious of him.

240
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,104
Don't you think it's odd?

241
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,274
Well...

242
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:36,305
Try putting yourself in his shoes. How could he trust us?

243
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:40,575
You see, that's your problem.

244
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:42,545
Why are you so understanding of the dead?

245
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,055
Okay. Where's his sister now?

246
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,425
All right. I'll send my team over right away.

Last night, a middle school girl came in and said her brother...

251
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,935
was getting beaten up, but they didn't find him.

252
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:00,764
They thought she was lying,

253
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:03,604
but he didn't come to school today. He's not at home either.

254
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,004
Where are their parents?

255
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,904
They don't have a mother. Their father is abroad now.

256

She's at a shelter now.

I'll go get some rice for you. One moment.

- It's a feast. - Why did she make so much food?

264
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:27,695
Oh, it's nothing.

No. I called you here so we can have some food together.

Oh, it's good. It's really tasty.

Seung Jae, where did you say your sister was now?

I'm so forgetful. I keep forgetting things.

I saw her leave home.

282

But I'm not sure.

283
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,944
I really hope she doesn't get caught again.

What?

285

Get caught? Where?

Hey, take a seat. Come here.

Sit here and tell us.

His sister ran away from home...

and got kidnapped by some bad people.

But he got beaten up and passed out.

00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:50,424
No.

331
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:53,295
The police looked around but didn't see him.

332
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:55,565
If he got away,

333
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,634
he'd have gone home.

334
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:00,634
He...

335
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:03,805
He's smart, so he does well in school.

336
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:06,845
He's not like me. He doesn't just disappear.

337
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:12,045
We'll look for him.

338
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:14,255
Don't worry too much and stay here.

339
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,755
Your dad is taking the first flight back.

340
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:21,424
Do you know of any place Seung Jae often goes to?

341
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:25,725
I don't. We're not close.

342
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,335
I shouldn't have contacted him.

343
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:31,364
It's my fault.

344
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,775
I'm glad, though.

345
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,985
That I'm here and not Ye Won.

346
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:52,354
If something had happened to her instead of me,

347
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:56,525
I don't think I could survive that.

348
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,164
I should go.

349
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,275
Okay. Go ahead.

350
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:12,845
- Go on. - Goodbye.

351
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,444
Bye.

352
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:26,194
We should find Ye Won first.

353
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:30,624
Can you find anyone if you have a name?

354
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:33,335
Yes. Everything's on the internet these days.

355
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:36,904
Do you think his sister got taken again?

356
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:40,174
The world is a scary place, and I'm so worried.

357
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,745
Hey, Wook.

358
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,575
We should get up. Let's go and find her.

359
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,184
You won't finish your meal first?

360
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:51,914
- Why? - Just do it.

361
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,914
Do as the elder says.

362
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,325
Okay, then.

363
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,795
Go ahead. If you want.

364
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,364
Goodness...

365
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,934
I can't do this anymore.

366
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:14,535
I was hoping to...

367
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:17,874
talk my way out of it if I could.

368
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:20,114
This isn't right.

369
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,684
This is why I asked to see you.

370
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:27,015
I felt so sorry for poor Seung Jae.

371
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:29,354
I wanted to ask for your help.

372
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,924
You two helped find Eun Hee.

373
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:36,464
Didn't you?

374
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,664
There's no duping her.

375
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:43,364
It was a bit obvious.

376
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,975
I bet she left before she knew it.

377
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:49,005
But I want to thank you instead.

378
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,275
Don't thank us.

379
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:53,745
Now that you know, I might as well tell you not to get your hopes up.

380
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:55,714
We'll do our best,

381
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,644
but finding missing people isn't as easy as you think or...

382
00:23:58,644 --> 00:23:59,854
That's enough for me.

383
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,684
I'm grateful you'll just listen.

384
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:05,424
What more could I ask for if you'll even go out there to look?

385
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:09,255
We should've asked for more details, then.

386
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,765
Like what the murder weapon was.

387
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:14,995
Do you need more than the culprit's name?

388
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:17,805
Do you think he'd admit to it?

389
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:20,075
We need to corner him with irrefutable evidence.

390
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,674
"Irrefutable?" What's that?

391
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:24,475
What he means is...

392
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:27,475
we need to show something the culprit can't deny.

393
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:29,985
- Oh. - What explanation is that?

394
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:35,884
Leave the food we didn't finish.

395
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:37,785
- I'll eat it up next time. - Okay.

396
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:42,694
Okay. I'll set out enough food to break the table.

397
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:43,795
Don't be too long.

398
00:24:44,364 --> 00:24:46,894
Where's Il Yong?

399
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:49,095
What part-timer is never around?

400
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:50,735
Oh, Il Yong?

401
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:55,204
(Byun Seok Ha, Yeonghyeon-ro 103-6)

402
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,364
Hello.

403
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:21,434
I'm Shin Jun Ho with the Missing Persons Squad.

404
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,235
May we come in?

405
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:27,174
Do excuse us.

406
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:34,275
Are you going traveling?

407
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,714
Yes, on a golfing trip to Thailand.

408
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:40,914
You're packing enough for an emigration.

409
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,025
I'm taking a lot of clothes.

410
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,654
Shall I show you?

411
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,154
I'd appreciate it.

412
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,964
Do you know Min Seung Jae? Min Ye Won's older brother.

413
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,235
He was here last night.

414
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:01,835
Not that again.

415
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,845
We don't know anything.

416
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,944
Ye Won's known to lie as much as she speaks.

417
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:10,614
Can I zip up the suitcase?

418
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:13,154
Joo Yeon, that's enough.

419
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,354
You searched the place yesterday. Why do this again today?

420
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:20,995
Bring a warrant next time.

421
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,164
Yes, we'll bring a warrant. Don't go too far.

422
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:28,295
Or try to run away.

423
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:31,704
We're experts at finding people.

424
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,275
- Right, Detective Oh? - Right.

425
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:35,404
- Let's go. - Okay.

426
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:53,154
I need to take this.

427
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:54,654
- I'll wait in the car. - Okay.

428
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:56,624
Shin Jun Ho speaking.

429
00:26:56,624 --> 00:27:00,394
Detective Shin. Did anyone report Min Ye Won missing?

430
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:01,434
Min Ye Won?

431
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:04,505
Yes. She's 14 years old, and her brother is Min Seung Jae.

432
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:05,904
It's urgent.

433
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:10,005
I'm looking for Min Seung Jae.

434
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,604
What are you on about?

435
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,045
Where did you hear about that?

436
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:16,815
Min Seung Jae is dead.

437
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,614
Seung Jae is dead?

438
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,384
His sister might be in danger too.

439
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:23,684
Ye Won is somewhere safe.

440
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,525
That's a huge relief, then.

441
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:29,194
Detective Shin, you believe me, don't you?

442
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,525
If you do,

443
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:33,464
bring in the people Ye Won was with.

444
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:35,394
They killed Seung Jae.

445
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:40,575
This isn't about whether I believe you or not.

446
00:27:40,674 --> 00:27:41,805
We need proof,

447
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:44,204
and we don't have that yet.

448
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,904
You must bring them in now.

449
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:47,275
If they run away somewhere,

450
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:49,245
we'll never find out where they left Seung Jae.

451
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:51,414
I can't take your word for it and bring them in.

452
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,085
It's not that simple.

453
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:55,684
What are you talking about? They killed a kid!

454
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:03,424
If you can't do anything, we'll go and get them.

455
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:04,725
We'll get them first,

456
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,394
then get Seung Jae to help us find the proof.

457
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:11,134
I'll see what I can do about it. Don't get into any trouble.

458
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:31,184
If they moved the body and evidence right away,

459
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:33,255
we have no time.

460
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:40,295
Detective Shin.

461
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:42,565
Can you put a travel ban on Lee Tae Hyun?

462
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:47,704
I have a feeling Min Seung Jae is dead.

463
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:05,884
Yes? What is it?

464
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:08,595
When on earth will they come out?

465
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:10,795
Wait patiently.

466
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:14,434
Oh, here they come.

467
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:19,335
Courier.

468
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:21,674
What's taking so long?

469
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:32,114
They went downstairs.

470
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:36,924
Okay. It's my turn now.

471
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:38,924
They're dead meat.

472
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,545
Darn it. Are you kidding me?

473
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:57,845
Go talk to him.

474
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:01,585
Hey, old man. Move if you want to live longer!

475
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:08,595
That darn old geezer.

476
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:17,865
Hey, old man. Are you deaf?

477
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:20,206
Move out of the way, darn it!

478
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:23,746
Sorry about that.

479
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,045
Gosh.

480
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:45,726
It's hot enough outside without you annoying me!

481
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,666
Darn it.

482
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,776
- My back. - What is he doing?

483
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,176
Hey, you!

484
00:30:55,176 --> 00:30:57,145
That's not how you should treat your elders.

485
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:59,676
Sir, are you all right?

486
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:01,575
- My back... - Goodness, is it serious?

487
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:03,246
Gosh, this is bad.

488
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,115
Are you out of your mind?

489
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,516
Who are you to barge in?

490
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,355
You are a dangerous young man.

491
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:10,785
Just get back to your delivery route.

492
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,686
You'll learn a lesson today.

493
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:14,156
Here.

494
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:16,795
Hello, is this the police?

495
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:18,895
- I... - Why you...

496
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:20,966
Get your hands off me.

497
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,736
- I'm at 95 Eunsa-ro. - Darn it.

498
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:24,835
An old man was assaulted and is severely injured.

499
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:26,335
Please come quick. Thanks.

500
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:30,075
Goodness.

501
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:31,776
Sir, are you all right?

502
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,645
- You, courier boy. - How can they do that?

503
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:35,815
You. Get your motorcycle out of the way.

504
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:37,585
No way.

505
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:39,385
I'll do so when the police get here.

506
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:41,456
Tae Hyun, let's take another road. We don't want to miss our flight.

507
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,885
- Right. Get in the car. - Move your motorcycle.

508
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,085
Move it!

509
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:47,256
You're doing great. Stay down a while longer.

510
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:48,325
Sure.

511
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:51,395
Are you trying to shake us for money?

512
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:53,436
Hey. Mister!

513
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:58,906
Where is Seung Jae's body?

514
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:12,585
Gosh, thank you for helping out.

515
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,256
It was nothing. Have a good one.

516
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:15,315
Thanks.

517
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,625
I thought I told them not to get into trouble.

518
00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:26,196
I didn't assault the guy.

519
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,535
Are you taking turns trying to pressure me?

520
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,706
I have no idea what you're talking about.

521
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:36,575
Hey.

522
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:38,946
Where is Min Seung Jae?

523
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,416
Look here, detective.

524
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,315
I don't know who that is.

525
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:50,226
His phone was last pinged in your neighborhood.

526
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:52,026
- Maybe he was nearby. - There's a witness.

527
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:54,256
How could there be a witness when nothing happened?

528
00:32:58,565 --> 00:33:00,436
The police of this nation are worthless.

529
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:01,996
What?

530
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:04,105
Detective Shin.

531
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:06,406
Lee Tae Hyun's father and his lawyer are here.

532
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,845
Hello, detective.

533
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:19,385
I'm Lee Tae Hyun's father.

534
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:28,125
(Lee Soo Ok, a master of ceramics and pottery)

535
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:30,865
And I'm Lee Tae Hyun's lawyer.

536
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:32,696
You'll be talking with me from here on out.

537
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:45,946
He hasn't said a word since his lawyer got here.

538
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:48,015
Detective Shin,

539
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:50,315
do you really believe that Seung Jae is dead?

540
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:52,946
I'm keeping all possibilities open.

541
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:56,315
Anyway, he's lying about not knowing Seung Jae.

542
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:58,526
Do we have a search warrant for his house?

543
00:33:58,526 --> 00:33:59,656
Wait for it.

544
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:01,795
I threatened to go to the press...

545
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:04,326
if they didn't sign off on it.

546
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:06,795
I'll be on standby, then. Give me a call.

547
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:15,576
I didn't know this system could be hacked.

548
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:17,506
Actually, only I can get through this thing.

549
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:19,306
You can't tell anyone though.

550
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:21,076
But what if you get caught?

551
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:22,346
I won't.

552
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:26,315
What's with the lack of security cameras?

553
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,716
This isn't a big city, you know.

554
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:33,455
Anyway, I need to go and call my dad.

555
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,656
What on earth?

556
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,565
Where is he going?

557
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,065
This won't do.

558
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,906
Sometimes, it's better to do things on foot.

559
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:46,975
Let's go.

560
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:49,475
- Hello. - Hello.

561
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:50,975
We were hoping to ask you something.

562
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:52,676
- Sure. - Did you attend the wedding...

563
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,116
that took place downtown on August 8?

564
00:34:55,116 --> 00:34:56,776
- I didn't know about it. - Not me.

565
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:58,645
- What about you ladies? - I didn't go.

566
00:34:58,645 --> 00:34:59,645
I don't know about it.

567
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:01,286
I'm sorry to bother you,

568
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:04,756
but were you parked out here on August 8 as well?

569
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:05,955
Hello,

570
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:08,355
does your security camera...

571
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,156
film across the street as well?

572
00:35:10,366 --> 00:35:11,995
Did you perhaps attend the wedding...

573
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:14,196
that took place downtown on August 8?

574
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,076
- What about Geun Hyoung? - Is he still not back?

575
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:24,576
Darn it. Could he have gone to get a snack or something?

576
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:31,716
Geun Hyoung!

577
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:34,556
Gosh.

578
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:37,326
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

579
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:39,286
Where on earth were you?

580
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:42,855
As you know, my dad is the town headman.

581
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:45,866
In rural areas, the town headman moves faster...

582
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:49,265
than devices with hyper-technology.

583
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:53,006
- My gosh. - There's more.

584
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,335
- He asked the people... - This is amazing.

585
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:57,875
to bring their dash cam footage, and they responded.

586
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,145
Did you find anything?

587
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:05,415
No, not really.

588
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:08,685
A cleaning crew came by that day though.

589
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:11,156
A cleaning crew?

590
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,995
Lee Tae Hyun's father sends one over regularly.

591
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:16,326
The brat only turned out that way...

592
00:36:16,326 --> 00:36:17,895
because his parents coddle him.

593
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:21,265
Anyway, Seung Jae's blood or DNA weren't found at the scene.

594
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:24,736
Could the cleaning crew be in on it too?

595
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,866
Detective Oh is looking into them.

596
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,406
Right.

597
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:36,745
- Mr. Jang. - Yes?

598
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,315
Have you been getting lucky lately?

599
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:40,986
What do you mean?

600
00:36:40,986 --> 00:36:44,955
First Yang Eun Hee and then Min Seung Jae.

601
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,855
We've been getting a lot of weird tips lately.

602
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:47,855
I see.

603
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:51,725
Detective Shin isn't one to believe people easily,

604
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:56,065
but he keeps on saying that Seung Jae is dead.

605
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:58,435
It's possible though.

606
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:01,435
Of course. It's a possibility.

607
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:05,605
But there should be evidence to back up that claim.

608
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,446
I'm just saying.

609
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,545
Right.

610
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:18,455
- Hey, Il Yong. - Captain.

611
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,026
- Where are you headed? - To find Seung Jae.

612
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:23,966
Could you find him for me?

613
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,466
Who is Seung Jae?

614
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:29,065
The high school student who came here last night.

615
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,966
You were out all day yesterday and didn't get to see him.

616
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,975
Have you been to Ro Ha's place?

617
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:37,205
Yes, and no one was there.

618
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:41,915
There's something I want to check, but it's not possible for me.

619
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:44,185
Why don't you ask Wook?

620
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,446
He's the only one we can depend on with these things.

621
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,085
Sure, and I'll look for Seung Jae.

622
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:08,875
You must be Seung Jae.

623
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:11,045
Who are you?

624
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:12,946
Someone older by the looks of it.

625
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:16,875
You weren't home, so I knew you'd be here.

626
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:18,986
How?

627
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:20,716
When I was a newcomer in this town,

628
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,515
I'd come here to stare at the water.

629
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,185
Back then,

630
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:29,196
I was fuming with anger.

631
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,065
It seemed unfair.

632
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:33,596
Those who murdered me were living the good life...

633
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:35,335
while I was stuck here.

634
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:42,105
What were you thinking about?

635
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:44,105
That there's nothing much...

636
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,306
to think about.

637
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:49,145
Up until last week,

638
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:51,986
all I thought about...

639
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,915
were my grades, the CSAT,

640
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:56,886
and college applications.

641
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:00,926
All that is useless to me now,

642
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,096
so I had nothing to think about.

643
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,705
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

644
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:13,875
Captain Kang wanted me to get you.

645
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:16,736
Was there a bracelet...

646
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:19,806
with an embroidery flower at the house?

647
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:21,015
A bracelet?

648
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:23,716
I don't think we found one.

649
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,185
Does it mean something?

650
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:26,685
It's nothing of value,

651
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,315
but it means a great deal to me.

652
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:31,026
It belonged to my late mother.

653
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:32,886
Your late mother?

654
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:34,995
I lost balance and fell when Lee Tae Hyun pushed me.

655
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:37,225
I think it fell on the carpet when that happened.

656
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,065
Wait, a carpet?

657
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:42,596
Yes, the one in front of the TV.

658
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:45,105
I don't need the bracelet,

659
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,276
so please find my brother first.

660
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:02,855
Just one bite.

661
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:04,756
Here.

662
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:08,725
Come on in, guys. Sit down.

663
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:10,096
- Okay. - I'll bring you some food quickly.

664
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:11,625
Eat up.

665
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,036
Seung Jae, eat with us.

666
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:15,395
Shall I?

667
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:17,906
Captain, I want more rice!

668
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:19,605
Okay, no problem!

669
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:21,576
You're a big eater.

670
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:24,406
I'll eat well and become strong so I can be a professional runner.

671
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,216
Nice. Eat up.

672
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:29,576
Here.

673
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,786
Oh, my goodness. I can't believe it.

674
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:35,415
Look at you, sweetheart. You're eating on your own.

675
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:37,156
Nice, you're eating so well.

676
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:39,855
Il Yong, did you hit her?

677
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:43,625
Captain, please. I mixed her rice with some water for her.

678
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:45,995
And she's eating so well now. Right?

679
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:49,466
She likes to eat side dishes separately.

680
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:51,906
I guess she likes her rice a little soggy.

681
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:55,776
Il Yong, how did you know?

682
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:58,645
Alice and I like similar stuff when it comes to food.

683
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,486
They still haven't found evidence?

684
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:05,616
Evidence?

685
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:08,315
We spoon-fed them all the info, yet they haven't caught him.

686
00:41:09,315 --> 00:41:11,355
Instead of handing that jerk over to the police,

687
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:13,085
we should've caught him ourselves.

688
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:15,056
And where would we keep him?

689
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:18,966
But Detective Shin seems to believe you, so he'll catch him.

690
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:21,236
Okay, but when?

691
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,596
I don't know, you punk. Why are you yelling at me?

692
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:25,265
Oh, sorry.

693
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,036
I got a little worked up.

694
00:41:27,036 --> 00:41:28,105
All right.

695
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,276
You can go out now. Sit down on the bench and play.

696
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:32,975
- I'll give you some ice cream. - Hi, my sweet pumpkins.

697
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:34,815
- Hyun Ji's dad is here. - Hi!

698
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,946
- You're so adorable. - Mister!

699
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:39,545
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

700
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:42,386
- Why didn't you go to school today? - We're on our lunch break.

701
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:43,955
- I see. What did you eat? - Yes.

702
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:45,286
Delicious things.

703
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:48,495
- What are you going to do now? - We'll have ice cream.

704
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,136
Why are you still here?

705
00:41:57,536 --> 00:41:58,806
Uncle Wook.

706
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:00,435
- What will you do after that? - Hi, Alice.

707
00:42:01,506 --> 00:42:02,975
Did you miss me?

708
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:05,806
Kids, come and have some ice cream.

709
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,515
- Go get your ice cream. - Let's go.

710
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:08,545
- Ice cream! - Ice cream!

711
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:09,875
- I want this one. - Here's your ice cream.

712
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:11,716
Let's go have some ice cream.

713
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:13,886
- I want this one. - I'll have this one.

714
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:16,455
You're here.

715
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:18,756
Alice, you should have some ice cream too.

716
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:19,886
Here, Alice.

717
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,795
It's good to see you here.

718
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,995
Seung Jae, can you take the kids to school later?

719
00:42:29,165 --> 00:42:30,196
Sure.

720
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:31,806
Mr. Jang.

721
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,736
Wook. Spare me a minute.

722
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:36,136
Il Yong, you too.

723
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:42,776
So they caught the culprit, but they'll let him go?

724
00:42:43,216 --> 00:42:45,486
That makes no sense.

725
00:42:45,486 --> 00:42:46,515
My point, exactly.

726
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:50,315
If they continue to struggle, we'll have to find Seung Jae ourselves.

727
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:52,486
I told you we needed irrefutable evidence.

728
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:56,326
So what was the murder weapon?

729
00:42:56,596 --> 00:42:58,196
I haven't had a chance to ask him yet.

730
00:42:58,196 --> 00:43:00,096
The other kids were with him, so I couldn't ask.

731
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,435
I'll go ask Seung Jae.

732
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:04,065
- I'll come with you. - It's okay.

733
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:07,065
I have a lot more in common with Seung Jae than you do.

734
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,446
- I'll be right back. - All right.

735
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:17,446
You saw that, right?

736
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:19,585
He flat out belittles me.

737
00:43:20,145 --> 00:43:21,955
That's what he's really like.

738
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:23,515
Gosh, stop it.

739
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:26,585
Il Yong isn't exactly the friendly type, you know.

740
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:29,756
No, it's not that. He's avoiding me because he's hiding something.

741
00:43:29,895 --> 00:43:32,565
Why are you so irked by Il Yong?

742
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,105
Goodness. I think I know what he's up to.

743
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:41,875
Weirdo.

744
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:44,446
Goodness.

745
00:43:45,645 --> 00:43:46,676
Gosh, I feel hot.

746
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:02,725
- Let's play properly. - Sure.

747
00:44:03,656 --> 00:44:05,065
Before that, let me ask you something.

748
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:07,736
Captain Kang told me...

749
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,835
that you came here while trying to save your sister.

750
00:44:10,966 --> 00:44:13,335
Do you remember the jerk who made you like this?

751
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:18,406
Of course, I do. I had never met him before that day,

752
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:21,245
but he was also the last person I saw before I came here.

753
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,116
But why do you ask?

754
00:44:23,815 --> 00:44:25,685
What? Oh...

755
00:44:26,745 --> 00:44:29,286
I just wanted to tell you to never forget.

756
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:32,556
Many people end up here without knowing what happened to them.

757
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:34,596
Do you remember?

758
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,455
Me? Of course, I remember.

759
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:39,026
Even the knife that jerk used to stab me.

760
00:44:40,696 --> 00:44:41,835
You were stabbed?

761
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:43,736
Yes.

762
00:44:44,506 --> 00:44:45,506
What about you?

763
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:49,835
He hit me with his golf club.

764
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:52,875
His golf club?

765
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:57,786
Seung Jae, are you good at basketball?

Yes, Shin Jun Ho speaking.

He used his golf club to kill Seung Jae.

776
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:57,076
We didn't find any golf clubs at the scene.

And the carpet in the living room is gone too.

You didn't find a golf bag?

Hold on. Come to think of it...

780
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,515
When Lee Tae Hyun said he was going on a golf trip,

781
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,955
he didn't have a golf bag.

782
00:46:09,415 --> 00:46:11,826
It means they hid everything.

From the moment Ye Won sneaked out to come to the substation...

to the moment the police arrived, there was a 20-minute gap.

It's not enough time...

to hide the carpet and the body in a faraway spot.

Okay, sure. I will.

815
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,022
Ha Yoon, come on.

816
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,062
Bye, mister. I'll see you soon.

817
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:57,132
Min Seung Jae is dead.

818
00:48:00,332 --> 00:48:01,902
Captain, are they sending us backup?

819
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:04,102
I put in a rush request, so we're on our way there together now.

820
00:48:04,102 --> 00:48:05,641
Who will we find there?

821
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:07,272
Min Seung Jae.

822
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:10,382
When Seung Jae got the text message from Ye Won,

823
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:12,611
he went to Lee Tae Hyun's place to get her.

824
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:15,821
While Lee Tae Hyun was preoccupied with Seung Jae,

825
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:17,522
Ye Won managed to sneak out.

826
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:20,252
Then Lee Tae Hyun killed Seung Jae with a golf club.

827
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:32,902
Then the couple got rid of the bloody carpet...

828
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:34,801
along with the murder weapons and the body.

829
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:37,872
In the 20 minutes it took for the police to arrive,

830
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:39,841
two people moved all of these things far away from the scene?

831
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:41,681
It's absolutely impossible.

832
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:48,352
They had an enthusiastic accomplice.

833
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:55,562
And...

834
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,591
all of the evidence in this case including Min Seung Jae...

835
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:02,562
is in that person's hands right now.

836
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:33,232
I'm done.

837
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:36,361
Goodness, you worked so hard, Seung Jae.

838
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,872
I said you didn't have to do that.

839
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,372
I lost the game. I should keep my promise.

840
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:43,372
I'll be going now.

841
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:47,611
Here. I packed some snacks for you.

842
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:50,511
There. Eat some when you get hungry, okay?

843
00:49:50,511 --> 00:49:51,681
I'm fine, though.

844
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:53,312
Thank you.

845
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:56,482
- Goodnight. - Right, get going.

846
00:49:56,482 --> 00:49:57,551
Okay.

847
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:13,602
Are you Ye Won?

848
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:17,002
Seung Jae told me a lot about you.

849
00:50:19,071 --> 00:50:20,241
Who are you?

850
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:24,411
I'm Seung Jae's teacher at his academy.

851
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:27,511
Gosh, my back.

852
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:30,482
Goodness, you're making such a fuss.

853
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:32,821
Hey, someone might think you did all the dishes in the town.

854
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,591
I may not look like it, but I grew up sheltered.

855
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:37,062
You do look like it. You look like a rich kid.

856
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,491
And you look like you have a great life.

857
00:50:39,761 --> 00:50:40,761
Me?

858
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:44,402
Things aren't the way they seem.

859
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:48,071
It's the same for me.

860
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:56,042
A few years ago,

861
00:50:56,911 --> 00:50:58,812
my mom died of cancer.

862
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:05,252
I thought she had thrown it away.

863
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:07,821
But it's right there.

864
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:10,221
My mom gave this to my sister.

865
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:16,332
But Ye Won resented our mom.

866
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:18,431
That she had abandoned her.

867
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:23,801
My friends were picked up by their moms after their academy lessons.

868
00:51:24,672 --> 00:51:26,971
And they celebrated their birthdays together too.

869
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:30,741
But...

870
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:33,882
I didn't have a mom when I went home.

871
00:51:35,422 --> 00:51:36,821
You had your brother...

872
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:38,922
and dad too.

873
00:51:39,451 --> 00:51:42,491
My dad went on business trips all the time so I barely saw him.

874
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:43,891
My brother...

875
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:48,861
went to school like nothing was wrong even when Mom was gone.

876
00:51:49,632 --> 00:51:51,132
And to the academy too.

877
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:55,571
I thought, "To him, going to college must be more important than Mom."

878
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,571
"That must be why he's so fine."

879
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:04,882
That's what I thought.

880
00:52:08,382 --> 00:52:10,022
Ye Won didn't even go to school,

881
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:14,091
and Dad would always drink and cry late at night.

882
00:52:17,022 --> 00:52:18,632
If I fell apart too,

883
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:22,761
I'd feel too sorry to my mom.

884
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,172
It wasn't her fault that she was sick.

885
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:28,701
So I thought that if I did well,

886
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,611
maybe Ye Won and Dad would come back to normal too.

887
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:35,281
So Seung Jae...

888
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,252
held back his own sadness...

889
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:42,122
and wanted to become a better brother for you.

890
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:46,321
Just like how he skipped his academy lessons...

891
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:51,292
and came to get me.

892
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:53,091
Right.

893
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:56,031
You were...

894
00:52:57,332 --> 00:52:59,571
so much more important to him than going to college.

895
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:06,272
I had thought...

896
00:53:07,772 --> 00:53:09,982
that Ye Won hated Mom all this time.

897
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:29,232
But I knew then. Ye Won cherished Mom so much.

898
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,602
She was just really hurt.

899
00:53:36,701 --> 00:53:37,872
I was so foolish.

900
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:40,971
I didn't even know that.

901
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:46,511
I hated that she didn't show up for Mom's death anniversary,

902
00:53:48,022 --> 00:53:49,652
so I told her that she wasn't even family anymore.

903
00:53:50,382 --> 00:53:51,491
Back then,

904
00:53:52,451 --> 00:53:54,192
when he said that to you,

905
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:58,192
he felt very sorry.

906
00:54:03,861 --> 00:54:05,531
But I was wrong.

907
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:11,141
When I see him again later on,

908
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:14,111
I'll have to tell him.

909
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:22,482
I can't even apologize now. What do I do?

910
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:28,922
You protected her.

911
00:54:30,821 --> 00:54:31,891
That's enough.

912
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:36,701
Gosh, your life was really hard too.

(Supermarket)

914
00:55:26,582 --> 00:55:28,221
Still, today was a fun day.

915
00:55:29,022 --> 00:55:30,482
I didn't worry about my family,

916
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:33,152
ate home-cooked food instead of eating out,

917
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:35,792
and played basketball with you.

918
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:40,531
Let's play again next week.

919
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,701
I won't go easy on you then.

920
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:45,002
Sure, anytime.

921
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:54,272
There are so many stars here.

922
00:55:55,582 --> 00:55:56,611
I know, right?

923
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:09,761
Police. Don't move.

924
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:13,031
Who's there?

925
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:16,761
Put that fire out. Put it out now!

926
00:56:25,772 --> 00:56:27,471
You. Who are you?

Darn it. Hey.

Hey, Lee Tae Hyun.

930
00:56:51,931 --> 00:56:52,971
You're under arrest for the murder...

931
00:56:52,971 --> 00:56:54,002
and abandoning the body of Min Seung Jae.

932
00:56:54,002 --> 00:56:55,071
Let go of me.

933
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:05,252
I feel like...

934
00:57:06,181 --> 00:57:07,812
my mom would be somewhere up there.

935
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,091
I'll tell her when I meet her someday.

936
00:57:14,522 --> 00:57:16,721
That Ye Won held onto her bracelet.

937
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:20,962
And...

938
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:25,602
that I missed her so much.

939
00:57:49,622 --> 00:57:50,922
My body feels strange.

940

Day 10,881.

then left after exactly two days.

I'm worried about those who are left.

You don't mind people as they come, but you do when they leave.

I feel empty already.

She did. I wonder how far away she is.

978
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:51,422
Just as we were talking about her.

979
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:53,761
Hi, Jjonga.

980
01:02:53,931 --> 01:02:56,632
Wook. I know what Jung A's abductor looks like.

981
01:02:58,132 --> 01:03:00,201
- What? - In an alley near the dress shop.

982
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,372
A passing car filmed him.

983
01:03:03,372 --> 01:03:04,872
Yes, I'll take it to the police.

984
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,372
I'll go home tomorrow.

985
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:10,841
I stared at a monitor all day. I think my eyes will bleed.

986
01:03:12,051 --> 01:03:13,681
Okay, bye.

987
01:03:14,752 --> 01:03:16,781
Call the police substation. Say we'll come by.

988
01:03:27,562 --> 01:03:29,801
Let me live! Don't kill me.

989
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:32,372
- I can't die. - Shut your mouth and listen.

990
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,931
Help me! Can anyone hear me?

991
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:37,902
Let me go.

992
01:03:39,672 --> 01:03:42,141
Let me see my daughter.

993
01:03:42,882 --> 01:03:45,781
Please. Let me see Bo Ra.

994
01:03:46,181 --> 01:03:48,551
Until I see Bo Ra one last time,

995
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:51,681
I can't die. Someone help me!

996
01:03:55,192 --> 01:03:56,261
Unless you want to die,

997
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:58,732
keep still.

998
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:00,292
Help me!

999
01:04:01,062 --> 01:04:02,132
Someone...

1000
01:04:11,971 --> 01:04:13,042
Yesterday.

1001
01:04:13,911 --> 01:04:16,011
Yes. I have lots to tell you too.

1002
01:04:16,011 --> 01:04:18,582
Get back here, and I'll tell you in person.

1003
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:21,312
Drive safely. Bye.

1004
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:30,522
Kid. What are you doing here?

1005
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:34,491
Oh. You're...

1006
01:04:35,502 --> 01:04:38,201
the Brave Citizen Award recipient, right?

1007
01:04:38,632 --> 01:04:39,632
I am.

1008
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:48,882
I'm glad you came by. This is the place.

1009
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:52,312
Catching con artists isn't that easy, you know.

1010
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:54,551
We can't do an interview out here.

1011
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:56,422
There's a bakery nearby. Let's talk there.

1012
01:04:57,316 --> 01:04:58,385
Dad.

1013
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:00,522
Bread.

1014
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:11,132
Dad.

1015
01:05:14,602 --> 01:05:16,571
Who? Me?

1016
01:05:18,071 --> 01:05:19,772
Yes. Dad.

1017
01:05:43,531 --> 01:05:46,402
(Missing: The Other Side 2)

1018
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:49,542
Does Se Young... Does your mom know you're here?

1019
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:51,801
Can I stay here for a while?

1020
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:53,812
You sent Hyun Ji off.

1021
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:55,841
Hyun Ji is not here.

1022
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,042
Hyun Ji.

1023
01:05:58,852 --> 01:06:00,681
Bo Ra. It's Mom.

1024
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:01,752
Moon Se Young?

1025
01:06:01,752 --> 01:06:04,522
She sounded very on edge, like she was being chased.

1026
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:07,692
Was Moon Se Young abducted?

1027
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,692
We might be able to save her.

1028
01:06:10,192 --> 01:06:12,292
This is where Se Young was?

1029
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,462
Has it been two years?

1030
01:06:15,192 --> 01:06:17,201
Did you approach me intentionally?

1031
01:06:18,201 --> 01:06:19,201
What are you?
