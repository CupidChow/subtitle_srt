Do you think Kim Wook knows where Oh Il Yong hid my stuff?

170
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:26,387
Shall I get them both?

171
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,418
- If you ask them... - No.

172
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:30,727
I just need Oh Il Yong.

173
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,627
Kim Wook will come to me on his own.

174

There's a chance he won't.

175

That's not how you do math.

If there's a chance he won't,

177
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,568
it means it's most likely he will.

Right?

181
00:13:56,617 --> 00:14:00,217
So it was Il Yong you saw in your dreams?

182
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:02,558
Yes.

183
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:08,658
I kept seeing the same woman, so at first...

184
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:12,298
I thought she and I had a connection.

185
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,267
It turned out...

186
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,538
it was...

187
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,737
Il Yong in the bed.

188
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:23,678
It was definitely my dream,

Isn't that weird?

191
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,288
It is weird.

192
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:37,028
How desperate must he have been to be in your dream?

193
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:39,928
I should've caught on sooner.

194
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,727
Who could've made sense of that?

195
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,267
Only you did because you're so doubtful.

196
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:47,068
Good for you.

197

You saved Il Yong's life.

198
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,808
It's an odd feeling.

331
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:20,058
- Hello. - Hello.

332
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,687
Yes, I remember him.

333
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,687
Has it been about two years?

334
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,328
Your hair is very long now.

335
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:29,397
He has some questions about Il Yong.

336
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,937
I heard Il Yong and Kim Pil Joong were friends.

337
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:35,468
From what I've heard, I guess that...

338
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,437
he hid something that belonged to Kim Pil Joong.

339
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:41,308
Finding out what it is will help our investigation.

340
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:42,738
Mr. Kim.

341
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,048
You kind of know the situation, so I'll tell you what's going on.

342
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,647
As soon as Kim Pil Joong died,

343
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,647
a new Goliath appeared...

344
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,548
and is even more active than his predecessor.

345
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,657
It means someone is behind Goliath.

346
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:59,058
If Il Yong actually hid something that belonged to Kim Pil Joong,

347
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,927
he's certainly not safe right now.

348
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,798
So tell me what you know.

349
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:16,347
Then will the police guarantee Il Yong's safety?

350
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:18,748
Even as we speak, he's in the hospital alone.

351
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:24,387
Yes, we'll protect him 24-7.

352
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:35,528
I don't know what it is that he hid.

353
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:36,528
But...

354
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,637
Il Yong, Mr. Noh is going nuts looking for you.

355
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:41,897
You don't have time for this.

356
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:46,677
I heard Mr. Noh was looking for him.

357
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:47,838
Mr. Noh?

358
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:49,647
Do you know who that is?

359
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:51,248
No, I don't.

360
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:53,518
But...

361
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:57,548
there's someone suspicious.

362
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,758
I have many questions for you as well, my dear.

363
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,387
But you should save him first.

364
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,187
We'll meet again soon.

365
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:08,328
There's a guy who showed up there that day.

366
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:11,028
He told me that we'd meet again soon.

367
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:17,038
It's this man.

368
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,607
I've never seen him before.

369
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,207
Is he a thug?

370
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,207
No, he didn't give off that vibe.

371
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:27,078
His style is...

372
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:30,248
I'd say... He creeped me out.

373
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:38,228
Is there anything specific you can tell us?

374
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,828
He looks familiar for some reason.

375
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:42,998
The way he talks...

376
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,998
Shall I say he sounded cheesy?

377
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:50,338
He called me "My dear."

378
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:53,978
You rarely see young people say stuff like that these days.

379
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:57,548
Oops! Sorry.

380
00:24:57,677 --> 00:24:58,978
I'm sorry.

381
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:02,417
You first. Go ahead, my dear.

382
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:04,718
Sorry. Thank you.

383
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:06,818
Right.

384
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:09,117
I remember.

385
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:12,588
The day I visited Lee Dong Min,

386
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:14,897
I ran into him in the corridor.

387
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:17,768
Then who was this man visiting?

388
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,367
We'll find out. Let's go.

389
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,338
What? Where do you think you're going?

390
00:25:26,637 --> 00:25:28,707
I'll check the visitor log at the prison.

391
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,947
Mr. Kim. Thank you, but a civilian should stay out of this.

392
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,478
And you. Just stay at the office.

393
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:34,677
You haven't fully recovered.

394
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:36,687
Should I tell Il Doo?

395
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:42,617
Mr. Kim, we'll need your help on Oh Il Yong's case.

396
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:43,758
Thank you in advance.

397
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,427
Please call me!

Where is his house?

400
00:25:57,268 --> 00:26:00,707
Excuse me, sir. Do you know Mr. Im Jong Yoon?

401
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:02,407
He lives around here.

Oh, Mr. Im?

404

It's that house over there, the one with the blue roof.

We wanted to visit you to thank you in person.

Hi.

You came all the way here. You should at least eat.

429

We really came to just say hello.

430
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:34,137
You should leave on a full stomach since there's a long journey ahead.

It's okay, sir.

432

The wind is cold. You should go inside.

You said the same thing when I went to your house in Duon Village.

00:31:48,788 --> 00:31:51,857
Oh Il Yong still hasn't woken up.

494
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,068
What if that punk really has no hope?

495
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:11,177
Treat your friends to some meat.

496
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,478
Dress them and feed them well.

497
00:32:15,478 --> 00:32:17,887
And keep them away from drugs. That's how you succeed.

498
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,117
Yes, sir. Thank you.

499
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:21,387
I'm off.

- and these. - Wait, what...

503
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:33,127
- Is this 30,000 dollars? - Yes.

504
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:36,637
The old lady sprayed salt right after we left.

505
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,937
And the old man gave us this talisman and the 30,000 dollars.

506
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:41,907
What's this situation we're in?

507
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:44,008
It's an uncomfortable situation.

508
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:46,107
Did they owe Captain Kang?

509
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:48,177
Then they would've said so.

510
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,718
"We owe her some money, so we're paying you instead."

511
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:53,117
That's all we would've needed.

512
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:56,828
Anyway, let's give this money back,

513
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,028
and the two of you should go and ask Captain Kang about this.

514
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,328
Why Im Jong Yoon gave us this money.

515
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:04,367
- I'll do some research too. - Okay.

516
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,937
Jong Yoon said that? That I lent him money?

517
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:12,607
He didn't say that exactly.

518
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,637
I just said that I was your nephew,

519
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,078
and he gave me an envelope with money inside.

520
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,147
There were 30,000 dollars in checks.

521
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:22,318
Gosh, 30,000 dollars...

522
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:25,417
would've been worth an entire house back then.

523
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:28,157
Last time, I saw you had hurt your left finger.

524
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:29,417
When did that happen?

525
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:31,588
That was when I was working with my husband.

526
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,197
My finger got caught while doing repairs on the boat.

527
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:37,927
I couldn't even set sail because I had to get my finger treated.

528
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,097
Sun Hee cried a lot and went through so much.

529
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,707
Is Sun Hee doing well?

530
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:45,437
Yes, she's still going strong.

531
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,377
Gosh, she's going strong.

532
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:51,577
Did they sell the house you used to live in for 30,000 dollars?

533
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,348
Or was it for the boat?

534
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,548
Can't you remember anything?

535
00:33:57,388 --> 00:33:58,388
I'm not sure.

536
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,187
Hold on.

537
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:10,727
Your insurance?

538
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:13,098
After what happened to Ju Won and my husband,

539
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,598
I didn't get a single penny from insurance.

540
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:18,807
These days, you have to have insurance for your boats,

541
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,167
but it wasn't like that back then.

542
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:24,408
So as soon as I started sailing, I got insurance for everything.

543
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:27,718
In case something happens to me, the living should go on living.

544
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:31,187
I got myself an insurance policy along with my crew.

545
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:33,988
The beneficiaries were Jong Yoon and Sun Hee.

546
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:37,888
That couple was my closest family.

547
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,497
Yes, this is it.

549

Goodness.

550
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,968
This money was for them. Why did they give this back now?

551
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,098
This family is so nice like that.

552
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:49,868
So that was what happened.

553
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:52,707
Anyway, we'll give it back to them, so don't worry.

554
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:58,807
Gosh.

556
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:03,948
I must be a snob.

557
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:06,448
Yes, you are. Did you just realize that?

558
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,287
When I heard about Captain Kang's insurance money,

559
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,397
I kept thinking about something else in my head.

560
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:19,028
I kept quiet in case it hurt Captain Kang's feelings,

561
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:21,568
but something doesn't feel right.

562
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:23,607
Right? It feels weird to you too, doesn't it?

563
00:35:23,607 --> 00:35:24,607
Yes.

564
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:27,638
I'll have to look into it when I go to return the checks.

565
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:32,008
I'll go to the hospital and then take Bo Ra home.

566
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:33,247
Okay.

- Got it, sir. - Keep up the good work.

599
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:54,666
Noh Yoon Gu knew about the narcotics case.

600
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,867
He had Jang Do Ri...

601

order Kim Pil Joong to stash the cocaine...

602

and stay low.

- Is it done? - Yes, sir.

604

Anyone will see it as an overdose.

The police aren't that naive though.

606

But all will be well as long as it can't be traced back to us.

He killed Kim Pil Joong...

612
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:32,607
to throw the Drug Squad off his trail.

613
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:35,806
What about Lee Dong Min?

614
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,746
You were stabbed...

615
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,576
after visiting him in prison.

616
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:43,346
Lee Dong Min definitely had an axe to grind.

617
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:45,317
That's why he sent you those letters.

618
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:47,786
When I visited, he said...

619
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,786
that he blamed us for his incarceration.

620
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,186
Unbelievable.

621
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:57,427
What good do detention centres do when criminals won't repent?

622
00:38:58,027 --> 00:38:59,967
So he hired Noh Yoon Gu...

623
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:02,197
to have you stabbed and to threaten Bo Ra?

624
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,306
That's highly likely.

625
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:06,166
Why Noh Yoon Gu though?

626
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:08,476
Did Lee Dong Min pay him?

627
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,277
Or does he have some sort of leverage on Noh?

628
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:13,346
I can't tell for sure,

629
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:17,686
but Noh Yoon Gu could've used Lee Dong Min in his own way.

630
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:19,717
Meaning?

631
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,857
To get us to suspect Lee Dong Min instead of him.

632
00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:30,257
Was the prison affair absolutely necessary?

633
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:34,496
Must you ask?

634
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:38,107
I'm grateful for what he did for me,

635
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:41,976
but I'm not the same person anymore.

636
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:46,706
I'm not desperate enough...

It's me.

00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,096
Okay!

- Should I bring him to you? - No.

662
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:23,436
I should visit him in the hospital.

663
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:32,346
Il Yong, it's Wook.

For the next few days,

668
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,427
he'll spend more time sleeping than being awake.

669
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:49,536
Are you certain he gained consciousness?

670
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,467
Yes, his senses will slowly come back as well.

What did Il Yong say?

706
00:44:05,036 --> 00:44:07,007
Does he remember his time at the village?

707
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:10,407
He opened his eyes, but he soon went back to sleep.

708
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:13,277
He'll be like that while he recovers.

He has you crying once again.

I'm glad he's alive.

714

She was thrilled as though it was her who came back to life.

715
00:44:45,576 --> 00:44:49,547
But ironically, what happened to Captain Kang...

716
00:44:50,076 --> 00:44:51,217
still remains a mystery.

717
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:54,146
That's why I've been digging.

718
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,927
A total of eight people boarded The Juwon that day.

719
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:01,197
They came across a typhoon, and six of them...

720
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:02,797
took shelter below deck.

721
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:05,826
Only Captain Kang and Im Jong Yoon stayed back.

722
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:07,666
- Outside? - Yes.

723
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:11,206
Captain Kang was in her cabin trying to radio for help.

724
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:12,706
She said so herself.

725
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:16,576
There was no notice of a storm,

726
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:18,646
but it put us through the wringer that day.

727
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:22,416
This is The Juwon calling for help.

728
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:25,416
We are heading to Seongu Port from our current location.

729
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:27,786
The Juwon is trying to sail safely to Seongu Port.

730
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:29,186
The Juwon?

731
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:31,326
- The lightning stuck, - Can you repeat that?

732
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:32,887
and I saw Jong Yoon out on the deck.

733
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,726
Darn it.

734
00:45:37,357 --> 00:45:40,666
Jong Yoon, head below deck!

735
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:42,536
Do you have a death wish?

736
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:49,076
She was in the captain's cabin until the last second?

737
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:50,376
Yes.

738
00:45:50,907 --> 00:45:51,907
That's odd.

739
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:56,746
According to the boat's last correspondence,

740
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:59,317
the captain who was on deck couldn't be seen.

741
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:02,217
And then she fell into the water.

742
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:05,226
But Captain Kang said...

743
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:07,286
that she lost consciousness while radioing for help.

744
00:46:08,257 --> 00:46:12,126
What Captain Kang remembers doesn't match your findings.

745
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:15,467
Jjonga, do you have the boat's radio log?

746
00:46:15,896 --> 00:46:18,706
Yes, ten minutes prior to the final radio call,

747
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:21,936
It said they tried to avoid an obstacle at sea.

748
00:46:22,436 --> 00:46:24,206
That fits what Captain Kang said.

749
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:28,346
How could someone unconscious walk on deck and fall into the sea?

750
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:31,846
Exactly. Something doesn't make sense.

751
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:38,226
After that,

752
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:40,757
Mr. Im didn't go out to sea for a while.

753
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:42,456
He was traumatized.

754
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:46,367
He recently had a bout of shingles.

755
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:48,596
I heard that hurts bad.

756
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,867
He must've had a rough life when he was younger.

757
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:55,436
I hope he was in better health.

758
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:57,007
I know.

759
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:00,646

00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:04,887

We came to return something.

765
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:13,987

767
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:22,137
Why is she so upset?

768
00:47:33,846 --> 00:47:35,777
She seemed to be so sad.

769
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,186
She's like a different person.

770
00:47:40,717 --> 00:47:41,757

00:49:59,427 --> 00:50:01,186
She can be weird.

819
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:03,726
She jumps whenever someone comes close.

820
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:06,226
She did a few exorcisms to chase some ghosts too.

821
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:08,396
I heard she's on psychiatry meds...

822
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:09,737
but they don't seem to be working.

823
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:13,607
- Thanks. - Sure.

825
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:28,056
My goodness.

826
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:31,217
Memorial rites are a lot of work.

827
00:50:33,587 --> 00:50:36,096
They mourned my whole family for over 30 years.

828
00:50:40,226 --> 00:50:41,996
It must've been tough on poor Sun Hee.

829
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:46,666
How am I to make it up to her?

830
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:56,376
I should fix Alice's dinner.

831
00:50:57,246 --> 00:50:59,717
Why do you keep coming here to take from us?

832
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:02,416
Ma'am, that's not why we're here.

833

Both he and I, we did more than enough for Eun Sil!

834

What's the matter with you?

835
00:51:08,996 --> 00:51:12,326
Will you please calm down?

836
00:51:12,326 --> 00:51:16,367
I was haunted for the past 30 years!

837
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:19,967
So please, will you leave us alone?

838
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:21,067
Go away!

839
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:23,137
Sun Hee.

Sun Hee.

841

It's Eun Sil.

Stop!

845
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:42,297
Eun Sil, I sent you off so you could rest.

846
00:51:45,396 --> 00:51:47,527
Please...

847
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:50,737
Pull yourself together!

848

What are you talking about?

849
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,036
You "sent her off?"

850
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:14,357
I'll make Alice's favourite, dried radish leaf soup for dinner.

851
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:19,896
I wonder why the kid likes that of all things?

We didn't come here to ask,

853
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,117
but I guess something happened?

854
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,286
I wonder what's in here.

855
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:46,527
Where do you think you're going?

856
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:47,726
Don't push.

857
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:49,857
You didn't have to push so hard.

858
00:52:50,996 --> 00:52:55,637
Did you two "send off" Captain Kang?

859
00:52:56,496 --> 00:52:58,536
Who sent whom off?

860
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:02,237
Who do you think got the rest of the crew safely home?

861
00:53:02,237 --> 00:53:03,737
If it hadn't been for him,

862
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:06,206
it wouldn't have ended with the Captain!

863
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:08,646
All eight could've died...

864
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:11,617
and my husband saved them all!

865

Where did you send her to?

Where are you, kiddo?

00:53:40,907 --> 00:53:42,277
Where are you?

870
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:51,487
Here you are.

871
00:53:55,126 --> 00:53:57,056
There's nothing here.

872
00:53:57,257 --> 00:53:58,326
Where is it?

873
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,697
Find it if you can.

874
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:04,936
All that's here is her ghost!

875

The house, the boat, and the warehouse!

876

Her ghost haunts them all!

877
00:54:12,476 --> 00:54:15,146
It's been suffocating me for 30 years!

878
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:17,376
Will you stop it?

879
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:18,846
- Stop it. - Get out here!

880
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:20,786

Come out.

893
00:55:02,496 --> 00:55:04,357
Come on out.
