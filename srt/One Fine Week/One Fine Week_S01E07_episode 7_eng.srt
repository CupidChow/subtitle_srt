1
00:00:00,559 --> 00:00:02,939
There's only four days left of filming now.

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,579
 You must be happy since you really didn't want to do it.  
    

3
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:10,629
 It's not as bad for me as you, but I also can't sleep well in unfamiliar places.  

4
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,959
 I brought it so I could fall asleep while reading. 

5
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:17,059
I actually like being here more than I thought.

6
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,449
Wow, I can't forget it even though I want to.

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:24,989
 I'll make a different one especially for you. 
 I'm just being good to her since we're filming.  

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,959
Did you sleep well?

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,219
- Didn't you forget this? 
 - I didn't know.

10
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:45,749
- Do you not read it anymore to fall asleep? 
 - These days... I've had lots on my mind.

11
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,419
Here's the mission for today.

12
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:57,429
 Mission: Enjoy a casual date in public.   

13
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,229
Can everyone scoot back a bit, please?

14
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,219
If you stop taking photos and wait a bit further back,

15
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,909
we'll make some time for you after we are done filming.

16
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,869
Is this really a 'casual date'?

17
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:11,779
It's filming something that it supposed to look like a casual date.

18
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:17,239
That's true. I, too, need to realize that all of this is just for filming.

19
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,869
- No, I meant... 
  - Let's move locations.

20
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,809
Can you please autograph this for me? Please!

21
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:24,029
Just one autograph please!

22
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,969
I'll be right back.

23
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,669
- Autograph here please! 
 - So good looking!

24
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,149
Amazing! You're really good looking.

25
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,559
- Can I get an autograph please? 
 - Oh... sure.

26
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:47,959
- What's your name? 
 - Just give me an autograph.

27
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,789
Where did she...

28
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,069
What was that?

29
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:41,709
I'm really sorry, but can we take a break for just one hour?

30
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,319
It's fine now. We can go back.

31
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,889
What do you mean go back?

32
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,519
We were in the middle of filming.

33
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,499
You said last time you don't like people who think of you as a puppet.

34
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:05,329
You're making yourself a puppet right now. We can rest for just an hour.

35
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,559
- If we suddenly take a break, what will the staff members do? 
 - For goodness sake!

36
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:14,979
Why are you like this? If you're having a hard time, you can say so. If you're scared, you can say so.

37
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:20,679
How incredible and kind are you? If you're so considerate of others, why did you talk about me so carelessly?

38
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,339
What?

39
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,109
I just blurted out nonsense.

40
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,549
Tell me. What did I say?

41
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,689
Tell me.

42
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:41,819
I heard you on the phone at the supermarket.

43
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,979
You could do that. It's normal to have those kinds of conversations with your friends, but...

44
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,019
I just thought...

45
00:03:54,789 --> 00:04:00,389
I thought we were getting along quite well.

46
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:03,469
- Can you look at me? 
 - It's fine. Forget it.

47
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:06,299
I have something to tell you, so look at me.

48
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,509
Long time no see. Give me the pictures.

49
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,339
- Let go!  
 - Give them to me.

50
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,659
- What if I can't give them to you? 
 - Then I can't let go!

51
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,899
- Gosh, you really.. 
- Okay, okay. I'll delete them.

52
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,419
What happened?

53
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:50,199
That's not important.

54
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,659
Let's talk.

55
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,659
I'll be honest.

56
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,049
Sometimes, there are people like that.

57
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,289
They think of women as objects.

58
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,759
 Next time, bring her out. Did you get her number? 

59
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,219
Of those people, there's one person who seems particularly bothered by me.

60
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,629
 Hang up for a bit, I'll call you back later. 
Jung Woo! I heard you're filming something with Kim Byul from Angels? 

61
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:26,189
He becomes interested in any girls he thinks I'm close to.

62
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,179
 - I don't know yet. 
 - What do you mean you don't know? I already heard about it.  

63
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:33,199
 - She's hella cute! Are you going to date her? 
 - Why would I date her? 

64
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,199
On that day too, he called and asked me about you, so I just pretended like we weren't close.

65
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,939
 Why would we date? 

66
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,489
I didn't want him to be interested in you.

67
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:49,449
I'm sorry I caused a misunderstanding.

68
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:54,489
That's what it was? I didn't even know that...

69
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:58,929
I glared at you and ignored you...

70
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,039
- Why did you say there wasn't anything? 
 - What do you mean?

71
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,069
Anything wrong.

72
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:11,039
I was right, there was something wrong. I asked you so many times. Why did you deny it?

73
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,949
I mean... how could I? This is all a part of broadcasting and our work.

74
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,099
How can I tell you everything that I felt upset at?

75
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,659
Tell me.

76
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:26,289
From now on, for the program or whatever, tell me everything.

77
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,979
- Byul, do you like my brother? 
 - Huh? Yes.

78
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,279
No!

79
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,669
- You don't right? 
 - Of course not.

80
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,449
But does he have a girlfriend?

81
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,819
My brother? Nope. He probably won't for the rest of his life.

82
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,549
Why?

83
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,449
Don't tell him, okay?

84
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,289
He dated his first girlfriend from high school for about 10 years.

85
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,689
But she was really sick.

86
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:38,969
This already happened two years ago.

87
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:44,049
I don't think he wants to date anytime soon. He won't meet up with anyone.

88
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,589
By the way... is that why you told Luni that I'm two-faced?

89
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,279
How did you know that?

90
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,319
Come on, that means you bad mouthed me too.

91
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,109
Well, that's not bad mouthing you, but the facts... up to that point.

92
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:13,219
The facts? Who decided that was the truth?

93
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,919
I mean, think about it from my perspective! If you were the 20th one on the hook...

94
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
Hook? What is that about?

95
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,479
I just blurted out nonsense...

96
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,529
You're only honest when you accidentally blurt things out, huh? Tell me.

97
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,859
Tell me.

98
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,159
 Hey! 

99
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,779
Let's hide.

100
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:43,249
 Why? The picture came out good.  

101
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,119
It's so hot.

102
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,839
What is this? Why won't you say anything?

103
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,669
- You're nervous right? 
 -What?

104
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,799
Where are you going?

105
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,579
They left.

106
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,809
What?

107
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,439
♫  Even if it is a painful dream,   ♫

108
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:59,599
♫  Even if the time can't be known like that   ♫

109
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,079
♫  If it's you,   ♫

110
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,939
♫  and I just see you,   ♫

111
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:11,479
I won't be afraid anymore. ♫

112
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,289
   

113
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:27,869
Manager, why don't you date anyone?

114
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,689
Why the sudden question?

115
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,319
Nobody asks me to date them.

116
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,799
Liar.

117
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,869
Who would like someone like me?

118
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:46,769
Then if someone says they like you, will you date them?

119
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,579
No.

120
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,219
Why not?

121
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,379
- Because I'm scared? 
 - Of what?

122
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:57,759
If you like someone too much, you get scared of losing them.

123
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,349
 He thought he would definitely be marrying her. He never met anyone else. 

124
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:07,339
Then... are you never going to meet anyone?

125
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,849
Let's see... I don't know...

126
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:16,709
what it means to like someone, regardless of my fears.

127
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:23,399
The less you know about something, the scarier it is..., And you should get to know more about it.

128
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,959
If you're scared of the camera, you should take pictures.

129
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,479
You told me these things. So that's what I'm doing.

130
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,549
I did say that.

131
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,669
I must've said that to you because it's something I couldn't do.

132
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,379
How is that fair? If I'm doing it, you should do it too.

133
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:10,999
Do you think you'll be okay?

134
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,139
I can't be like this forever.

135
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:19,119
But watch carefully what I do.

136
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,789
 It's weird right? I'm supposed to be an idol.  

137
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,239
 It's okay.  

138
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,539
Head in.

139
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:04,399
I... I'm really going to speak informally now, okay?

140
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,779
You're already doing it. Why are you pretending like you can't?

141
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:11,399
That's true... Head in.

142
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,919
You go in first.

143
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,849
Okay, then.

144
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,209
Sleep well.

145
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,779
You too.

146
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,929
Hey, I got the pictures.

147
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,799
 Han Jung Woo? How? 

148
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,119
There's a guy that's really good.

149
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:41,789
-  Are you sure?  
 - I'm sure. It's a good one.

150
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,779
Just end them.

151
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,639
