1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,450
 

2
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,890
 All of this was only supposed to last one week. 

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,300
 My first love was over in seven days, just like that. 

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,330
 You went dark for a week. What did you do? 

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,350
I was just a little busy.

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,610
 Did you at least go on a trip somewhere? 

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,490
Yeah. I did.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,510
Do you think she saw this?

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,640
 

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,670
She'll see it when she sees it.

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,740
Don't go out of your way to show it to her.

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,600
She must feel so strange now.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
 

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,770
Of course she feels strange. It was a strange week.

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,920
 I didn't tell you because I thought you'd be alarmed. 

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,840
 Byul. 

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,020
 I'm happy I came here. 

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,880
Don't you miss Byul?

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
I do. I wish she'd come see us.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm sure she'll come when she can.

21
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,080
 Does reading that help you sleep? 

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,040
 Yes. 

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,250
 Maybe I should try it. 

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,730
What are you doing?

25
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,320
Jung Woo. What are you doing here?

26
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,510
Byul told me.

27
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,040
She said she was sorry and that I should come here.

28
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,560
No more lies, ok? I came here knowing exactly who you are.

29
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,660
Da Eun.

30
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,950
It's good, isn't it?

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,250
Is that why your face was so weird eating the ratatouille?

32
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,730
I hate eggplant so much!

33
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,450
That day... I ate my entire life's worth of eggplant!

34
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,340
I thought you looked like you wanted to die.

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,030
Then the couple photo shoot and the singing on stage, that was all a first for you?

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,000
My last performance was for my school's talent show.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,270
And the photo shoot? My graduation pictures.

38
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,320
That's amazing.

39
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,730
Um...

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,760
Then would you have accepted my confession, too?

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,320
Yes, I would have.

42
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,450
Aren't you mad? I lied to you.

43
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,290
Why would I be mad? I should've known.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,500
Now you know.

45
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,020
Right.

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,460
At least I know now.

47
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,060
I can keep getting to know you from now on.

48
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,040
Da Eun.

49
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,460
Da Eun!

50
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,710
Wake up!

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,390
It was a dream?

52
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,460
You fell asleep in the cafe!

53
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,740
I have to go back to sleep.

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,910
Why? What dream did you have?

55
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,490
Don't bother me. I have to sleep.

56
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,990
 ♫ Crush on me ♫ 

57
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
 ♫ Crush on me ♫ 

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,830
 ♫ Crush on me ♫ 

59
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,070
Do you want to stop here today?

60
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,020
Really? We don't have to finish today?

61
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,690
Yeah, we still have time. Do you want to get spicy rice cakes?

62
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,900
Yay! Spicy rice cakes -- that's a yes!

63
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,350
What's up with you Kim Byul? You seem like a different person today.

64
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,680
You're always the one saying we need to practice, practice, practice, and harrassing me.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Was I the one harrassing you?

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,090
What?

67
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,740
All those times I helped you with the choreography... Was that harrassing you?

68
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,050
Wow, what is with you today?

69
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,390
"Let's work hard together."

70
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,090
I hope you don't say things like that anymore.

71
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,330
Yeah, don't.

72
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,690
Hey. Hey!

73
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,790
 

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,430
What's that?

75
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,300
Secret.

76
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,560
Oh, that sparkle in your eye. You have someone, don't you?

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,610
No.

78
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,800
Do you? You do.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,610
Do you?

80
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,530
No? Yes?

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm Byul. Not Da Eun.

82
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,930
I know.

83
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,840
What were you looking at?

84
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,420
Huh? Oh. The accounts. I'm the owner after all. I have to work.

85
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,770
It looked like a picture.

86
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,750
Oh you saw it.

87
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,630
Were you waiting for me?

88
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,570
Yes.

89
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,170
Big sis! I found two cats.

90
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,770
Do you want one?

91
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,250
I don't collect those anymore.

92
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,070
Lately all the girls in my class wear these.

93
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,530
It's a wish ring. If you wear it, your wish comes true.

94
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,420
I guess I'll have to wear it everyday then.

95
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,070
Do you have a wish?

96
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,060
A wish?

97
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Yes, I have one.

98
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,860
 

99
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,740
 

100
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,760
It seems like they're dating after all, those two.

101
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,900
Jung Woo. How are you here?

102
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,630
Because I kept coming by.

103
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,990
At least you finally stopped by too.

104
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,750
I thought you'd come here.

105
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,410
We didn't tell lies here. Not here.

106
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,660
Now tell me.

107
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,110
Who are you?

108
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,350
 This is my story. 

109
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,040
 My story about how these seven surreal days interrupted my ordinary life. 

110
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,920
 

111
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,920

112
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,900

113
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,840

114
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,920


115
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,860

116
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,740


117
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,650
 

118
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,670
