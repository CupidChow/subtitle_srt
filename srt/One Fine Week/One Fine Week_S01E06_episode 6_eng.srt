1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,170
 Mission: Cook a delicious meal for Angels members 

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,400
 We have to go grocery shopping. Is there anything they can't eat? 

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,870
 - Could I make just one call?  
- They like spicy rice cakes. Oh, and I can't eat shiitake mush-- 

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,360
 - Thank you! 
- What's the chance they would choose shiitake mushrooms? 

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,050
 Kim Byul? She's not attractive. She's not someone I'll see long. 

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,920
 If you do that, you're going to get hurt- 

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,860
 I purposefully acted like I didn't like her. Byul is a good person. 

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,210
- Byul, how's Jung Woo?  
- He's two-faced.

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,250
Two-faced? Why? Did something happen?

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,180
He's the type who seduces girls but won't date them.

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,500
- Oh, really?  
- Isn't it unexpected?

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,450
- I found out.  
- Well flirting or dating or whatever, after all it's only a week, so...

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,150
Right, it's only a week, so it's okay.

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,260
But wasn't this program originally offered to you?

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,460
- I rejected it.  
- Why?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,150
I didn't know the co-star was Han Jung Woo at the time, obviously.

17
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,060
Ah, what a shame!

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,380
Byul, then is Jung Woo alone right now?

19
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,230
Yes, we've paused filming for a while.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,350
- You've paused filming?  
- Yes.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,380
Jung Woo, I've come to help.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,590
Luni?

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,820
Wow, look at the ingredients, they look really delicious! When did you prepare...

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,350
Oh... 
  Where's Byul? 

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,370
 She's at the hospital. I think she ate shiitake mushrooms by mistake. 

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,790
 What? Is going to the hospital necessary for something like that? 

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,890
 I guess she must be severely allergic to it. 

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,340
- Luni?  
- Yes?

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,320
Oh, it's nothing.

30
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,840
I would have done it if I'd known it was you. Originally I got the offer for this program.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,960
Oh, really? It's the first time I'm hearing that.

32
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,710
How's Byul? She's a little cold, right?

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,810
- I don't think so at all.  
- Really?

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,400
Ah, right. Towards men, she's a little different.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,060
- Um, Luni.  
- Yes?

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,280
- What is it you want to say?  
- What I want to say is...

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,030
- I guess there's nothing.  
- No! There is...

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,860
I'd like it if there weren't.

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,810
- Do you know Byul doesn't like you?  
- What?

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:52,940
Before, in the room, she told us... what was it? She said you were a very two-faced person.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,210
Byul did?

42
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,980
That's why I was asking, whether she's cold to you or not.

43
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,110
At least Byul is nice to you while you're filming. It's a relief.

44
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,660
Byul, I told you Roy and Dong Wook were dating, didn't I?

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,780
Roy's my friend, right? I told you, but why didn't you believe me? And now that it's finally in the news,

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,120
you want to talk? Why didn't you believe me?

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,670
How many times did I say it... Luni, where were you?

48
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,330
- I was going out for a moment, but I bumped into Jung Woo.  
- Did you guys talk?

49
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,020
- He kept making conversation.  
- What did he say?

50
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,910
He said he wanted to do the program with me originally, and it was a shame we couldn't.

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,980
Right? After all, it's a good year for you.

52
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,670
Byul, but you... should be careful with him.

53
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,370
Jung Woo didn't really speak very well of you.

54
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,170
Were you mean to him?

55
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,330
I must have been, even though I didn't know it.

56
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,910
 Kim Byul, you're very consistent. 

57
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:02,450
 You believe anything, like a fool, and you live with no tricks, working hard. 

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,030
Byul, when you're finished with that, are you going to take out every book and clean it all?

59
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,050
- Should I do something else?  
- Oh, no, that's not what I meant.

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,240
You put a lot of effort into everything you do, right?

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,050
I should. I'm slower than others...

62
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,820
 Luni, starting from this verse, I think the timing is a little slow... 

63
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,330
 Me? I don't think so. 

64
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,130
 Let's try doing it once more. 

65
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,110
 3, 4... one, two, three, four and 

66
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,730
 one, two, th-  here. Here your timing is- 

67
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,560
 - Hey! There's still a long time before we perform this on stage.  
- We should synchronize it while we can- 

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,250
 How can I synchronize with you? You have no other work and a lot of time in your hands, but 

69
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,860
 I, unlike you, have a lot of individual events scheduled, so it would be nice if you understood. 

70
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,320
 - CEO!  
- Oh, Luni!! 

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,590
 - How come you're here?  
- I was bored... 

72
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,940
 Okay, everyone! Since we've already started, 

73
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,970
 let's try doing it once until the end! Let's get into formation. 

74
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,720
 In any case, our Luni puts in the most effort. Learn from her, learn! 

75
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,730
So what if you're slow? Sit for a moment.

76
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,370
Byul, don't overdo it.

77
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,320
I think that's more than enough from you.

78
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,850
Here, at our place, don't work too hard.

79
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm going to go make macarons. Want to try making them with me?

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,200
 I've heard often that working hard alone isn't enough. 

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,160
Let's go.

82
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,150
 But "It's ok not to work too hard"... 

83
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,500
  "That's more than enough"... It's my first time hearing that. 

84
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,500
Hello, I'm Ha Neul! Today we came to have fun at Byul's filming site.

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,810
Okay, one, two, twinkle twinkle, we're the Angels!

86
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,610
Hi!

87
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,570
Byul, wake up! Okay, today, (drumroll) we have The Jung Woo here with us!

88
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,010
Yay! Say hi!

89
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,230
Hello, I'm Jung Woo from Endest.

90
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,840
 Now matter how his mood is, he's smiling a lot. 

91
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,120
 Right, this is a tv show. I, too, should hide my upset feelings, and do the show. 

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,140
Our angels are somewhere over there too, right?

93
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,010
- Hi, angels! 
-  

94
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,340
No, today the one who's doing the program with Jung Woo is not me, but Byul.

95
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,870
-  
-  
-  

96
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,170
What? You're telling me to do it?

97
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,560
- No, today just support Byul, please. Okay? We got this!
-  
-   
-  

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,070
- So, it's a shame but we'll end here today 
 - Give me that one moment.

99
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,900
Okay, everyone! This is our chance to ask Byul to act cute!

100
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,100
Ta-da!

101
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,940
 Byul is a little sick, but she's the nicest person in the world. 

102
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,520
 So, please, help us do this job well. 

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,690
 Okay! Since I've decided to do it, I'll do my best. 

104
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,090
Twinkle twinkle, we're Angels.

105
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,770
Twinkle twinkle, we're Angels.

106
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,780
Twinkle twinkle, we're Angels.

107
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,830
       

108
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,980
Wow, Byul is getting an explosive reaction!

109
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,220
Is this Byul's new twinkle twinkle trend?

110
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,920
Byul! You did so well today!

111
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,490
Well, I just did it because I was told to do, so what?

112
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,200
Thank you.

113
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,440
 It guess she's severely allergic. She won't be able to do any of this week's schedule. 

114
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,510
Wait.

115
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:46,150
Byul, these are mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms! Did you eat it? Quick, spit it out!

116
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,590
Are you crazy? You should be careful! Are you okay?

117
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,640
I'm okay, I didn't swallow it.

118
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,240
Hey, it could have become a huge problem.

119
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,950
Byul can't eat mushrooms?

120
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,310
Yes, she can't even have broth made with mushrooms, since the allergy's really serious.

121
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,540
Luni must not have known, since she saw them earlier in the kitchen.

122
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,960
- I didn't see them.  
- You did.

123
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,240
I forgot.

124
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,900
Luni, did you know this had mushrooms in it? How could you forget such a thing?

125
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,870
Don't forget it again.

126
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,830
I'll go make Byul's separately.

127
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:42,920
- What happened?  
- What are you talking about? Whatever. Stop.

128
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,780
 This person hates Kim Byul. 

129
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,720
 Enough to even let her eat food she shouldn't. 

130
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,550
Ha Neul, when you get back to the company office, tell them what happened here.

131
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,210
- Hey, Kim Byul.  
- When I get back after finishing the program, leave me alone.

132
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,700
I don't know what you've thought about me all this time, but stop bullying me.

133
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,820
 I don't know how often she's done things like this, but at least I'm pretty sure it's not just today. 

134
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,850
 

135
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,750
- You're taking a picture of me?  
- No.

136
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,570
 If you try using a film camera, you'll realize immediately what's precious to you. 

137
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,950
Since there's not much film, there'll be times when you think,

138
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,700
"OIh, I really should take a picture of this!"

139
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,110
