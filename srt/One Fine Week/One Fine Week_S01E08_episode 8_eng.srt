1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,260
Jung Woo, today we have a mission, righ-

2
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,190
Why are you being like this? As if you were thinking weird thoughts...

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,060
If you're thinking something, you naturally think others are thinking it too.

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,590
That's very true.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,960
You're having weird thoughts?!

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,240
Today, quite often.

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,550
The same thoughts as you, so...

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,900
No, I didn't have those thoughts...

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,080
If you say so.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,410
Today's mission.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,680
 Mission: Prepare a guerrilla duet performance. 

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,180
If it's a performance, is it on a stage?

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,060
Probably. Oh, among the songs I've written, there one we could sing together.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,970
Do you want to listen to it?

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,740
Did you two sleep here together?

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,460
Ji Han, wake up! Byul, wake up!

17
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,690
What is it with you two? What did you two do all night long? Explain, immediately.

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,170
Explain what? I can't remember. We just drank and sl-slept.

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,440
 Boss, why don't you have a girlfriend? 

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,290
Forget it. Byul, you tell me.

21
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,430
 If someone told you she liked you, would you date her? 

22
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,510
That's all, we just drank some beers.

23
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,610
These people. I know all about this!

24
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,730
When a grown up man and woman spend the night and drink alcohol together, then that means they're dating.

25
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,270
- Are you dating?  
- Dating, who's dating?

26
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,500
My ordinary brother, with Angels' main dancer?

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,100
Really? Are all the Angels' members going to come to our cafe now?

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,440
How old was Ha Neul? If we're the same age, we should become friends!

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,620
I can't talk her down, really...

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,260
Byul...

31
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,690
 

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,660
- What happened?  
- Byu- Byul...

33
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,460
I don't know how the picture was taken, but... why is our company admitting it?

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,940
The CEO thought if we acknowledged it, the topic could become more popular, and... we could also rise...

35
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,150
- Byul, it's okay. Things like this get forgotten immediately.  
- And what about her?

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,440
- Huh?  
- Da Eun.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,130
-  I'll help you. It's only a week, right?  
- Wasn't she helping me?  That person is in danger right now.

38
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,890
You know that Han Jung Woo has so many incidents with stalker fans.

39
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,200
What should we do with Da Eun, Byul?

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,930
Do you know what hotel room she's in?

41
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,880
 

42
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,970
 

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,780
Boss, would it be okay if I took the day off today?

44
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,970
Taking the day off is okay, but why?

45
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:01,060
I think I need to go to the hotel. We should switch again just for today. It's too dangerous for Da Eun to be there right now.

46
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,770
Then, let's go together.

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,730
- What?  
- Why do you want to go alone? It's okay if we go together, right? I'll go get the car.

48
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,440
Me too! I also want to go to Da Eun. Let's go together, Byul.

49
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,500
♫ Even if it's a dream... ♫ From here.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,930
Right.

51
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,930
It's a little difficult.

52
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,810
♫ For a moment... ♫

53
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,860
♫ Even if what's in front of you is just a dream... ♫

54
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,930
I really am in big trouble. What's this, it's not even a talent show retreat...

55
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,180
Is this really going to be okay?

56
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,180
What's this?

57
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,810
What on earth?

58
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,400
They gave me something like this, too?

59
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,530
Am I supposed to eat this?

60
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,930
They're giving me this?

61
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,620
Hey!

62
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,510
   

63
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,850
Don't look at it.

64
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,560
Byul, let's not look at these things. Let's go back to the cafe and look only at good things, okay?

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,530
I'll go throw these out.

66
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,130
Excuse me.

67
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,030
Why did you take these down?

68
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,060
- What?  
- What are you to keep being like this?

69
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,850
Hey, you! This fandom culture is terrible!

70
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,330
Because of kids like you, innocent fans like me are also blamed!

71
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,740
 Please, sign here. 

72
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,300
 - What's your name...  
 - Just do it, please. 

73
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,330
You...

74
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,720
I think I know who you are.

75
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,480
It's you, right? The fan who stalks Han Jung Woo.

76
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,100
Hey!

77
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,130
Let me go!  I'm going to report that you assaulted me.

78
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:55,060
- Assault? You're the one who's done worse. If anyone calls the police, it'll be me.  
- If this comes out on the internet, you're done for.

79
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,860
This is abuse of a fan, don't you know?

80
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,740
Don't worry. No one thinks you're a fan.

81
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,940
Let me go! Let me go!

82
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,300
- Yes, hello?  
- Hey, why don't you pick up your phone?

83
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,530
Oh, sorry. I had it on silent mode.

84
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,990
Are you crazy?

85
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,930
Why the insult, all of a sudden?

86
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,270
This picture, what is this! A picture of you and Kim Byul. It all over the news.

87
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,140
Right now, a picture of you kissing her is trending.

88
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,270
Kiss?

89
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,790
Wait a moment.

90
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,200
 

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,480
 Her agency liked it so they admitted it immediately. Listen carefully. You're shooting today, right? 

92
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,540
Turn to the camera, and personally, in front of everyone, say this:

93
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,180
"In this place, I want to be clear and precise."

94
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,040
"The picture that you are all seeing, that is all staged."

95
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,180
"This is all false." Say that, understood?

96
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,540
Excuse me, I think you have to come out quickly.

97
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,040
Please, let her go, Byul. We'll take care of it.

98
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,330
No, she's going to run away again! Please call the police.

99
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,380
Your program is all done. I'm going to post this all over the internet.

100
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,840
- Quick, let go! Really, let her go, quickly!  
- No, we can't let her run away!

101
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,510
Goodness, why are you so strong?

102
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,200
Jung Woo!

103
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,910
Please convince Byul. If she does this, our program will really be in trouble.

104
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,140
You don't know what to do, either. I said I can't!  Let me go, quick.

105
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,210
 Why should bad people suffer no consequences, while you have a hard time because of them? 

106
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,640
 That girl, she came to find me at the office. 

107
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,440
 Don't make a big thing of it. Are you really going to report it? 

108
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,400
- Please, call the police.  
- What?

109
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,750
Please call them. I will explain.

110
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,540
- You don't know what kind of person she is.
 - Let me go!

111
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,940
- Let me go, let me go! 
- Just stay still. Call the police quickly.

112
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,400
- It's Han Jung Woo. 
- It's really him.

113
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,270
- It's him. 
- Let's see.

114
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,110
Wow, really, it's really him.

115
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,920
What's he doing?

116
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,980
Hello, my name is Han Jung Woo.

117
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,170
She's Kim Byul. They're dating, right?

118
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,050
What, really?

119
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,510
They're really dating.

120
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,480
There was a picture of them kissing...

121
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,450
- Amazing.  
- But I heard Han Jung Woo denied it.

122
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,150
I want to borrow this stage to say something to all of you.

123
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:45,410
- The picture and articles you all saw yesterday and today...
-  "It's all false"  -
- They're all true.

124
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,050
Let's go. You can do it.

125
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,010
We practiced, didn't we?

126
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,930
Come out when you're ready.

127
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:34,110
♫ I lost a watch that was going to my heart. ♫

128
