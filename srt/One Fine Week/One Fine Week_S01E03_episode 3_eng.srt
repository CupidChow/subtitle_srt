1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,510
 Mission: Take a special couple photoshoot. 

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,740
What is this? Couple photos?

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:15,090
 A photo session? They want me, who ruined all my photos from childhood to graduation, to do a photo session? 

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,640
- Sorry... for yesterday.
- Huh?

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,250
Yesterday night. The suitcase.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,800
Oh, it's okay. I'm the one that interrupted your rest.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,240
It wasn't something you could help.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm a little sensitive at night...

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,040
It's okay. If I were sleeping and someone suddenly woke me up...

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,340
Byul, long time no see.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,620
- Hello.  
-Huh?  
Who is this person? 

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,470
- Isn't this the third time we're working together? 
-  The photographer? 

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,870
The other time I took the photos of your album jacket... 
-  Are we close? 

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,060
... was about three months ago, I think.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,870
Ah, have you been well?

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:03,030
Yes, I've been well, of course. But I didn't think you were the type to do a dating reality show.

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,360
Ah, it just ended up like this...

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,630
Why are you so awkward? Is it because Jung Woo is here?

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,000
All right! For now let's start shooting. Let's start with Byul's individual shots.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,770
 Individual shots?! 

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,870
- You're not Da Eun, right? 
- What do you mean?

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,670
Da Eun is someone who would rather eat pigeons than eggplant.

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,870
And this. How would someone not recognize the birthday present they bought?

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,110
- You... you're Kim Byul from Angels, right?
- No.

25
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,480
You're exactly the same as on TV! You really are Kim Byul! Amazing!

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,780
Be quiet!

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,650
I thought you looked a lot like Da Eun, but... why are you here?

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,920
- Please, keep it secret.  
- Of course!

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,620
On my school trip, I'm dancing an Angels dance. It's the song Heaven. Do you know it?

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,020
What are you doing? Why are you like this today? Do you want to make all the staff wait for you?

31
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,300
Sorry...

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,820
Let's leave it here.

33
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,170
Today's really been hard. Please let there not be any more people calling my name...

34
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,080
Byul! I'm here! Have you been well?

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,590
-  Unni? Who? 
- The roads were so congested!

36
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,980
Let's stay still. Stay still. Just still...

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,650
Let's see, let's see. Oh, you're so pretty... Huh?

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,420
Byul, you got a hair piece?

39
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,380
This hair. It has extensions.

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,170
Ah, I was bored so I tried cutting it... but since it didn't suit me, I got my old style back.

41
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,800
Really? I thought you were trying to grow it out...

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Right?

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,460
You've changed your eyebrow shape too?

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,650
The texture is also different.There's no way... 
  - This is the end for me... 

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,450
Wait...

46
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,580
 This time, I'm really done for. I'm sorry, manager! 

47
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,800
If normal to look a little different when you're tired. Why are you nagging her with such trivial things?

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,420
Jung Woo is waiting outside, help him first. I have to talk with her for a moment.

49
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,020
Okay.

50
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,940
Why don't you fool us better?

51
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,570
What?

52
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,700
I'm at the cafe!

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,350
I'm eating cake. Show you what? I mean--

54
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,010
My bag! What should I do?! Oh no!

55
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,100
- Sorry... 
 -Ah, forget it! Do you know how much this costs?

56
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,060
I imagine it costs more than your monthly wage.

57
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,490
I'll pay for it.

58
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,820
How would I believe that? Ah, forget it. Give me your phone number.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,520
- Number? 
 -Yes, give me your phone number.

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,440
I don't think I can give you my number...

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,860
Then tell me your name, or show me some ID.

62
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,330
I don't think I can give you that either.

63
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,140
You can't? Then you'll have to give me your face.

64
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,830
Please, stop!

65
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,020
Look, it's Kim Byul!

66
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,440
- Is there a problem? 
 -Are you the owner? Did you see that girl?

67
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,330
Yes, I saw it all.  
-You know, then.

68
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,330
- Please compensate me for my bag. 
 - I saw you harassing my part-time worker.

69
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,800
Are you taking your part-time worker's side because you're the owner? How can one believe the what you saw?

70
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,030
Hello. I'm a student who was passing by.

71
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,320
I just saw that person smacking some girl. Is she okay?

72
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,780
What, what is this...

73
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,470
It's okay if you don't compensate us for the chair.

74
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,720
Ah, really, this is outrageous...

75
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,840
Are you all right?

76
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,550
Are you okay?

77
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,080
- I'm okay.  
-Da Eun, are you okay?

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,890
What should we do?

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,640
Why don't you fool us a little better?

80
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,690
It's really obvious that you're not close with Jung Woo. This will be broadcasted, at least try pretending you're close.

81
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,930
It's hard, right? Tonight the shoot today, how about going for a drink?

82
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,090
I can't make outside appointments during the filming period. Sorry.

83
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,430
Don't worry. I already spoke to the  producer.

84
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,490
Then... will everyone be coming?

85
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,810
No, just the two of us.

86
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,440
- The two of us?  
 - Yes, come out separately.

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,380
Shouldn't you have understood already? Just the two of us.

88
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,350
I'm sorry, but...  
 -I heard you don't have much time until the end of your contract. Your CEO,

89
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,400
he keeps asking me what he should do with you. It puts me in a difficult place.

90
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,120
You don't want to be kicked out, right?

91
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,160
Excuse me, photographer.

92
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,380
- When am I going to do my personal shoot?  
- Right, right. Let's go, Jung Woo.

93
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,670
See you later.

94
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,490
Okay, okay. Good.

95
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,720
An A-lister isn't an A-lister for no reason, huh?

96
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,850
- Do you like what you got?
  -Yes, I like it. Let's go with this.

97
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,060
Then, how about going for a drink with me in a while?

98
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,480
What on earth? No, I'm busy. Let's get close some other day.

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,390
But when you told Byul to see you later separately you seemed to have a lot of time.

100
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,010
Hey, what are you saying?

101
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,730
- Why are you so surprised?  
- Because you're talking gibberish!

102
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,130
Let's go out separately. Let's see each other alone. Didn't you say that?

103
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,820
At the dressing room you tried so hard to persuade her...

104
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,270
Should I say more? The contract renewal, being kicked out of the company...

105
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,290
Hey, when did I say that?

106
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,700
You, tell them! Did I say that?

107
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,980
Yes, you did.

108
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,830
Hey, no I didn't!

109
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,370
These people have gone collectively crazy!

110
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,450
You, why do you keep talking formally to Da Eun?

111
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,470
What? Oh... well, I've been pretty rude to her all this time. She is my elder after all.

112
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,250
Now, suddenly?

113
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,080
So before, why did you run so urgently to Da Eun?

114
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,570
I ran? I didn't run! I just...

115
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,400
Kim Byul. Whose name is this?

116
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,560
Oh? Uh... who's this?

117
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,630
Yoo Ari, stop lying.

118
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,820
When you lie your pupils shake like crazy, you know?

119
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,190
- But I promised...  
- Promised?

120
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,790
The thing is...

121
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,560
 

122
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,780
I heard.

123
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm sorry. I didn't tell you because I thought you'd be surprised.

124
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,250
But, how can something like this happen?

125
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,390
It's not that I wanted to lie...

126
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,030
I mean, Da Eun being an idol?

127
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,050
Is that even possible, that clumsy girl? I'm very worried!

128
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,840
- Are you not mad?  
- What? Why would I be mad?

129
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,960
Well, you both had your own circumstances, and you still came to the cafe.

130
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,330
Then, it's okay if I keep talking to you informally, like with Da Eun, right?

131
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,940
Please, speak comfortably.

132
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,110
Okay.

133
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,670
What happened before... Are you okay?

134
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,920
Yes, I'm okay as long as I'm not photographed.

135
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,290
It's weird, right? Being an idol...

136
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,970
It's okay, what's weird?

137
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,050
- Why did he do that?  
- I don't know, I think they fought... 
- Should it not be broadcast?

138
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,390
- No way.  
- Would it be ok to broadcast? 
- What should we do...

139
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,490
Um... Thank you for earlier.

140
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,990
Are you okay?

141
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,930
 Why are you doing this to me? 

142
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,970
 What's wrong? I'm just your fan. 

143
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,720
Um... are you ok?

144
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,750
- Hey.
  - Don't come closer.

145
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,850
No.

146
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,730
Don't leave.

148
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:46,120
Do you want to go out? It's okay as long as there's no people, right?

149
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,720
Do you know a place?

150
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,500
- You bought a lot.  
- It looks good, right?

151
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,280
We're at a convenience store.

152
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,960
There's a bigger convenience store nearby, so this one has no clients. An unfortunate convenience store, right?

153
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,230
How did you know, that there was an unfortunate convenience store here?

154
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,310
I saw it on my way to the hotel. Since I like convenience stores, so I remember where they are.

155
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,170
Should I say... it's a cheap hobby.

156
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,380
You can also say it's a practical one.

157
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,520
- You're not asking?  
- Asking what?

158
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,360
Before. In the dressing room.

159
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,430
Shouldn't people be allowed to talk about things when they want to?

160
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,970
Yes. Do you do idol scandals, too?

161
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,370
Who? One or two?

162
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,250
- Han Jung Woo. 
- Wow, Han Jung Woo? You have something?

163
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,510
I think it will happen, sooner or later.

164
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,680
- What level should we make it?  
- The more the better. You do this kind of thing, too?

165
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,080
Are you crazy? Do you think I run after kids?

166
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,110
Then, why?

167
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,100
I have my reasons. I'm going to help educate him.

168
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,850
Wait for the pictures. I'll send them to you as soon as I take them.

169
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,600
