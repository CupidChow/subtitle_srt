1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,810
Everyone, the pictures and articles you've seen

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,560
today and yesterday... are all true.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,220
 Everything is going to end in two days. 

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,520
And Jung Woo doesn't know.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,060
Sorry. I should have told you first.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,230
No, that's not it. Your company's definitely going to get angry. And your image...

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,230
Those thoughts...

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,280
didn't occur to me at all.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,130
That's how special this shooting has been for me.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,280
No matter how special it is, there's only two days left of shooting.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,990
There's two days left for shooting...

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,540
not two days left of us, right?

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,620
 It was then I thought... Was there a way we could really be able to be together? 

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,770
 That's what I thought. 

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,250
Later, for a moment,

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,860
can you come to my room?

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,180
Those types of people need to be caught immediately.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,690
They go messing around with food, and yet they call themselves fans?

19
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,800
They call themselves fans? Those people are just criminals!

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,410
Calm down. That's why they caught her, no?

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
Why is she so sensitive about it?

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,820
Sometimes, our relatives ask whether she follows idols or does sketchy things.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,100
I even donate in their name!

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,830
Um... it's very late, but... how about we spend one night here and then leave tomorrow?

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,680
Oh, good idea!

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,050
Brother, 'staycations' are the trend these days. Let's spend the night here!

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,790
Okay!

28
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,570
Then, let's stay one night.

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,550
 Today, here, I will confess. 

30
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm really not Kim Byul but Jung Da Eun instead. I'm just a physical education college student, but

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,700
things just happened to end up like this somehow...

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm really sorry for lying to you, but-

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,000
What should I do?

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,800
Ta-da!

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,740
What?! How did you come here?

36
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,050
I'm just here.

37
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,780
What on earth?

38
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,900
Da Eun!

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,970
With the hair and the makeup, you look amazing. Can't you come like this to the cafe?

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,420
Forget that, how did you come here?

41
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,950
Ah, what should I do?

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,230
For now, go in, quickly, go in!

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,090
Were you waiting?

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,110
Wow, Han Jung Woo.

45
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,130
Sorry, but... let's talk tomorrow.

46
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,460
Oh... why?

47
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm feeling a little sick. I think I need to rest a little.

48
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,370
What hurts?

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,340
I think it must be a cold.

50
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,960
Leave before you get it too. I'll go sleep after taking some medicine.

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
Should I go buy medicine for you?

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,890
No, just leave.

53
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,780
I think I'll heal if I'm alone. Go, go, I think I'll be okay.

54
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,980
Okay, then...

55
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,000
-Is there anyone here?  
-No, the shampoo must have fallen by itself.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,700
-Go.  
-Could it be... that girl...

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,230
No, you saw the police take her just a while ago!

58
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,960
See? The shampoo fell by itself. Quickly go, go.

59
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,090
Hey!

60
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,660
What are you two? Are you in a relationship where if you catch a cold he would catch it too?

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,880
Thank you! Thanks to you I had to lie again. I said I wouldn't again...

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,900
Should I go call him?

63
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,510
Hey!

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,050
Geez, this girl.

65
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,090
Why is she taking so long?

66
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,240
Manager.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,600
Yes?

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,480
I... will go often. To the cafe.

69
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,500
Oh, right. If you can, come.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,580
It'll be hard because you'll be busy, but...

71
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,040
I'll go next week.

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,130
Sure, we'll see if that works for you then...

73
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,020
Instead of seeing if it works then... we can just agree on a time right now.

74
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,170
But if we agree on a time,

75
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,390
I'll be waiting for you.

76
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,490
Boss...

77
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,640
Byul,

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,950
it was so much fun having you here.

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,650
But... since you have to go back...

80
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,880
 If I like her too much, I'm afraid I'd lose her. 

81
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,110
Take care over there.

82
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,300
I... had a lot of fun.

83
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,240
Be happy.

84
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,690
 A film camera? 

85
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,520
 -Yes, try taking some pictures!  
-I'm going to make macarons. Do you want to make them together? 

86
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,270
 If liking someone feels like this... 

87
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,860
 I never before, even for a moment, 

88
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,000
 had liked anyone. 

89
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,860
I like you.

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,390
Mission: Go together to a place that holds significance to one of you.

91
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,530
The convenience store, huh? Is this your memorable place?

92
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,600
Life is unpredictable, right?

93
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,970
I thought we'd go somewhere like your school.

94
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,010
I barely ever went to school...

95
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,660
Then... your practice room?

96
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,920
I still go there a lot so it doesn't count as a place in my memories.

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,810
That's why, at best, this is your memorable place?

98
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,750
What do you mean, at best? For me, it's a very important place.

99
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,520
I like everything about this place.

100
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,950
I liked the food I ate here, and I liked the conversation I had here.

101
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,380
And I liked the person I was with, too.

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,470
Do you like convenience stores, too?

103
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:41,090
 The one who liked convenience stores was me. Not Kim Byul, but the real me. 

104
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,850
No. I don't like convenience stores.

105
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,670
I like hotel restaurants.

106
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:52,200
Just kidding. Of course I like convenience stores. I've always been a practical person.

107
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,870
I think it's good to be practical.

108
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,460
 The one Jung Woo really likes may not be Kim Byul, right? 

109
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,960
 Would it be okay if I were a little braver? 

110
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,200
Don't drink.

111
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,370
Why?

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,340
I have something to tell you, later.

113
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,240
Are you not going to tell me? You even told me not to drink...

114
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,900
 Now I really have to tell him. 

115
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,990
Then, should I say something first?

116
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,740
 My name is Jang Da Eun. I'm not Kim Byul. 

117
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,850
Byul!

118
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,390
Do you want to date me?

119
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,540
What?

120
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,170
It feels a little late, but...

121
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,220
 But I'm still Kim Byul! Things are going out of order. 

122
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,610
- What's your answer?  
-Wait.

123
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,780
This is not the right order.

124
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,800
Then I'll change the question.

125
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,630
Do you want to go see a movie with me next week?

126
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,630
No, not that order...

127
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,670
I told you I had something to tell you, a moment ago. I have do that first.

128
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,570
For now, I'm really sorry.

129
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,290
Don't be too surprised.

130
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,580
What is it?

131
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,150
 Something like a stand-in? So, what would I have to do? 

132
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,560
 You should become Kim Byul, of course. 

133
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,850
I think you're going to get mad.

134
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,730
Why would I get mad?

135
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
-I, actually... 
-Byul!

136
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,620
So you were here! It took me a while to find you.

137
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,500
Tomorrow is the last day, after all. I came to help you pack your stuff.

138
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,490
Hello, Jung Woo.

139
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,740
Byul, I was so surprised when I saw those articles. The agency became chaos.

140
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,130
You should have at least told me beforehand.

141
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,790
 I'm putting us in your care. No matter what, don't be found out! 

142
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,680
 Since I've decided to do it, I'll do it well. 

143
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,340
I'm sorry, manager.

144
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,790
Is it okay if I go back in after talking here for a moment?

145
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,840
Let's just go together.

146
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,690
Wait one moment.

147
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,880
Just a moment is enough.

148
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,690
Okay, then...

149
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,810
I'll be there.

150
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,430
Before... what were you about to say?

151
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,800
I wanted to say thank you for this week.

152
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,210
What?

153
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,130
We met through work, but you treated me like this wasn't just for work.

154
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,490
I'd completely forgotten, that this was work.

155
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,340
Byul-

156
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,500
I'll head in first.

157
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,990
We weren't just working, right?

158
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,170
We were real.

159
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
Weren't we?

160
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,790
Why are you crying?

161
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,240
Why are you lying?

162
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,040
The reason why you're lying right now,

163
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,930
at least tell me that.

164
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,200
Jung Woo. What will you do when we leave?

165
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,900
What do you mean, what will I do?

166
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,990
When the program is finished, what will you do when we leave.

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,830
I guess I'll practice and prepare for the album.

168
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,860
And?

169
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,650
I'll perform and I'll shoot. Just the same as you.

170
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,600
But why is that important, right now?

171
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,570
That.

172
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,220
What?

173
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,650
That's the reason I'm leaving.

174
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,290
Kim Byul...

175
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,260
And that, also.

176
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,220
I trust that you'll keep your promise...

177
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,380
until the very end.

178
00:12:53,590 --> 00:13:01,900


179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,050
 

180
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,170
