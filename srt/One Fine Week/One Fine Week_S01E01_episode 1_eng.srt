1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430


2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,210
 This is the story of 7 surreal days that interrupted my normal life. 

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,990
 

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,550
Life is unfair!

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,190
 My name is Jung Da Eun. I work part-time at a cafe. 

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,060
Because of who today?

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,570
Her.  She was born 18 years ago, just like me, and grew up eating the same food.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,880
Why is she an idol star and I'm just a high school nothing?

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,680
If she's an idol at 18, she must have been training from a very young age.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,150
She lost her youth. She might even be jealous of you.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,130
No way.

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,340
While I'm stuck in the standing section, she's up on stage,

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,630
and while I save money for bus fares, she's on a plane to natural hot springs.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,630
Do you have to be on a stage to sing?

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,290
 Nowadays it's all about the solo corner karaoke. Singing whatever and whenever I want is what's fun. 

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,950
 As for natural hot springs? The best ones are the ones in your neighborhood. 

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,490
 Taking a plane to get there would be more exhausting. 

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,220
Fine, what about this? Her closest guy friend is Han Jung Woo from Endest.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,020
Do you have any friends this impressive?

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,960
 I have a lot of amazing friends. 

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,940
This one... is a cat.

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,300
How do you know that?

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,250
How did you know?!

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,780
Wait. Were you able to see it?

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,620
How could you compare a little kid in front of the shop to Han Jung Woo from Endest?

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,260
They're not that different.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,240
You startled me!

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,260
Wow, that's how you'll treat your heavenly older brother?

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,640
Heavenly? Who can tell if you're the owner or a part-timer?

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,790
 Even though I'm living a normal, everyday life with nothing very special about it... 

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,350
 I can say that I am sufficiently happy with it. 

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,930
Hello, this is Cafe Decoa.

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,390
This is Sky Entertainment. Do you deliver?

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,580
Yes. We deliver.

35
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,660
If that's the case, one moment please.

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,800
Guys, coffee!

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,480
- I want mocha with a  lot of syrup.
- A latte with a lot of foam.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,440
Cold brew for me.

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,110
- Hey Byul, what about you?
- I'm okay.

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,720
 My name is Kim Byul. I debuted as an idol 5 years ago. 

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,980
♫  The awkward gaze, the unfamiliar expression that I know  ♫

42
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,410
♫  It's the sign; it's not a fake love  ♫

43
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,480
Byul and Luni's contracts are almost up, right?

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,260
Yes. But they're both going to continue as far as I kn--

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,480
Hasn't Byul lost a lot of popularity lately?

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,920
Not at all. Byul has always had her core devoted fans.

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,400
- Chulgu. 
 - Yes?

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,570
Let's put in Minnie instead of Byul.

49
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,990
They're not like water purifying filters.

50
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,180
You can't just change them as the season changes because it pleases you.

51
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,700
A CEO can do exactly as he pleases.

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,010
But still...

53
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,580
How could you want to replace the main dancer of Angels with a middle school kid?

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,740
That middle schooler is actually already famous for being an amazing beauty.

55
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,330
And the main dancer is famous for being expressionless and rude.

56
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,680
You know the program that Byul agreed to do? A dating reality show.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,840
The co-star was announced today!

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,560
It's probably a rookie or someone from a group that's not popular anymore.

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,500
 It's Han Jung Woo. Member of Endest, who made first place on music charts and the Oricon charts, but unfortunately only third on the Billboard charts. 

60
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,610
 The same Han Jung Woo who just accepted the main role in a drama that is currently on air! 

61
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,640
Wow, why are things working out this way?

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,770
Fine. Let's see how that goes, and then I'll think about it.

63
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,200
♫  Crush on me  ♫

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,890
- Sir, I'm going to make the delivery.
- Okay, go ahead.

65
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,930
If I were an idol, I would have made so much more money than you.

66
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,030
Cut it out.

67
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,030
Do you know how hard it is for them? They have to exercise every day, get ranked all the time and can't eat properly either.

68
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,630
That's right. Even if they offered it to me I couldn't do it.

69
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,700
What? What did you just say?

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,160
I don't think I can do it. The reality show.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,340
Does that even make sense? This is not a joke.

72
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,390
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity! An opportunity!

73
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,880
I think you're being like this because you don't understand the situation- give me a moment, Hello?

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,390
Hi. I'm almost there with your coffee. Where should I go?

75
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,580
I'll go outside.

76
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,660
I'll be back soon.

77
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,820
Let's go together. I want to get some fresh air.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,610
Okay. Let's talk about it outside.

79
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,610
Hey! Take pictures! It's Kim Byul.

80
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,250
Byul! Kim Byul!

81
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,050
- Excuse us.
- Why are you so pretty?

82
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,710
- Excuse us. 
- Do you remember me?

83
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,170
- Come on out!
- Byul!

84
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,810
- Excuse us. Thank you!
- Byul!

85
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,630
- Byul!
- Do you remember me?

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,500
There are people out there who are jealous of my "special" life.

87
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,970
But me? There are times I want to escape

88
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,120
from all of these things.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,260
- Stop! Stop!
- Byul!

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,560
- Byul!
- Byul, are you sick?

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,320
By any chance, did you have a panic attack?

92
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,730
Why don't you head inside first? I'll give it some more thought.

93
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,260
Wow, this is really a big problem.

94
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,760
She really needs to do that program. What should I do? I can't send her in that state either.

95
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,470
Oh right, I forgot.

96
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,490
I'm sorry. Where are you?

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,700
Hi, I'm here with your coffee.

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,380
Yes. How much is it?

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,520
$16.

100
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,600
 What is this? Am I seeing things? 

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,500
 No, it's right. They're the same. 

102
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,530
She looks just like Byul without makeup.

103
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,390
 Who is this? Wait. 

104
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,950
 That's not important right now. 

105
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,130
Excuse me, I have a favor to ask.

106
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,860
What?

107
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,570
Byul, Byul.

108
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,770
I found something.

109
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,400
What?

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,470
Please come inside.

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,050
What's this?

112
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,760
Who is she?

113
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,930
Don't you know Byul, from Angels?

114
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,090
I don't really watch TV, so...

115
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,970
So, you want me to go on the program that Kim Byul was supposed to appear on instead?

116
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,110
- Is that right?
- Yes. It's just for 7 days.

117
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,730
Like an understudy?

118
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,820
That's right. Just for 7 days.

119
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,420
But I'm just an athletics major who doesn't know anything.

120
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,450
You just need to stay at a hotel for a week.

121
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,700
At a hotel? Why would I stay at a hotel?

122
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,890
No, no, no, no. It's nothing like that. It's for filming.

123
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,870
A popular dating reality program.

124
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,470
No. But, wait a minute.

125
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,800
But isn't that too... dangerous?

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Won't we get into big trouble if we get caught?

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,790
Why would we do such a dangerous—

128
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,510
Because I'm sick.

129
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,370
What?

130
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,210
I'm sick, so I don't think I will be able to do the filming.

131
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,310
Well, that is ... kind of sad. But still, this is a little...

132
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,340
If I don't participate in this show, I could get kicked out of the Angels.

133
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,570
The CEO doesn't really like me.

134
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,630
I know it's a difficult request...but I have to make it.

135
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,340
We beg you.

136
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,670
Why are you being like this?

137
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,580
I will help you.

138
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,620
It's only for a week, right?

139
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,980
Really? 
Yes, it's just one week.

140
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,730
Thank you. Thank you.

141
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,510
But, what exactly do I need to do?

142
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,870
Hello!

143
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,690
Yes, hello!

144
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,790
 This is the story of 7 surreal days 

145
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,590
  that interrupted my normal life. 

146
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,440


147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,510
