1
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,049
Who is it?

2
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:22,029
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Miss Luni?

3
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,889
- What brings you here? 
 - I have a present for you. Ta-da!

4
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,819
 Mission - Make a delicious meal for the members of Angels 

5
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,959
Oh, a mission. Thank you.

6
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:37,649
Wait! If you're free, why don't we chat for a bit?

7
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,399
I thought... we had agreed not to film inside the rooms.

8
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,729
Oh, if that's the case. You already filmed me giving him the mission card right? We'll be out after a quick chat.

9
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:55,669
It's so nice in here. The bookshelf is pretty too.

10
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:59,219
Do you have something to say to me?

11
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,739
I just wanted to chat with you now, because  I didn't think I'd get the chance to when we film later.

12
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,789
Did you sleep on the sofa?

13
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:21,239
Oh, yes. It's my personal preference.

14
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,409
There's a terrace? How pretty!

15
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,769
Yes, the terrace is pretty. It's pretty,

16
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,999
but I want to show you the bathroom. 
 - What?

17
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:38,429
The bathroom is actually a bit prettier than the terrace, so I want to show that to you.

18
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,429
- I see...
 - Let's go.

19
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,269
Jeez, that was close one...

20
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:51,989
- Who? 
 - What do you mean who? It's me, pretty Ha Neul.

21
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:57,089
Oh, Ha Neul. Pretty Ha Neul... You're here?

22
00:01:57,089 --> 00:02:01,369
Where were you? Didn't you know we're featured in the next mission?

23
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,759
The crew left because you weren't here. I wanted to film the surprise!

24
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,839
You get to do whatever you please!

25
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,679
Byul, you look a bit different today.

26
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:30,359
- Why do you seem like a different person? 
 - What are you talking about?

27
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,859
- Is it because you didn't do your hair? 
 - I actually didn't wash it...

28
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:38,489
- Hey! Is it because it's oily? Why didn't you wash it? 
 - I was feeling lazy.

29
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,499
You normally wash up 5 times a day. Why aren't you being clean today?

30
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,539
Byul, you don't have anything going on with Jung Woo right?

31
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:50,519
Have anything? Like what?

32
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,259
I'm close to Jun Beom from Endest, and he told me to be careful of Jung Woo.

33
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,079
Be careful of what?

34
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,569
Byul, look at Jung Woo. He seems like he'd be nice and proper, right?

35
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,179
Apparently, he's great at keeping girls on the hook.

36
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:10,309
He's especially good to every one, so no girls suspect that they're being played.

37
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:14,199
But then, later on, you find out you're number 20 on the waiting list.

38
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,199
Why would he do that with 20 people?

39
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,179
Why else? Isn't it to hold hands and sleep together?

40
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:24,869
He doesn't seem like that type. And how could he right now? We're filming.

41
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:28,969
Did he not come over for no reason while you guys weren't filming? Maybe at night?

42
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:33,869
 Are you sleeping? Can you come to my room for a bit? 

43
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:36,799
So he has? Wow, he's really a player.

44
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,419
Byul, you're going to get backstabbed like that.

45
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,569
I'm telling you this because I know you're dense.

46
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,659
Don't give you heart to him. Don't be one of his fish in the sea.

47
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,619
 You must feel at ease since your members are here. 

48
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:53,929
Oh, yes.

49
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:58,419
I couldn't be more at ease. 
  Let's not believe in weird rumors. 

50
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,149
 It's not like I experienced that myself.  

51
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:05,159
Oh, right. We have to go grocery shopping. What do your members like?

52
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,389
They'll eat anything.

53
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,949
- Do they not have any allergies?
 - Allergies?

54
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:23,019
Wait, my stomach really hurts right now.

55
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,589
Sorry, I'll be right back.

56
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,889
I'm really sorry, but could I just make one call?

57
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,179
Thank you.

58
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,839
- Hello? 
 -  Oh, thank goodness.  

59
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,239
I'm... it's me.

60
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:57,579
- What's wrong? 
 - It's an emergency, so I'll just get to the point.

61
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,819
 Are your members allergic to anything? What do they like to eat?  
 - 2 Americanos please.

62
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,669
 Yes. 

63
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,209
- They like spicy rice cakes.  
 - Okay, thanks!

64
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:10,359
I can't eat Shiitake mushro...

65
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,979
Out of all things to buy, they wouldn't get Shiittake mushrooms, right? 
  Shiitake Mushrooms  

66
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:29,009
I think we have all the materials for spicy rice cake. Do you like seafood, like fish?

67
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:35,309
 Don't be a fish.  
 I'm not really feeling fish today.

68
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:44,399
- Can you watch this for a bit? I need to use the restroom. 
 - Sure.

69
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,149
What's wrong? I can't call you for long.

70
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,489
 How is she? Byul? 

71
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,419
You called to ask me that?

72
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,699
Do I need to say things when I'm alone too?

73
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,609
Oh... This is convenient to eat because it's small,

74
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,169
and this one... seems like it would have a nice texture.

75
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,619
I need to use the restroom...

76
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,669
Huh? What do you mean how is it?

77
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,809
I can't talk for long. Kim Byul?

78
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:46,959
I'm just pretending to be good to her because I'm filming.

79
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,119
She's a little annoying because she's a bit of a meddler.

80
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,899
 I'll stay here until you fall asleep. 

81
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:57,169
 Should we go outside? Is it okay if there's no other people? 

82
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,959
Huh?

83
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,169
Why would we date? She doesn't have any appeal.

84
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,759
We won't be meeting long after we film anyway.

85
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,659
I need to hang up now. Don't call me.

86
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,909
If it's difficult, you can stop. I can do it.

87
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,409
It's fine, I can do it myself.

88
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,149
- If  you do that, you'll get hurt. 
 - I'm not getting hurt right now.

89
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:46,759
I feel like you will soon... your technique is asking for you to get hurt.

90
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,719
Curl your fingers like this and try it.

91
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,509
It doesn't work as well.

92
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,529
- No, if you do that you'll get hu- 
 - Ouch!

93
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,869
I told you you'd get hurt!

94
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,579
I'm heading to my room.

95
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,729
Wait.

96
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,789
- Something's wrong right? Something bad. 
 - No.

97
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,299
- There is. 
 - There isn't.

98
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:35,509
You're not even looking at me. You have to tell me for me to know.

99
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:42,529
It's nothing. Can I go to my room now? This hurts.

100
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:01,739
- You were both here? 
 - Why are you coming up alone?

101
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:05,259
I came to change.

102
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:13,299
Byul, what do you think of Jung Woo?

103
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,409
Well, he's kind and has good manners...

104
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:24,399
and two-faced... so scary.

105
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:29,539
Manager, Jun Beom keeps calling me.

106
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,009
 How is she, Byul? 

107
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,799
This time, I think he's interested in Byul.

108
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,419
-  Yeah, bring her out next time.   
- I intentionally tried to make it sound like I don't like her,

109
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,399
 Oh my god, she's hella cute.  

110
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,829
but I'm still kind of worried.

111
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:51,239
Jung Woo! I heard you're filming something with Kim Byul of Angels?

112
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:56,809
Byul is a good person. Can you try stopping him?

113
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:05,299
