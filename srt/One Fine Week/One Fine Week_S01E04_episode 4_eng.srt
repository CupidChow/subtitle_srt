1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,900
 If my friends knew, how surprised would they be? 

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,230
What is it?

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,660
 No, they wouldn't believe me in the first place. 

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,220
- Do you want some water?  
  - Who will believe that I'm at a convenience store drinking beer with Endest's Han Jung Woo? 

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,220
Byul? Byul?

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,060
- Oh yes.
- Byul, are you happy with your schedule?

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,280
Well, I think it's okay.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,590
Must be nice.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,080
Why? Endest has a lot of fans, right? There definitely are around me.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:42,900
Yes. I should be happy since I have a lot, but I think there are often people who go overboard.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,780
There's one toxic person, but that person must think I'm a doll.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,560
 - Why are you doing this to me?  
- What's wrong? I'm just a fan. 

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,200
I should overcome it all, what else can I do?

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,380
It's the job I have chosen. I should accept it, right?

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,410
Why?

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,880
I've never, even once, thought about why I had to.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,900
 The fact that you're speaking so matter-of-factly about your pain, 

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,870
 must mean that wound has been there for a very long time, and become very deep. 

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,050
 I know that feeling better than anyone. 

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,780
This is about my friend, but

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,050
do you want to listen to it?

22
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,390
My friend was a physical education college student.

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,020
But she got cut by some discarded glass, and injured her wrist ligaments.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,500
At that time, this friend said something exactly like what you just said.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,200
I got hurt, it's my fault, I have to accept it.

26
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,170
 That girl came to look for me at the office. 

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,970
 What kind of man would be scared? 

28
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,880
 Don't embarrass yourself and let people know you're having a hard time. Else your image would be ruined. 

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,860
But she suddenly thought this.

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,870
Is this really my fault?

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,040
The person who did wrong is the one who should have regrets.

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,390
After she thought about it like that, she felt a little better.

33
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,270
Even though I'm having such a hard time now,

34
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,470
my manager sent me off to do a show.

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,450
The person who bullies me with the excuse of being my fan... They are at fault.

36
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,490
You're getting the gist of it.

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,020
Go in.

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,070
Hey.

39
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,480
- Hearing a knock on my doors at night...  
- It scares you?

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,430
A little?

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,270
Then, if I ever need to give you something again,

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,190
how about I do this?

43
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,350
- What are you going to give me?  
- Is there  something you want to have?

44
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,330
No, but are you really going to do it?

45
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,770
If you hear it come out quickly. Clapping outside by myself will be a little embarrassing otherwise...

46
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,370
Understood. Go in and rest.

47
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,060
 There's no such thing as a perfect person in this world. 

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,950
 The Han Jung Woo that people can't even speak to! 

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,700
 - Isn't that person really famous?  
- Exactly. That really famous Han Jung Woo. 

50
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,860
 A person that looks perfect. 

51
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,900
Are you sleeping?

52
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,360
I just came in...

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,730
- That's right.  
- What is it?

54
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,190
Could you come into my room with me for a moment?

55
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,420
Your room?

56
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,900
Yes, um...

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,400
Excuse me...

58
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,190
- But, why am I...  
- Is there someone there?

59
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,100
What?

60
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,520
I don't think there's anyone here.

61
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,850
 

62
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,280
Here, it looks like someone came and left.

63
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,130
My manager.

64
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,530
Did you think there would be someone in here?

65
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,390
No.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,470
- You couldn't even go in enough to see the note?  
- It's not that I couldn't go...

67
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,380
Wait a moment.

68
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,240
What are you doing?

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,430
Actually, this is serious. This room is unfamiliar, right?

70
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,300
- That's why you can't take five steps from there up to here, right?  
- It's not that I can't walk them...

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,400
And that's why you asked me to come. I'll stay here, until you fall asleep.

72
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,930
- How do you know when I'll fall asleep? 
- You'll fall asleep before sunrise, I guess.

73
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,690
- I can't sleep until then...  
- Then I guess I'll have to stay longer.

74
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,670
- I feel a little...  
- Today, you helped me too.

75
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,050
 You said let's go out. Let's see each other alone. 

76
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,530
 Didn't you say that? 

77
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,300
Let me repay you, please.

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,400
- What are you doing?  
- Nothing. You're like a loyal dog.

79
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,430
A dog? You say thank you in a very unusual way, wow.

80
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,210
 

81
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,110
Why did you call me?

82
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,910
Here.

83
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,660
- It's a film camera, right?  
- Yes, let's try taking a picture.

84
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,230
- Why?  
- If you get pictures taken by a camera, you hyperventilate, right?

85
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,890
Isn't it because this camera scares you and you hate it?

86
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,640
Usually, the less you know about something the scarier those things become.

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,000
If you could learn a lot about this camera, wouldn't it get better?

88
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,110
Look...

89
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:09,810
This is the shutter. And this is called the focus ring.

90
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,010
Since you're going to be staying here for a week, wouldn't it be good if you at least get something out of it?

91
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,980
I've been a little scared of cameras recently, too. But these are a little different.

92
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,310
Since there is a limited amount of film, you have to be careful with every picture.

93
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,000
One picture at a time...

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,070
How is it? Do you want to try using it?

95
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,210
Byul!

96
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,310
You're here?

97
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,390
What are you doing? You're trying to look good in front of her because she is a celebrity, right?

98
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,150
I'm sorry to say that I don't treat people well just because they are famous, okay?

99
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,740
I don't do that either.

100
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,100
- Then what is that in your hands? Were you trying to get an autograph?  
- No!

101
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,960
I hope you are nice to Byul and able to get your autographs.

102
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,720
But don't bother my part time worker too much.

103
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,310
When did I? It wasn't that...

104
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh! We're in trouble. We're making Byul uncomfortable now.

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,290
Oh, my, what should we do now?

106
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:33,020
- Wow, I'm so uncomfortable... 
 - Byul, I really wasn't...

107
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,580
Hey, you're telling lies now too? Byul's really going to stop coming to our cafe.

108
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,600
Byul, I'm sorry. I just brought this in case...

109
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,710
Why did you do that?

110
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,840
She's always talking about idols and singing their praises,

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,360
so I did it to try to fix that. You said it too.

112
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,440
What kind of praises does she sing?

113
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,190
Well, she says that idols are different from normal people, that they're special. That sort of thing.

114
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,400
- But they're all people, like everyone else.  
- Boss, do you think that?

115
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,640
Me? I was acting like that, but...

116
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,630
- By chance, do you want special celebrity treatment?  
-No, no, no, not at all.

117
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,050
I like it here. Even though it hasn't even been two days.

118
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,270
You're going to like the five days left even more. Since she's here.

119
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,600
How did you bring these books?

120
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,590
I put them in my suitcase. I usually have no time to read, so it worked out well.

121
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,340
When you were packing those, didn't your company tell you to bring something else instead?

122
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,140
They did. Extremely.

123
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,620
- No.  Wait, wait!  
- Why are you stopping me?

124
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,990
Can't you give me at least this much space? I have things to pack too!

125
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,840
You should give me at least this much space!

126
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,690
No. How do you know if there's going to be a ball or a pool party?

127
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,580
- Give me!  
- I said no!

128
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:15,480
Not as much as you, but I also have problems sleeping in unfamiliar places. So I brought them to fall asleep while reading.

129
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,630
- Do you fall asleep reading that?  
- Yes.

130
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,320
- Should I read it too?  
- Sleep quickly. When you fall asleep I'll leave.

131
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,790
She said she'd leave if I fell asleep... but she fell asleep herself.

132
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,030
- I have something to tell you.  
- What is it? I'll listen.

133
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,710
Honestly, my name Jung Da Eun. I'm not Kim Byul.

134
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,130
Jung Da Eun? What member of what group is that?

135
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,060
- Oh, I'm just a normal-  
- A normal person, you said?

136
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,840
Please stop filming. Do you know this is fraud?

137
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
I was wrong. Would you just listen to me, please? For now, please calm down-

138
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
The penalty for Jung Da Eun here is to be ignored.

139
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,300
 What should I do? I'm sorry! 

140
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,110
Who is it?

141
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,390
