1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
 My name is Kim Byul. I debuted as an idol star 5 years ago. 

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,530
 My name is Jung Dae Eun. I'm a part-timer at a cafe. 

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,090
 You know the TV program that Byul agreed to do? Her co-star has been revealed. 

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,300
 It's Han Jung Woo. 

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,540
 I don't think I can do it... the reality show. 

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,300
 - You want me to go out on the show in Kim Byul's place? 
 - We beg you. 

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,100
 - What do I need to do? 
 - You need to become Kim Byul.  

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,360
 Are you done? Since I put in a special request for the makeup team, it should be simil... 

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,490
 Not just similar.  

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,970
 How can a body do that? 

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,560
 - Like this. 
 - Like this? 

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,300
 Eun Ha is the main vocalist. She's from an audition program, so she's quite famous.  

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,230
 This won't be enough for Byul. 
    

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,440
 - Hello Byul. 
 - Hello Jung Woo.  

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,220
 - You should address him sunbaenim (senior), not Jung Woo. 
 - Why? They're the same age! 

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,010
 - I will leave the program. 
 - No! 

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,040
 Han Jung Woo debuted many years before Byul. Why are you arguing? 

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,870
 Byul uses this every day, because she says it's a pretty color and long-lasting.  

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,030
 Beauty Fit Posh Debut. Please always wear it. 

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,540
- Miss Kim Byul? 
 - Oh, yes.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,690
I'll bring your luggage up for you, but I'll need your phone.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,890
Oh. Here you go.

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,280
You can go to the restaurant.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,180
 I am Kim Byul. 21 year old Kim Byul of the Angels.  

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,820
 Just for 7 days. 

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,130
Here. I wrote everything in here from how to wear an apron and make coffee to the names of the cafe owner and his sister.

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,440
Okay, thanks.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Shall we change the way you talk now? Like how Da Eun talks.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,970
- Thanks! 
 - Thanks...

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,980
Let's just try not to talk to others, okay?

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,540
Sorry. This must be why I'm called expressionless and rude.

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,210
Byul, you're the kindest idol I've ever met.

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,970
Later on, these misunderstandings will resolve themselves. So just don't get caught for this week.

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay. Don't worry.

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:21,120
 I'm Kim Byul. I am comfortable in front of the camera.  

36
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,350
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

37
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,260
 Wow, this is what he looks like? He's so much more handsome in person.  

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,590
 All of his features are so pronounced. And his face is small. And his skin is so white.  

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,490
Is there something on my face?

40
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,730
No, it's quite incredible.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
What?

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,410
I don't mean that your face is incredible, but... you as a whole.

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,500
Did you complete your tour well?

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,060
What? 
  Did I go on tour? To where? 

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,490
Yes! It was good, really good.

46
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,200
I heard it got cancelled because of the typhoon...

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,590
That's why it was good. I finally got some time to rest a bit.

48
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,690
You liked it because your tour got cancelled?

49
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,560
 I'm screwed.  

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,020
♫  I know I can't do anything about my feelings.  ♫

51
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,900
♫  No more hesitation. You can't stop this move  ♫

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,110
Da Eun, you're here? Come here.

53
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,620
I'm dancing to an Angels song on my school trip.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,810
Take a look. I'm dancing her part.

55
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,400
What do you think? Don't I resemble her a bit?

56
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,210
Yeah, you do.

57
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,810
Wait! Now that I think about it, you look really similar to one of their members.

58
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:19,810
You're so lucky you have an idol lookalike. Do I have one?

59
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,380
Da Eun, try this. I just made it, so it should be tasty.

60
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,630
Hey, hey. Cut it out now, it's too loud. Just sit down and eat this.

61
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,470
I can't! Everyone else is practicing too.

62
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,200
What's up with her? Da Eun really likes madeleines but she's not eating them.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,780
Maybe she just wants to eat them later. Hurry up and eat.

64
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,970
Maybe...

65
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,630
Excuse me.

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,110
 Mission - Order each other's meal. 

67
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,920
 This is the mission? I have to focus.  

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,960
 Let's order the most ordinary thing. Sure, steak sounds good. 

69
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,700
 I wonder what he's writing... 

70
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,990
 Is there anything else worth writing? 

71
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,950
What is this? Eggplant?

72
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,910
On my way here, I read in an interview that you like ratatouille. Luckily it was on the menu.

73
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,990
I do like ratatouille. I really do.

74
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,750
 - Of course it's pigeons! 
 - Nope, eggplant. 

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,170
 How can the thing you dislike the most in the world be eggplant? 

76
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,730
 Even during a war, I would eat a pigeon over an eggplant. I will never eat eggplant. 

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,090
What do you think?

78
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,010
It's delicious!

79
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,200
 Kim Byul, how can you like this? 

80
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,810
What are you eating?

81
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,960
A sandwich.

82
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,380
Wait! Isn't this eggplant?

83
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,390
Yeah. I put it in. Why?

84
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,730
What do you mean why? You said, even more that pigeons-

85
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,210
Da Eun! Sorry, but can you help me with this?

86
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,290
Sure.

87
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,720
She won't eat madeleines, but she'll eat eggplant? Da Eun?

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,040
 I ate all the eggplant I'll eat in my entire lifetime today. 

89
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
- It's difficult right, trying to act natural? 
 - Oh.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,980
I think I'm actually more comfortable on stage.

91
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,130
I'm quite a homebody myself, so it's not easy carrying conversation like this.

92
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,920
You're quite good at conversing.

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Usually, I rarely speak. To be honest, I rarely even leave the house.

94
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,070
 He's a pro, as expected. I need to be more like him. 

95
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,510
- Good work today. 
 - Thanks, you too.

96
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,290
- What are you going to do now? 
 - Aren't we going to our room?

97
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,960
- Oh... 
 - We should go up together and rest.

98
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,910
 What is this? Why is he getting off with me? 

99
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,710
 No way... are we in the same room? 

100
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,430
 By 'going up together and rest'... did he really mean together? 

101
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,400
- What's wrong? 
 - It's nothing.

102
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,270
 Is this the professional world? Since it's reality TV... everything is super 'real'? 

103
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,480
- I really don't think we should use the same room 
 - I'm-

104
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,990
- Even if it's a reality show... 
 - I'm next door.

105
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,260
Oh, you're next door?

106
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,580
- Rest up. 
 - Thanks.

107
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,840
- Hello? 
  - They didn't take your phone, right? 

108
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,490
- That was my condition for coming here. 
-  Make sure you don't get caught. Kim Byul got her phone taken away. 

109
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,230
 It's not too bad now that you're there, right? Don't let it show that you're having a hard time. That'd be embarrassing.  

110
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,020
If you're going to say things like that, just hang up.

111
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,940
 What a cold jerk. Alright. 

112
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,250
 I told you very clearly. I don't want to be on the program. 

113
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,560
 - It's because of that girl, right? 
 - You know I can't sleep well outside my house.  

114
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,940
 You call yourself a man... Hasn't she not been around recently? Do you think she'd follow you all the way to your hotel room? 

115
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,460
I'm just a regular college student, Jung Da Eun.

116
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm not some king with donkey ears... 
 (Korean folktale about keeping secrets)

117
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,420
Wait, what's this? This isn't mine.

118
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,880
 Room 1601 

119
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,510
Is he not inside?

120
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,180
Excuse me?

121
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,820
- I got the wrong bag. 
 - Right.

122
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,070
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

123
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,660
Why is he like that?

124
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,810
Is he sick?

125
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,750
 Hyung, where are you? When are you coming? 

126
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,680
 That girl... she came to the company office.  

127
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,570
Thank you.

128
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:06,250
Ari, you've been watching Da Eun since yesterday. Do you have something to say to her?

129
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,930
Don't you think it's weird?

130
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,330
It is weird. You've really been looking at her all day.

131
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,290
Forget it. There's no reason you would know.

132
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,830
 Da Eun, now that I think of it, you look really similar to this member.  

133
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,230
Is that person- No, that wouldn't make any sense.

134
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,140
 - Do you want some? 
- There's eggplant in here! 
- What about it? 

135
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,650
The eggplant sandwich makes even less sense!

136
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,070
Oh no, I think I'm right!

137
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,870
- Do your homework. 
 - Homework is not important right now.

138
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,100
Da Eun, I want this for my next birthday.

139
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,190
- Really?
 - Will you buy it for me?

140
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,030
- I'll buy it for you. 
 - Really? 
 - Sure.

141
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,790
You gave this to me two days ago as my birthday present.

142
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,060
Da Eun...

143
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,050
who are you?
 (formal speech)

144
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,600
 One Fine Week
