4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,750
Hi, guys!

5
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,833
Hello. I'm finally vlogging again.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,250
Hi, guys!

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,375
I'm not an actress. I'm a nobody.

8
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,875
But I will be famous.

9
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,416
Hey, Jojo.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,750
DECEMBER 7, 2019

11
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,208
- Hi, Jojo.
- Hi, Jojo.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,250
You're finally here, bro.

13
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,625
Burn! Burn!

14
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:26,958
Okay, hit it.

15
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,541
Careful, careful.

16
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,291
Babe?

17
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,500
- Let's go home!
- After this song.

18
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,500
- But I'm tired!
- Hang on.

19
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,708
Give me a minute.

20
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,208
It's already this late!

21
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,458
- Let's go!
- It's still early.

22
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,625
Give me that.

23
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,166
Drink this.

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,291
- No, I have a shoot tomorrow.
- Just a bit.

25
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,208
No!

26
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,875
Come on, let's go home! Now! Come on!

27
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,083
Here, take this.

28
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,208
Come on. Come on.

29
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,125
Hang on, hang on.

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,500
- Now what?
- I haven't paid.

31
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,958
You forgot your purse.

32
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,000
- Come on, come on.
- Waiter!

33
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,458
Pay for us, okay?
Your money is my money and my money is--

34
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,833
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,083
Idiot.

36
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go, babe!

37
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,583
Get up! Now!

38
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,708
- Are you good to drive?
- Of course.

39
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,458
In here.

40
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,583
Okay, careful.

41
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,875
Again.

42
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,916
Slowly.

43
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,333
Good.

44
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,125
- How's her blood pressure?
- Good.

45
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,375
Okay.

46
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,750
- Keep an eye on her.
- Yes, Doctor.

47
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, Doc!

48
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,875
Careful, careful.

49
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,541
- Be careful, sir.
- What's wrong?

50
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,125
How is she?

51
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,458
Just some minor injuries.
A few bruises here and there.

52
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,583
What do you mean?
She's going to be okay, right?

53
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,166
We need more time to observe her.
We fear that

54
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,750
the crash may have caused some
internal bleeding.

55
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,083
Now, please excuse me.

56
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,250
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

57
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,666
Babe…

58
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,333
Babe?

59
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,500
Babe?

60
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,166
Babe, you're fine, okay?

61
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,875
I'm fine too.

62
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,833
Just a little scratch.
See, you have some scratches too.

63
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,416
Come here!

64
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,458
Can't you stay out of trouble just
for one day?

65
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,916
Your father is outside taking care
of your mess.

66
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,500
It happened at 4:00 a.m., sir.

67
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,208
They're at Puri Sehat Hospital.

68
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,458
Yes, please help me
clean up my son's mess.

69
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,125
Have you called my mom?

70
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,250
I have.

71
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,333
Honey.

72
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Excuse me, ma'am, sir.

73
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,041
This is the admission form
for you to fill.

74
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:24,458
The specialist doctor will be available
to check her condition at 11:00 a.m.

75
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,333
- Doctor?
- Yes?

76
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:32,791
As you can see, we're okay,
just some minor scratches.

77
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,583
- Can we be discharged?
- No, it's better if the patient--

78
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:44,375
Doc, the patient has given me permission
to take her home to recover.

79
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,458
Thank you.

80
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,583
- Doc.
- Yes.

81
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,458
Careful, careful.

82
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,000
It hurts, Jojo!

83
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,541
- Just a short walk into the car.
- No! It hurts!

84
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,750
It hurts! It hurts!

85
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,625
- It hurts, Jojo!
- Careful, Nurse.

86
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,000
Nurse! Can you take the
patient back inside?

87
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,583
Sir, ma'am, we're not done examining
the patient.

88
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,458
She's at risk of internal injury and
we need to handle it.

89
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,166
- Is there a room available?
- We will make sure of that.

90
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,750
Okay, careful.

91
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,333
It hurts, Jojo!

92
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,416
- Did you finish your assignments?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,791
Really? I don't believe you.

94
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,833
I did.

95
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,166
They're gonna take your phone.

96
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,541
Fine, don't come crying to me if
anything happens.

97
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,083
Hello?

98
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,083
Miss Beatriz is concerned about
your grades.

99
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,958
"Three things I miss the most
about Indonesia."

100
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,875
HOME
RICE CRACKERS

101
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,958
Laura.

102
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,625
- Aren't you afraid of repeating a grade?
- Actually, five… "Five things."

103
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:18,375
"Janos, Petra, bike taxis…"

104
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,541
Hey, you're not stupid, y'know.

105
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,375
- You work hard.
- "Meatballs."

106
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,750
You wouldn't be accepted to
67 Senior High School if you didn't.

107
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:31,875
Exactly, Irene, I studied hard to get
accepted there, and then what?

108
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,250
Few months in, we were told to move here.

109
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,791
It's pointless.

110
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,333
Let's go.

111
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,375
- Bye. see you later.
- See you.

112
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,083
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

113
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

114
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,875
Dinosaurs!

115
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,208
- Laura! Irene!
- Laura, Irene, study hard, okay?

116
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,875
Irene.

117
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,583
Irene, come see this.
Mom sent a video of Janos.

118
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,041
It's so funny, I swear.

119
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,041
You should study, Laura.

120
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,083
Just come here and watch this,
it's so funny.

121
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,458
Watch this.

122
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,958
- Here, look.
- Can I watch it later? I'm studying.

123
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,666
Irene.

124
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,458
You're the only one I have here.

125
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,833
Laur--

126
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,333
- Hello?
- Hello, Mom.

127
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,333
Mom, I hate it here.

128
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,125
Mom, I want to go home.

129
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,000
Why? You have Irene there.

130
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,250
It doesn't make a difference
with or without her here.

131
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,333
Can I go home, please?

132
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,375
I'd be meaner to you if I stayed
here longer, Irene.

133
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,208
I miss Mom, I miss Petra and Janos.

134
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,708
You are a fighter, Irene.

135
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,666
You're strong.

136
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,708
Give them a hug from me.

137
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,125
Riko too?

138
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,958
What about him?

139
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,625
Because he cares so much about you.

140
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,916
I thought I'm his best friend,
but he keeps asking about you.

141
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,458
Go, or you're gonna miss your flight.

142
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,833
Good luck surviving on your own here.

143
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,208
Bye.

144
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,458
Janos, stop it!

145
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
Take this!

146
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,250
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll kick you!

147
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,625
- You want that?
- Mommy!

148
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,875
What's that?

149
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,250
Pee-pee salute!

150
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,708
- Janos, you can't say that!
- Well, I'm praying later!

151
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,791
One…

152
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,166
Janos, hurry up, take my picture!

153
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,208
One, two, three.

154
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,416
Dude, this is so embarrassing!

155
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,000
The things I do for you!
But a challenge is a challenge, right?

156
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,750
Hello, sir!

157
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,166
I'm applying a face mask.

158
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,250
Why are people paying so much attention
to my face?

159
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,500
- Don't forget to rate me five stars.
- Already done, Mr. Bagus.

160
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,000
See? I gave you five stars.

161
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

162
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,250
- Where is it?
- Show me.

163
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,666
No! My cheeks look so chubby. See?

164
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,125
Oh, please, Laura,
there's nothing wrong with your face.

165
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,250
Let me see.

166
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,416
Look at my cheeks.

167
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,250
What do you mean? You look great.

168
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,416
It's okay, chubby cheeks
can go away, right?

169
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,083
See, you're calling me chubby.
How dare you.

170
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,875
You're already pretty.

171
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,958
THE PLASTIC IS COVERING
HER PRETTY FACE LOL.

172
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,791
Hey, don't peek.

173
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,000
Will you stop? Go sit back down, man.

174
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,166
Crazy white girl.

175
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,458
You are being anti-social, though.
Talk to us.

176
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,541
Seems she's moved on.

177
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,125
There's always some fox sliding
into Laura's DMs.

178
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,000
Talk about being back on the market.

179
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,875
I say it's fine, as long as
you do the proper QC.

180
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,625
- Right.
- Come on, stop it.

181
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,125
- Who's the guy?
- Just someone.

182
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,000
- A bike taxi driver?
- Far. He lives far away.

183
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,208
- How far?
- London.

184
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,583
Hello.

185
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,958
Jojo, what are you doing here?

186
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,500
Why not? I told you I was coming home.

187
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,958
You didn't say you're coming home today.

188
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,000
I went straight from the
airport to give you this.

189
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,458
- From London?
- From Rawa Belong.

190
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,041
But I ordered it when I was still
in London.

191
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,625
And this.

192
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,208
Now this one is from London.

193
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,708
- More gifts?
- Open it.

194
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,166
Thank you.

195
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,083
- I know you've been wanting that.
- I bet you do.

196
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,750
Well? Do you like it?

197
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,208
Perfect.

198
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
My research was a success, then?

199
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,541
- Are you stalking me?
- Of course.

200
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,458
That's all I did in London,
stalking you 24/7.

201
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,875
You're sick.

202
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,250
I'm not sick. I'm more like…

203
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,458
fascinated.

204
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,458
Let's listen to some music.

205
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,875
Is this your song, Jojo?

206
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
This is your song, right?

207
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,208
Yeah. Why?

208
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,625
- No way, you're lying.
- What?

209
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,416
Why'd you think I'm lying?

210
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,208
I mean, this is my favorite song.

211
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,750
How would I know that?

212
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,750
You have been stalking me, haven't you?

213
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,208
Don't flatter yourself.

214
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,791
I'm not stalking you.

215
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,416
This is what I've
been listening to lately.

216
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,375
Really?

217
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
Yeah! See, here's a lyric that I like.

218
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,833
Hang on.

219
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,375
That line.

220
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,000
"Try to be comfortable,
as comfortable as possible."

221
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,500
That.

222
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,083
You're so rough.

223
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:07,208
If you want to get closer, just come here.
No need to be shy, come here.

224
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,458
Give me your hand.

225
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,083
Give you? You oughta pay.

226
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,708
Do you want to come in?

227
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,708
Next time.

228
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,083
Thanks.

229
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,791
Does this mean I make you happy?

230
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,208
Yeah.

231
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,125
I feel the same.

232
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,208
You don't just make me happy…

233
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,458
you make me very happy.

234
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,291
You're not allowed to take
too long replying to my texts.

235
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,333
And then?

236
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,958
And don't get too comfortable over there.

237
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,125
Last call for passengers…

238
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,375
They're calling me.

239
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,833
Can I have my suitcase?

240
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,041
Bye.

241
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,000
Safe flight!

242
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,750
- Love you.
- Love you.

243
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,458
Okay, guys. Don't forget to like,
comment, and subscribe.

244
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,750
I WANT TO GO BACK SOON.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

245
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,666
OH, REALLY?

246
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,708
- WHAT IF I GO THERE INSTEAD?
- CAN'T WAIT?

247
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,708
I MISS YOU ALREADY

248
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,750
Mom, phone call.

249
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,333
DECEMBER 8, 2019

250
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,791
Hello?

251
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,708
Jojo?

252
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,500
Laura…

253
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,208
Laura.

254
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,625
Where am I?

255
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,833
You're in the hospital.

256
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,458
Where's Jojo?

257
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,708
Jojo.

258
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,333
Babe.

259
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,958
Hi, Jojo.

260
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,708
Mom, I'm scared.

261
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,375
Don't be scared.

262
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,208
We're here with you always.

263
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,083
Hold my hand, Mom.

264
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,625
I am.

265
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,333
I am holding your hand.

266
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,333
I can't feel it.

267
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,500
- …and this medicine.
- Yes, Doctor.

268
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,208
- Doctor?
- Yes?

269
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,625
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you, ma'am?

270
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:38,083
I'd like to ask about a patient.
My daughter, Laura.

271
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,333
She's going to be okay, right?

272
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,416
We can't answer that now.

273
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
You should ask the specialist doctor.

274
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:50,750
She was wearing her seatbelt during
the crash. She should be okay, right?

275
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,083
You can ask that question to the
specialist doctor, son.

276
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,333
- Yes, Mom?
- Irene.

277
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,000
Laura got into an car accident.

278
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,583
What?

279
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,708
Mom?

280
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,458
Mom, I want to see Laura.

281
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,208
Switch to video call. Talk to her.

282
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:17,916
Oh, my God.

283
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:20,958
Laura.

284
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,083
How're you doing?

285
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,916
Just a few scratches and bumps.

286
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,375
Yes, but the doctor said

287
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,583
she needs to be x-rayed,
make sure there's no fluid in her lungs.

288
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,583
Oh, you know, it's just a formality.

289
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,583
Gosh, Laura.

290
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,750
- I'm fine, Irene.
- Are you sure?

291
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,916
Just focus on your exams. Okay?

292
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,708
I'll be fine.

293
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,250
So, there's an abnormality in
Laura's lungs, sir, ma'am.

294
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,125
And that's causing her to have
breathing difficulties.

295
00:23:56,208 --> 00:24:01,083
Due to her current condition,
we still have to observe her very closely.

296
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,458
There's nothing wrong with me, right?

297
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,083
You're fine, babe.

298
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,875
This…

299
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,125
Your numbness is just temporary.

300
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,875
You'll be all right soon.

301
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:22,291
But why is Mom so insistent
that I transfer to another hospital?

302
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,916
Laura needs an MRI test.

303
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,500
But unfortunately, we don't have
such facilities in this hospital yet.

304
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,958
She needs to be transferred to a
hospital that has an MRI machine.

305
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,458
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

306
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,083
I'm always here for you.

307
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,625
And I will take full responsibility.

308
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:50,458
I will cover all your hospital expenses.

309
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,875
Including this one.

310
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:56,791
Okay?

311
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,458
I love you.

312
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,208
Okay?

313
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,833
- Is that all, miss?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,500
Ma'am, it's your turn.

315
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,791
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

316
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,625
- Jojo.
- Yes, ma'am?

317
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,583
- Have you paid already?
- Yes, ma'am.

318
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,458
- All of it?
- Yes.

319
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,875
- Okay, okay.
- No problem.

320
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,375
Here's the thing, ma'am.

321
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,125
Laura has a spinal cord injury.

322
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,083
And her spine…

323
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:17,875
It was hit quite hard in the crash.

324
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:22,541
She should have received
emergency surgery on the same day.

325
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,708
It's already been four days.

326
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,708
I think it's a bit too late now.

327
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:31,583
So now, we need to perform
corrective surgery on Laura's spine

328
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,000
as soon as possible.

329
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,333
- Okay.
- That's it, ma'am.

330
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:39,958
Auntie.

331
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,333
Has Laura gone in the operating room?

332
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,208
She has.

333
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,708
She's been inside for three hours,
and they're still not done yet.

334
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,958
Auntie.

335
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,875
Does Irene know?

336
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,625
She does.

337
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,500
But I didn't tell her the whole story.

338
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,375
She has exams, I want her to stay focused.

339
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,333
So I didn't tell her everything
about Laura's condition.

340
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,750
Jojo is not here yet, Auntie?

341
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,958
Are you aware of this?

342
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,875
No.

343
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:32,958
Did you guys…

344
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,458
make this?

345
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:36,666
No, it wasn't us.

346
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,333
We suspect it was Jojo.

347
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,625
Well, I think…

348
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,583
It's okay to raise money for her,
but at least let the parents know first.

349
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,750
But we're not saying that
you have problems paying or anything.

350
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:52,958
It's not that.

351
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:56,208
We're more concerned about
what people will say on social media.

352
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,291
They can be so harsh.

353
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,833
Just look at her social media pages.
It can bait for the haters.

354
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,166
Actually…

355
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,375
We can still afford her hospital expenses.

356
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,750
But, Auntie, Jojo and his family
are taking responsibility too, right?

357
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,041
They said they would.

358
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,708
His mother told me they will cover

359
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:26,083
the hospital expenses 50-50, but…

360
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,416
I haven't heard from them again.

361
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:36,708
Actually, a few of us who are
close to Laura

362
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:40,875
have collected some money to help her out.

363
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,833
Here, Auntie.

364
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:51,375
I can't accept this. Like I said,
we can still cover the expenses. Really.

365
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,666
Auntie, this is just how we show her

366
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,708
that we care about her. Please take it.

367
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,750
Please, you shouldn't have to.

368
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,125
- We don't mind at all, Auntie.
- We don't mind at all.

369
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,375
We don't mind, really.

370
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,000
- Please take it.
- Please take it.

371
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,750
We all love Laura very much.
Please take it.

372
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,583
Auntie.

373
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:15,958
Thank you.

374
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,458
The bastard just showed up.

375
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,500
Come here.

376
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,541
- What the hell?
- Where the hell were you?

377
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,791
- Who wants to know?
- Why?

378
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:38,125
- Laura underwent surgery this morning.
- I know.

379
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,750
I've been texting her mother.

380
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,875
If you knew, why weren't you here?

381
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,125
What're you saying?

382
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,750
I was in the accident too.

383
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,958
You're nuts.

384
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,166
Jojo.

385
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,750
Laura wants to see you.

386
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,958
She's awake now.
She's in the recovery room.

387
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay.

388
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,708
Auntie, was the surgery successful?

389
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,416
They connected her to a machine…

390
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,458
to help her breathe.

391
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,958
- Where is the room, Auntie? That way?
- Yes. Let's go.

392
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,375
MARCH 2019

393
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,750
Hi!

394
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,000
Hey, meet my friend. This is Jojo.

395
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,000
- We've met.
- You have?

396
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,625
- How are you?
- He came all the way from London.

397
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:01,708
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Fine what?

398
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,500
- You know.
- You don't.

399
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,000
- You know him.
- I know, right?

400
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,291
Where's everybody else?

401
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,333
In the toilet.

402
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,625
Is that Jojo?

403
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,833
He's dating Laura now?

404
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,500
I don't know.

405
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,625
But you do know who his ex was, right?

406
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:25,375
- I know.
- You know how they ended, right?

407
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,000
I do. Jojo told me himself.

408
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,625
- And?
- And, it's a whole different case.

409
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,583
Totally different.

410
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,125
- But--
- Stop. Enough.

411
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,625
I really love him.

412
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,500
- You sure?
- And he loves me too.

413
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,250
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

414
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,875
Fine. As long as you're happy, okay?

415
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,208
Okay, let's go.

416
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,375
- Wanna go home?
- Miss, here's the bill.

417
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:03,000
- Hang on.
- No, let me, babe. It's okay.

418
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,000
Let me pay.

419
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:05,958
Here you go.

420
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,083
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

421
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,500
He leeches money from everyone he dates!

422
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:29,458
- I knew them all. They're all friends.
- Yeah, but he's not doing that to me.

423
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,625
His motive is obvious.
Who's paying every time you go out? You.

424
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,250
But I wanted to. He didn't ask!

425
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,750
Please listen to me, Laura.

426
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:37,916
- He's unfaithful.
- Are you my friend or not?

427
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,625
- I'm saying this as your friend!
- Fine!

428
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,958
Then be happy for me!

429
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,083
Can't you tell your friend is
genuinely happy?

430
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
- Leave me alone.
- Laura!

431
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,833
Mom.

432
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,750
Hello, Irene.

433
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,916
I think I'm going to break up with Jojo.

434
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,125
Why?

435
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,708
We just got home from Japan

436
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:22,208
after shooting videos for my vlog
and buying items to resell here.

437
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,000
Then, the new phone I bought over there
was confiscated by customs.

438
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:31,208
Then, instead of helping me,
he got mad and started blaming me.

439
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,958
Then he just left with his driver.

440
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,208
He left me alone at the airport.

441
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,500
Fuck, what an asshole.

442
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,375
I don't know.

443
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,333
I don't know what to do, I'm so tired.

444
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,708
I support your decision, leave him.

445
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:47,541
But who's gonna want to be with me?
I'm gonna be alone.

446
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,458
You're not alone. You have Mom.

447
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,208
You have Petra, Janos, and me.

448
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:56,458
Yeah, but that's not the same, Irene.

449
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,708
Think about how he's been treating you.
It's getting worse.

450
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,125
Fine. I'll call you again later.
I have to shoot my video.

451
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,708
Bye-bye.

452
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,083
- Hi.
- What do you want?

453
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,875
You made Laura cry.

454
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,708
Want some chocolate?

455
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:33,666
Here you go.

456
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,708
- Can I come in?
- Wait here.

457
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,208
Laura.

458
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,083
Janos, you never learn. Knock first!

459
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,541
Ha-ha, you missed.

460
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:51,875
What are you doing here?

461
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,250
I want to take you to see the sunset.

462
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,500
I don't need this, Jojo.

463
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:02,000
You haven't apologized to me,
do you realize that?

464
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,500
Well, I'm here.
And you threw away my gift!

465
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:05,916
What?

466
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,083
Not good enough.
You don't feel guilty?

467
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,708
You left me alone at the airport!

468
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:10,875
Well, I was angry too!

469
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,083
I told you not to buy that phone!

470
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,041
Now you know it was a bad idea.

471
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,666
I need it to make content there!

472
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,500
That's your problem.
All you think about is your content!

473
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,583
I do it for you too!

474
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,791
For me or for you? You wanted a
vacation too!

475
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:23,791
Shut up!

476
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,708
- Hey!
- Are they fighting?

477
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,208
Yes.

478
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,291
- Is Jojo being mean to Laura?
- Just eat the chocolate, kids.

479
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,875
Auntie, we're going out.

480
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,000
Bye, Mom.

481
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,750
What was that, Janos?
It's not funny.

482
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:55,166
- Don't do it again.
- Just go. I'll handle Janos.

483
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,625
DECEMBER 2019

484
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,375
It's so ugly!

485
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,625
Hey, don't post it. I warned you.

486
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,875
I look ugly without makeup.

487
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,083
- Fine, I'll do your makeup.
- No way.

488
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:18,125
I'm warning you, when I get better,
I'll kick your ass, Muay Thai-style.

489
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:23,750
- Try to walk first, then let's talk.
- At least I'm motivated.

490
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,541
It's like in the movies,
revenge is the best medicine.

491
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm so scared.

492
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:32,125
But don't take it out on us.
Make the person who did this to you pay.

493
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:35,000
- Listen to him.
- That's enough, guys.

494
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,416
Please don't blame Jojo.
He didn't do anything wrong.

495
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,958
It hurts him enough to see me this way.

496
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:47,875
God's teaching me to be humble,

497
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,833
even though all my friends are morons.

498
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,041
But these morons love you!

499
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:58,291
- Yeah, I know.
- We love you, Laura.

500
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:02,541
You know we love you, right?

501
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:12,500
I forgot. I have buy stuff for
Janos' assignment.

502
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,375
It's okay, Mom, you can go home.

503
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,500
No, I won't leave you.

504
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,750
I'll find a store that's still open. Easy.

505
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,958
It's okay, Mom.
Jojo is gonna be here soon anyway.

506
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,458
It's all right.

507
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,291
Sorry I'm late, Auntie.

508
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,333
I had to wait for the bike taxi to come.

509
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,458
It's okay.

510
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,458
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

511
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:53,416
I've got to find a bookstore
that's still open.

512
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,083
- Sorry, Mom.
- It's okay. Good night.

513
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,375
Jojo.

514
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,625
- Take care of her for me, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

515
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,666
- Call me if there's an emergency.
- Will do.

516
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,708
Jojo.

517
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,375
Yes.

518
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,708
Where have you been?

519
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,875
I was at home. Why?

520
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,083
You're very late.

521
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,416
I feel bad for my mom,
she was waiting for you.

522
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,541
- But I already apologized to her.
- Still!

523
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,500
You know it's late, right?

524
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,875
Sorry. Like I said,
it's the bike taxi's fault.

525
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,000
Excuses, excuses.

526
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,708
Why are you angry at me?

527
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,958
There's no point if
you don't want to be here.

528
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,625
Don't be dramatic.

529
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:45,291
- I'm by myself if my mom's not here!
- I'm here now. I'm here now!

530
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:49,458
I know you're tired, I know you're ill,
but I have to take care of myself too.

531
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,875
Doctor…

532
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,458
My daughter is going to walk again, right?

533
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:01,166
Ma'am, I think I have to tell you
the worst case scenario.

534
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:08,583
The chance of her to make a full recovery,
to the way she was before the car crash

535
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:12,250
is one in 1000.

536
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,666
I'm sorry, ma'am. That's the best
that we can do.

537
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,583
How come?

538
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,583
I don't understand…

539
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,291
Honey.

540
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,000
Doctor! Help him, Doctor!

541
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,666
Honey!

542
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,666
Nurse!

543
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,750
- Doctor!
- Let me help you, sir.

544
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,125
- Yes, Mom?
- Irene.

545
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:44,791
What is it, Mom?

546
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:50,416
They said Laura will never walk again.

547
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:55,625
And your father's condition got worse
when he heard the news.

548
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,083
I can't take this…

549
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:05,375
Sorry if I'm disturbing you.

550
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,791
It's okay, Mom.

551
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,875
I understand your final exam is coming,

552
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,708
but this is too hard to take.

553
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,791
Poor Laura.

554
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,833
Do you need anything else?

555
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:43,875
Hi, Irene.

556
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,833
Hi, Laura.

557
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,958
Keep your sister company.

558
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,875
Don't be a crybaby.

559
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,375
I'm not crying.

560
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,291
I can see you're crying.

561
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,458
No, I just miss you so much.

562
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,208
You don't need to cry.

563
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,708
But I missed you so much.

564
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,125
Petra! Janos!

565
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,000
Irene's here! Say hello to her.

566
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,833
- Irene's home!
- Yay!

567
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,291
- Irene!
- Irene!

568
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,291
Hey! Hey, you.

569
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,708
- Come here.
- Irene!

570
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,791
Is Irene home?

571
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,625
Hey, Janos, Petra.

572
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,125
What's so funny? What are you watching?

573
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,000
I feel left out. I'm upset.

574
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,583
Fine, okay.

575
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,000
Dad, have you eaten?

576
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,000
Did you finish your meal?

577
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,375
I want Padang rice.

578
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:19,125
By the way, it's late, where is he?

579
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:23,500
Relax, Irene, he lives far from here.

580
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,583
I don't care. He's late.

581
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,750
Babe?

582
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,833
Hi, Auntie.

583
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,166
Speak of the devil.

584
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,666
- Babe.
- Hi, Babe.

585
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,500
Do you like my new do?

586
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:38,750
- New hairdo?
- Yup, like it?

587
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,750
Looks good.

588
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,458
- Later, guys.
- Hi, Irene.

589
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:43,541
Hi.

590
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,583
Irene, close the door, please.

591
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,666
Thanks.

592
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,083
- Jeez. Chill, man.
- Let's take a pic.

593
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,208
What's wrong, Mom?

594
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,708
Nothing.

595
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,208
It's just…

596
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,083
I'm looking at our monthly expenses.

597
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,375
Can I see?

598
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:19,875
See that?

599
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,875
That's Laura's hospital bill.

600
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,750
I thought Jojo took care of it?

601
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,125
I thought so too.

602
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:29,125
When he paid, I thought he used his
card, but he used Laura's instead.

603
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,041
What?

604
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:32,416
That fucker, how dare he!

605
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,375
- Calm down.
- Mom, but this is--

606
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,750
Calm down.

607
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,458
Let's just focus on Laura's condition.

608
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:43,583
Auntie, I think Laura pooped.

609
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,500
Let's go.

610
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:50,583
Okay.

611
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,208
Jojo?

612
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:08,958
Jojo?

613
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,708
Jojo?

614
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,125
Run, bitch!

615
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,041
Hey!

616
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,916
Are you deaf? I've been calling you.

617
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What do you want?

618
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,416
Here, throw this out.

619
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,541
What's that?

620
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,666
Throw it out!

621
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:28,625
All you do is play games.

622
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,708
- Throw it out where?
- Outside.

623
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,458
Babe.

624
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:50,125
Babe, can I upgrade my character?

625
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,458
Sure, just buy it.

626
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,750
Babe, can you get me water?

627
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:59,458
Hang on, Babe. I'm pushing my rank.

628
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:03,375
Babe, water.

629
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,750
Babe!

630
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:11,958
Okay, okay.

631
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,958
- Babe.
- Okay, okay.

632
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,583
Done?

633
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,500
Thanks, Babe.

634
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:41,875
Babe?

635
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,458
Please don't leave me.

636
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:57,291
Now let's focus on exercising
the upper part of your body.

637
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:01,750
When you can sit up on your own,
then we move on to your lower body.

638
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:06,291
- For how long, Doctor?
- Well, you have to do this regularly.

639
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,375
Sorry to bother you, doctor.
There's an urgent need.

640
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,708
Forever, Doctor?

641
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,000
Laura, please excuse me.

642
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,833
Mom…

643
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,208
Is it gonna be forever, Mom?

644
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,208
Mom?

645
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,041
I'll never walk again, Mom?

646
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,291
No. Mom.

647
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,541
We're doing the therapy.

648
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,458
I know, but am I gonna be crippled
forever, Mom?

649
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:39,958
We're doing the therapy.

650
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,125
No, no. What does this mean?

651
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,208
Doctor?

652
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:48,583
So, I'll never walk again, Mom?

653
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:53,125
- Let's try the therapy.
- No, no, no!

654
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:55,833
This is not happening. I want to walk!

655
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,250
No! I refuse to accept this!

656
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:07,541
No.

657
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,125
Mom.

658
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,208
Doctor.

659
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,791
I'm tired.

660
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,208
- Hey.
- I'm tired, Irene.

661
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,375
I know, but you have to be patient.

662
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,458
Okay?

663
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,208
What's the point of living,
if I live like this?

664
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,458
I can't live like this forever.

665
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,208
I could've gone home alone, Irene.
I could've gotten a taxi.

666
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:47,833
I didn't need to go home with him.

667
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:58,083
Hey.

668
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,291
I regret my decision, Irene.

669
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,875
That's my biggest regret.

670
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:27,708
What's wrong, Irene?

671
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,625
Who were you angry with?

672
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,333
No, no. Come here, come here.

673
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,750
You must be angry with Janos, right?

674
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:42,750
No, don't be ridiculous.
Come here, come here. It's not true.

675
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,291
No.

676
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,083
You're okay.

677
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:01,875
Jojo's not coming?

678
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,208
No. In fact, I'm relieved he's not coming.

679
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:09,833
Guess what this is?

680
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:11,875
What?

681
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,625
It's martabak.

682
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,791
- Laura can't eat martabak.
- This is for you.

683
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:20,291
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

684
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:22,708
Let's eat at the table. Come on.

685
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,125
So, is it good?

686
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:35,375
By the way, Irene, I want to come here
more often to help you look after Laura.

687
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,625
Are you sure?

688
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,125
- It's hard work, you know.
- Exactly.

689
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:44,833
I think you could use
an extra hand to help with Laura.

690
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,083
But I also need you to support me.

691
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:49,291
We can't pamper her like Mom's been doing.

692
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,208
I want Laura to be independent.

693
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,958
- You might think I'm cruel, but--
- I'll support you.

694
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,291
Here, wipe your mouth. Messy eater.

695
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,708
The martabak is all over your face.

696
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,250
Pouty again, huh?

697
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,125
Shut up.

698
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,125
What did you write?

699
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,958
That's me gossiping in code, stupid.

700
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:53,125
Now that's better. Doing facials yourself.

701
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:56,958
I'm doing the facials but you're the one
who gets prettier. That's my loss.

702
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,750
Wow. Go on, throw it again.

703
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,875
I think insulting her motivates her.

704
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:07,083
- You're so spoiled.
- Yeah, you're so spoiled.

705
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,208
You guys are so fun together.

706
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,000
Why don't you just date? That saves
me money, y'know.

707
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,458
I pay for one nurse and get
another as a bonus.

708
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,458
Irene?

709
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:11,291
Irene?

710
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,958
I can't. I can't.

711
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,833
I can't take it.

712
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,041
You have to be strong.

713
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:25,375
She must be in a lot of pain.

714
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,750
All this time, Laura…

715
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,416
She has been in pain but she
never says anything.

716
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,291
Irene.

717
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:38,083
She's only comfortable when you do it.

718
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,708
Be strong.

719
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,041
Gently, Irene.

720
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,416
Okay, bear with me.

721
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,291
- That hurts!
- Hang on, hang on.

722
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:57,458
- I told you, gently!
- I can't!

723
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,666
Irene.

724
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:03,666
Sorry, sorry. Okay, I can hold the pain.

725
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:05,916
I'm gonna hold the pain.

726
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,458
Okay, please?

727
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,708
Please stay.

728
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,458
All right.

729
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,458
Okay, okay.

730
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:28,083
You don't have to do this forever, Irene.

731
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,458
What do you mean?

732
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,291
You don't have to take care of me forever.

733
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:39,833
You're pretty, smart…

734
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,208
You work hard too.

735
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:47,083
You shouldn't be my nurse forever.

736
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,666
That's a sad future.

737
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:51,750
But I like taking care of you.

738
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,583
Nobody likes taking care of sick people.

739
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,375
Irene?

740
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:10,166
I told Riko to take you out today.

741
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,875
What? No!

742
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,375
I like being here.

743
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:19,125
Jakarta isn't just my bedroom, Irene.

744
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,125
Since you returned, you haven't been out.

745
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:25,208
I want to stay at home.
I like being at home.

746
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,625
- Come in.
- Yes, come in.

747
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:32,000
Sorry, am I interrupting?

748
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:34,083
Not at all. Come in.

749
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,250
- Are we still going out?
- Of course.

750
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,250
- What?
- Go change your clothes. Hurry.

751
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:43,000
How dare you guys plan
something behind my back.

752
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,625
Just go and have fun. Okay?

753
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm not in the mood.

754
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,625
- Have you ordered a bike taxi for Jojo?
- Hang on.

755
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:52,291
You're doing what for Jojo?

756
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,875
He wants to come over, but he ran
out of money. So I'm ordering for him.

757
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,625
Are you out of your mind?

758
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,500
No. It's not gonna happen. Cancel it.

759
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,333
Too late. I've booked the ride.

760
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,083
Riko.

761
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:08,583
Let's go.

762
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,708
Hang on.

763
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,083
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

764
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:17,958
Hi, Irene.

765
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,083
Irene, let's go.

766
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,208
Jojo?

767
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,458
Jojo.

768
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,208
Jojo, I'm thirsty.

769
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,083
Jojo?

770
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:47,541
Damn, that looks bad. The front,
the left, the back, totally wrecked.

771
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:50,750
- Yeah, that's ruined.
- I don't want to see. Here, take it.

772
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,666
My God, it's destroyed.

773
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,375
A lot of things don't add up.

774
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,125
The crash happened
at around 4:00 or 5:00 a.m.

775
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,791
But he only called
Laura's mother at 2:00 p.m.

776
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,625
And then, Jojo said
he lost his phone and wallet.

777
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:11,000
Bullshit. He was using Laura's
ATM card at the first hospital.

778
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:13,208
Fuck, so he hasn't spent a cent on her?

779
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,083
He paid the 8 million using her card!

780
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,166
Son of a bitch.

781
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:23,458
I was sleeping, I didn't hear you call me.

782
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,916
If you don't want to take care of me,
just say so!

783
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
- I don't like your tone.
- Stop pretending!

784
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,458
- Pretending what?
- Don't lie!

785
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:31,000
- What am I lying about?
- Liar!

786
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:34,916
- What lie? What did you hear?
- A lot of people have told me.

787
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,708
- Who?
- Stop making excuses!

788
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,416
Who told you things? Your friends?

789
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,291
I know I'm a burden to you. I know.

790
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,125
What are you talking about?

791
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:43,291
I'm a burden!

792
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,958
But this was your fault!

793
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,625
No! You're just being paranoid!

794
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,666
Who have you been listening to?

795
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,750
Your friends? You know they're toxic.

796
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:53,708
- It's you who's toxic, asshole!
- Why am I the toxic one?

797
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:59,375
They love me more than you do, Jojo.

798
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,541
You're a fucking asshole.

799
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,333
They love you?

800
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,750
Your friends are full of shit, you know!

801
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,791
Now if all you want to do is
yell at me, I'd rather leave.

802
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,375
Get out!

803
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:11,458
Okay, I'll leave!

804
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:14,500
Get out! I don't want you here anymore.
You're full of shit!

805
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,666
Hey, don't forget, the accident
happened to both of us!

806
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,791
I was also hurt.

807
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:22,875
Bitch.

808
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,375
Irene, has Jojo left?

809
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:39,625
It's okay, Laura. Let him go.
He's an asshole.

810
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:40,750
I can't, I can't.

811
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:44,000
Laura, you have to know these things
that we didn't know before.

812
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,958
Enough, Irene. Enough, enough.

813
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,291
Riko, tell him to come back.

814
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,625
- Call Jojo. Tell him to come back.
- Laura.

815
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:52,666
Please, I really hope you can forget him.

816
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,750
I can't, Irene. I need him. Shut up.

817
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:57,958
Riko, please.

818
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,875
But you're always bickering with him.
I don't get it.

819
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,375
We always fight, Irene.
I was just mad at him.

820
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,000
I didn't mean what I said.

821
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,458
Please? Riko.

822
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,458
Now, Riko!

823
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,625
If not him, then who?

824
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:32,666
Who wants to be with a cripple like me?

825
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,291
You don't understand. Don't touch me.

826
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,708
You don't understand.

827
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,083
I've got something to show you, girls.

828
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,000
What is it, Mom?

829
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,291
What is it?

830
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:17,125
These are the earnings
from the sale of your products.

831
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:21,958
No way!

832
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,166
Look, Laura.

833
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:30,500
Seriously?

834
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,083
You're making money even when you're sick.

835
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,500
This is crazy.

836
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,833
So now we don't have to worry about

837
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:43,625
hospital expenses, surgery,
doctor fees, and everything else.

838
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:47,583
- No more of those.
- No, don't use all the money on me.

839
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,500
Why not?

840
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:53,458
Let's use the money to buy a new house.

841
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,500
No.

842
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,208
- I disagree.
- So that we don't have

843
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,791
to rent anymore. Right, Irene?

844
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,041
Please, Mom?

845
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:05,583
Mom, this is my dream.
I want to buy a bigger house for you.

846
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,833
Okay? For Janos, Petra, and everybody.

847
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,208
Please, Mom. This is my dream.

848
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:20,791
- Will it make you happy?
- Of course.

849
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,500
I'll be very happy.

850
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,083
Thank you.

851
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,791
Can I join in?

852
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:37,291
I don't want to be left out.

853
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,583
Thank you.

854
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:42,083
- I want to join you girls too.
- Get in!

855
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,875
We're getting a new house!

856
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,875
We're almost there, don't peek.

857
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,875
- Are we there yet, Mom?
- Almost.

858
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:55,583
- Now?
- Little more…

859
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:56,791
Hang on.

860
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,583
Tada!

861
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,458
It's so big!

862
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:07,166
Hooray!

863
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,458
Now, now, now.

864
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:10,500
Yay!

865
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,666
Do you like it, Laura?

866
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:13,833
Of course I do.

867
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:14,916
Thank you.

868
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:20,250
Come here, Petra.

869
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,708
- You have to sing too, Mom, come on!
- Riko's here, Irene.

870
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,041
Hey, come in.

871
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,833
What is it?

872
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,291
Hey, what's up?

873
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:46,875
Irene, I…

874
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,583
I don't know how to tell you this.

875
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,041
Why don't you come in?

876
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,500
I'd better go.

877
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,375
Don't go. My Mom's here.
Don't do that in front of her.

878
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,625
- What is it?
- Irene?

879
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,375
- Riko, come on in.
- Irene.

880
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,875
C'mon, stay for a while. Come in.

881
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:04,958
- Why are you outside? Let's talk inside.
- I know, right? He's acting weird.

882
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:08,375
Now, you sit down over there.
I'm gonna go clean up some things, yeah?

883
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:14,958
What's wrong with you?

884
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,375
Do you remember…

885
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:25,708
Tony?

886
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,750
- Tony, Ami's ex?
- Yeah.

887
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:34,375
He lives in Bangkok now.
He's working there.

888
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,750
And then?

889
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,833
What's wrong?

890
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:41,875
Shit.

891
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,083
Riko?

892
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:46,208
Tell me.

893
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:49,208
He sent me this.

894
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,750
- What is it?
- Fucker!

895
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,000
Fucking son of a bitch!

896
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,375
- What is it, Irene?
- You don't need to know.

897
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,291
- What's going on?
- Nothing. You don't--

898
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,791
Listen, you don't need to watch it.

899
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,416
But if you must know,

900
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,666
your boyfriend was caught cheating on you.

901
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:12,708
Okay?

902
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,791
That little shit.
How many times have I told you?

903
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,750
- I want to see it.
- No.

904
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,666
- I want to see.
- For what? No.

905
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,875
- I want to see!
- It's just going to hurt you.

906
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,041
Shut up, Irene!

907
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:29,833
- Fine, show her. Let her see the video.
- I want to see!

908
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,375
You have to forget him.

909
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:50,625
He's an asshole, you know?

910
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:52,458
Irene, I'd like to be alone for now.

911
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,250
- Laura, don't be like that.
- You two, go inside!

912
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,375
- Laura, please, we were--
- Go inside!

913
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:08,500
Let us know if you need anything.

914
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:00,458
Riko!

915
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,083
Mom! Mom!

916
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,291
Laura?

917
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:32,958
C'mon, let's eat.

918
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:37,458
- Just a little.
- I'm not hungry, Mom.

919
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:44,291
All right. I'll leave your food here.

920
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,625
Hi, Auntie.

921
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,875
Hi, Babe.

922
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,625
How are you today?

923
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:13,375
I couldn't stop thinking about
you last night.

924
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,291
Stop it, Jojo.

925
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,708
- What do you mean?
- Stop hurting me, Jojo.

926
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:21,750
- I don't want to be a fool, Jojo.
- What are you talking about?

927
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,583
I'm not stupid, Jojo!

928
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:28,125
- I'm breaking up with you. I can't.
- What is with you?

929
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:29,875
I don't want to see you again!

930
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,583
- What's with you, Laura?
- Bangkok!

931
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,125
Bangkok, Jojo.

932
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,041
- I know everything.
- I can explain--

933
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,500
You can't fool me this time.

934
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,541
- Let me explain.
- I don't want to hear it!

935
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:48,583
- Please, listen.
- I don't want to hear it!

936
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,125
- I can explain!
- I don't want to hear it, Jojo!

937
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:53,458
Stop! Stop! Get out of my house, Jojo!

938
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,250
- Leave me alone, Jojo.
- Okay, okay.

939
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,750
Okay, I'll go, I'll go.

940
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,333
- Get out of here.
- Okay, okay.

941
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,416
- But don't ever ask me to come back.
- Never.

942
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,791
Okay.

943
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,291
- Never, Jojo!
- You better not want me back again.

944
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:31,875
Did you sleep at all?

945
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:35,750
Have you seen…

946
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,583
- my IG update?
- Not yet.

947
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,208
Here, look at this.

948
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,833
I've changed all of the captions
of my photos with Jojo.

949
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:50,958
And it went viral.

950
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,083
Laura.

951
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:56,375
You don't need to be afraid anymore.

952
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:58,916
You will never be alone.

953
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,750
I'm not afraid of being alone
anymore, Irene.

954
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,833
I'm just afraid of being
a burden to everyone.

955
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:08,500
You're not always a burden.

956
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,458
Well, you kinda are right now, but…

957
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,041
I like it, you know?

958
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,541
By the way, I don't think you need
this photo anymore.

959
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:34,458
Run, Janos, or do you want the roach?

960
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:41,875
Okay, guys, now I will
put on this body serum.

961
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:47,625
It smells so good.
I swear, the smell will last 24 hours.

962
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:51,083
Your mother's beautiful,
does she have a crippled daughter?

963
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,625
No! Weak!

964
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,750
Hello, Dad. How are you?

965
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:08,875
The doctor said they need to do a
tracheostomy on me.

966
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:12,375
Don't worry about me, okay?

967
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:16,250
You have to stay strong.

968
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:20,333
Because I know you are a strong girl.

969
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:29,916
Sasha has told me what happened to Laura.

970
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,750
She has to get justice.

971
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:35,583
With Uncle's, Auntie's
and Irene's permission…

972
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:38,708
I'm here to help.

973
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:43,416
We have to sue Jojo
for evading responsibility.

974
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,291
Yes, you've got my permission.

975
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,208
I give my permission too.

976
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,541
Laura, if you're okay with that,
I will too.

977
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:06,291
If everyone agrees,
I will process it immediately.

978
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,375
And you don't have to worry about
the cost or anything.

979
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:11,166
I'm only here to help Laura.

980
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:16,708
- But I feel bad for Jojo.
- He doesn't even care about you, Laura.

981
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:21,500
This might not just affect you, Laura.
You're a public figure now.

982
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,250
And people are watching you.

983
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:26,416
If you are brave enough to seek
justice against a man

984
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,375
who not only broke your heart but also
broke you physically

985
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:32,583
- and refused to take responsibility--
- Not even an apology.

986
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:36,125
You're going to set an example for all
women out there to stand up

987
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:38,916
for themselves against the abuse of men.

988
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,250
Accepting my fate is not enough, huh?

989
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:45,500
Laura.

990
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,250
Let's fight together.

991
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,083
To seek justice for you.

992
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,375
This morning we are at
the court hearing for Laura's case.

993
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:03,833
It looks like she's arrived
at the Jakarta District Court House.

994
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,000
Okay, let's start.

995
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:37,833
The evidence shows that Jojo has
demonstrated good intention

996
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:41,333
to take care of you after the accident.

997
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,541
He took you to the hospital.

998
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:47,291
He paid all the hospital expenses.

999
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:50,916
He also raised funds for you
through Kitabantu.com.

1000
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,250
Those were not done
with good intentions, sir.

1001
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,291
- Your Honor, I--
- Calm down, miss.

1002
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,791
Wat this gentleman said is
not true, Your Honor.

1003
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:02,875
Yes, please calm down.
I will give you time to testify later.

1004
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,583
Order in the court!

1005
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,041
Miss Laura, is it true that Jojo

1006
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,500
was driving under the influence
that morning?

1007
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,875
I don't remember clearly, Your Honor.

1008
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:20,875
I was so sleepy that I passed out
once I got inside the car.

1009
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:25,208
Why didn't you tell the
defendant not to drive?

1010
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:26,833
Because I was…

1011
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,291
I was already very sleepy, Your Honor.

1012
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:34,416
So you deliberately
let the defendant drive?

1013
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:38,833
Well, he was my boyfriend
at that time, sir.

1014
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,333
I trusted him.

1015
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:43,791
Order in the court!

1016
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:46,125
It was very late in the night, sir.

1017
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:49,625
If I didn't go home with him,
who else could I have gone home with?

1018
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:52,375
We've done this before and
nothing happened.

1019
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,291
Order!

1020
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:59,833
All right, the court is adjourned.
We will resume tomorrow.

1021
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,333
COURT ADJOURNED
LAURA STRUGGLES TO TESTIFY FREELY

1022
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:17,291
Mr. Jojo was with Miss Laura
when the accident happened.

1023
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:22,666
However, Mr. Jojo's negligence,
which indirectly resulted in the car crash

1024
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:26,708
in our opinion cannot be
categorized as a criminal act.

1025
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:28,875
With all due respect, Your Honor,

1026
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:33,708
we think that Miss Laura is being dramatic
and is exaggerating the incident.

1027
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,958
This is a big deal, sir.

1028
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:40,458
He made me a cripple.

1029
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,625
He has been manipulating me.

1030
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:47,666
From the beginning of the accident,
he has never treated me fairly, sir.

1031
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:49,916
He kept lying to me.

1032
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,375
The car accident happened at dawn.

1033
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:55,083
Yet he only contacted my family
at 2:00 p.m.

1034
01:17:56,083 --> 01:18:00,750
When I was in a lot of pain,
he forced me to leave the hospital

1035
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,500
without any medical treatment at all.

1036
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:08,708
And he used my credit card
to pay all the hospital bills.

1037
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:14,000
He pretended to pay from
his own pocket, fooling my parents.

1038
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:17,000
He has also financially
benefitted from the accident.

1039
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:20,833
He raised money for me
without my permission.

1040
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:23,541
I've never asked him to do that, sir.

1041
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,833
I am the victim here.

1042
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,083
But why do I feel…

1043
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,000
like I'm the one who's being
backed into a corner?

1044
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:43,458
When we were talking before,
when you first arrived at the studio,

1045
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:45,416
you looked happy.

1046
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,458
Is this fake?

1047
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:48,375
No.

1048
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:51,833
But, I do feel happier.

1049
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:55,375
Aside from her current condition,
what else is she experiencing?

1050
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,875
Because she's bedridden,
she gets dizzy sitting up.

1051
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:00,500
She also has decubitus.

1052
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:03,333
- What is decubitus?
- It's like a bedsore.

1053
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,416
- Where are you feeling it?
- On my back.

1054
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,291
I have some pictures.
You want to see?

1055
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:12,791
But you look so happy and cheerful,
like you have no problems at all.

1056
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,666
Of course I have problems.

1057
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,916
But I can't just cry
about it all the time.

1058
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:23,375
I might cry again tonight though,
when nobody's looking.

1059
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:28,083
All I can do is confide
in my sister, or my mom.

1060
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:31,291
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes, but it's getting better.

1061
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:32,625
I really admire you.

1062
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:36,375
You look so strong and you can still
manage to smile a lot.

1063
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:39,208
I'm not made of steel or anything, no.

1064
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,875
Even the strongest people,
who do they confide in?

1065
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:46,291
Other than to their God, Mom, or Dad?

1066
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:49,458
I mean, this person,
this girl in front of me,

1067
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:54,916
is a Laura that's basically
trying very hard to be strong.

1068
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:57,708
Yes.

1069
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,583
I'm doing my best.

1070
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:07,833
Because I don't want to
make my friends sad.

1071
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,416
So what, am I supposed to look
sad all the time?

1072
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:17,916
They'd probably wouldn't
want to visit me anymore.

1073
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,541
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this is the situation

1074
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,708
outside the court house.

1075
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,125
Why did you come here?

1076
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:05,583
Because I'm a woman. I empathize
with Laura and I want justice for her.

1077
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:12,291
I just want Jojo to be held accountable
for all he's done to Laura, that's all.

1078
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,791
And I heard that Jojo's family
denied everything.

1079
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,125
Then, what about Laura's family?
That's all.

1080
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:22,166
Justice for Laura!

1081
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:30,958
I will let Miss Laura have the floor
for her closing statement.

1082
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,833
I've been paralyzed for
more than two years now.

1083
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:41,375
I can't walk, all I can do
is lay on my bed.

1084
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:44,291
I can't do anything.

1085
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:48,416
But I'm not angry anymore, Your Honor.

1086
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:51,416
I have accepted my fate.

1087
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:54,166
I accept that I have to
live like this forever.

1088
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:58,625
I never wanted to be in this court.
I'd rather be at home.

1089
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:01,458
With my family.

1090
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,791
And my friends.

1091
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:11,583
At first, I didn't want to press charges
against anybody for what happened to me.

1092
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,083
But, sitting behind me are the people

1093
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:17,666
whose lives I have
made harder, Your Honor.

1094
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:21,791
They have to take care of me.

1095
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,958
They try their best to look fine,
but I know…

1096
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:32,250
I have made their lives miserable.

1097
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:38,208
Also, it's not that I don't
want to see Jojo enjoy his life.

1098
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,791
I just want him to
learn his lesson, Your Honor,

1099
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,416
from what this accident has done to me.

1100
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:50,541
I'm here only to get justice.

1101
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:54,000
Not just for me.

1102
01:22:56,708 --> 01:23:02,458
But for my family,
who have tirelessly taken care of me.

1103
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,250
From morning to morning.

1104
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:09,333
For my friends who have
never failed to make me laugh.

1105
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:13,833
And for all the women who
share the same fate as me.

1106
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:18,583
I want them to stand up.

1107
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,958
And dare to seek justice.

1108
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,958
It's not about the pain, Your Honor.

1109
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:29,208
It's not just the physical pain
that's damaged my body.

1110
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:32,083
Not just that.

1111
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,375
But also the disappointment…

1112
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:43,708
for all the injustices I've experienced.

1113
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:46,458
And my family as well.

1114
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:56,083
That is all, Your Honor.

1115
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:59,375
Thank you.

1116
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:03,458
Justice for Laura!

1117
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:05,208
Justice for Laura!

1118
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,041
Order! Order!

1119
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:35,166
I'm so proud of you, Laura.

1120
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:37,583
Thanks, Irene.

1121
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,541
You've always been
by my side the entire time.

1122
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,583
No problem.

1123
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:51,958
I know, sorry.

1124
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:56,708
I've been saving up some money, Irene.

1125
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,000
I want to go to Switzerland.

1126
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:05,541
Now this is a fun talk. Travelling.

1127
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,458
Euthanasia is legal over there, Irene.

1128
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,125
You want to be put to sleep?

1129
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,125
It's one of their methods, yeah.

1130
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,875
But I want you to come with me.

1131
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:25,125
I want you to do my makeup
so that I look good when I go.

1132
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:27,583
Like Snow White. Right?

1133
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,083
Think you're strong enough
to get on a plane?

1134
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:39,958
- It's a long flight, you know.
- Good point.

1135
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,458
If I get bored, I can't just get off.

1136
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,000
Irene?

1137
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:18,833
Look at those white lights.

1138
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:25,041
- Don't freak me out, I'll leave.
- No, I'm not talking about ghosts.

1139
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:28,583
It doesn't have a shape or form.
It's just this glow.

1140
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:29,916
Can you see it?

1141
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,291
You want me to shoo it away?
I'm gonna do it.

1142
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:35,208
There. Gone.

1143
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,625
I think I'm fine with it.
Keeps me company.

1144
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:42,916
If you're annoying,
I'd tell them to stay with you.

1145
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,416
Oh, yeah? You're annoying!

1146
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:50,375
All right.

1147
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:52,833
Go to sleep, stop watching TV.

1148
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:53,750
Night.

1149
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,708
- Bye.
- Bye.

1150
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,291
Yeah, I'm about to leave. Okay.

1151
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:04,375
- Riko.
- Hey, you ready?

1152
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,500
Laura's GERD is acting up again.

1153
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,833
I don't know. Come here.

1154
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:14,208
- Can we reschedule it?
- Don't know, I have to check with them.

1155
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:18,750
- Let's just stay home today, okay?
- I can do it, Mom. I can do it.

1156
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:24,000
- Laura, please, you're in no condition.
- No, Irene, I can do it.

1157
01:27:24,083 --> 01:27:27,875
How about we skip today's interview?
We can always reschedule. Right, Riko?

1158
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:30,625
The appointment is today.
But if you want to reschedule--

1159
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,541
- I can go.
- We have to check with them.

1160
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:36,208
- No, they will understand.
- No, Irene. I want to do it today.

1161
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,458
Let's go.

1162
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,541
Please help carry her, Riko.

1163
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:51,916
Okay, slowly.

1164
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,833
Careful, careful.

1165
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,791
Are you sure you can do this?

1166
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,500
- It's okay if you can't.
- I can.

1167
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:06,666
- Yeah, if you want to rest, it's okay.
- No, just give me short questions.

1168
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,875
No, we're just chatting here.

1169
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:11,458
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1170
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,625
- Okay, shall we start?
- Yes, let's.

1171
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:21,666
Laura, what have you learned
from everything you've experienced?

1172
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,625
Honestly, I learned that

1173
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:28,375
my family are the ones who
really care about me.

1174
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,083
Sorry for asking this,

1175
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:38,583
but with your current condition,
can you still be happy?

1176
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,875
Yes, I can.

1177
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,708
- Not just pretending to be happy?
- No.

1178
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:46,333
How would you do that?

1179
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:49,458
"Type REG space…"

1180
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:53,958
Laura wants justice.

1181
01:28:55,208 --> 01:29:00,583
If Jojo ends up in prison,
what do you plan to do?

1182
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:02,833
Enough.

1183
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:11,500
The East Jakarta District Court
has ruled that

1184
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:13,708
the defendant, Jonathan Gunandi

1185
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:20,000
is found guilty as charged for the act of

1186
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,375
driving a vehicle recklessly,

1187
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:26,708
which due to their negligence,
resulted in an accident

1188
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:28,916
that caused serious
injury to the plaintiff.

1189
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,291
The court sentences the defendant to
four years and six months in prison.

1190
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:36,916
The defendant must also
pay a fine of 10 million Rupiah.

1191
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:53,833
Irene.

1192
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,375
Irene.

1193
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,666
Can you adjust my position?

1194
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:01,875
Straighten it up a bit.

1195
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,250
Hang on.

1196
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:18,375
- That's good.
- Okay.

1197
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:20,708
- Better?
- Yeah.

1198
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:23,916
Thanks, Irene.

1199
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:26,666
For putting up with me.

1200
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:28,375
Of course.

1201
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:32,083
I'm gonna stay with you until you sleep.

1202
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:05,583
Irene.

1203
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:08,833
Irene.

1204
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:33,833
Irene?

1205
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:36,208
Irene.

1206
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:57,583
Irene.

1207
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:18,041
Irene!

1208
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,625
Irene, I can stand up!

1209
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:21,625
Irene.

1210
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,083
Irene.

1211
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:41,583
Irene!

1212
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:43,583
Irene!

1213
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,291
Irene!

1214
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:48,208
Mom, what is it?

1215
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,833
Mom. What's going on? Mom?

1216
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:56,083
- Laura…
- What happened to Laura?

1217
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:59,333
What happened to Laura, Mom?
Laura? Laura?

1218
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:01,000
Laura?

1219
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,958
Laura!

1220
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,291
Laura!

1221
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:08,541
Laura…

1222
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,625
Riko, hurry!

1223
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:25,708
She's drooling, Mom!

1224
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:28,291
Slap her face to wake her! Please!

1225
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:29,750
- Laura?
- Laura?

1226
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:32,750
Faster, Riko!

1227
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:34,500
Laura!

1228
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,916
Riko, faster!

1229
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:02,500
Thank you for always

EDELENYI LAURA ANNA
20 SEPTEMBER 2000 - 15 DECEMBER 2021

1231
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:04,083
I always ask myself.
Do you like your life now or before?

1232
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,875
I liked my life before,

1233
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:08,000
but I'm happier now.

1234
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:15,083
Because now I can appreciate
and be grateful of who I am today.

1235
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:16,750
Am I sad?

1236
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,500
Of course I am.

1237
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,666
But I can't wallow in the sadness.

1238
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:25,166
We all have to move on,
and never give up. Okay?

1239
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:26,625
"Greetings from Binjai!"

1240
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:07,916
Hi guys.

1241
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:23,083
- Hello.
- Hello.

1242
01:43:05,958 --> 01:43:08,458
What kind of self-defense class is this?

1243
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,375
- Okay, let's just get to the point.
- Okay, let's go.

1244
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:15,708
Do you want to talk, or…?

1245
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:18,916
You talk. I need to catch my breath.

1246
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:21,125
More oxygen, please.

1247
01:43:21,208 --> 01:43:25,000
Thank you so much for all your support
for Laura. Say thank you.

1248
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:26,791
Thank you!

1249
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,291
Bye!
