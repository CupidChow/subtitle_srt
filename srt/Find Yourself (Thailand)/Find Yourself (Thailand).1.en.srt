1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,010
(Do you believe in love at first sight?)

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,160
(You fall in love just at first meeting)

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,430
(or feel a spark as soon as you see his face.)

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,700
(You know right away that person is right for you.)

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,040
(When you two lock eyes,)

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,610
(the world stops spinning.)

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,200
Hello, Ms. Yin.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,690
Hello.

9
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,480
Did I keep you waiting for long?

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,910
Yes.

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,670
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,110
I had an urgent meeting.

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,680
This is our first date, but you were already late?

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,150
But I was just 15 minutes late.

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,860
But it isn't nice of you

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,860
to keep a woman waiting for you like this.

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,620
I have 15 minutes.

18
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,620
Please do anything to impress me.

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,020
Impress you?

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,340
Okay.

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,930
I graduated from the UK

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,050
and now own 5 companies.

23
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,230
Now, I'm traveling back and forth between Bangkok and...

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,460
(Have you ever wondered if love at first sight really exists?)

25
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,930
(Or is it all in our heads?)

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,020
I now own 3 supercars.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm planning to buy another one at the end of this year.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,350
Please stop.

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,170
But it's not yet 15 minutes.

30
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,680
The rest 10 minutes is valuable.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
I'd better spend it on walking back to the office.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,550
Thank you for treating me to this.

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,750
(If it doesn't feel right since our first meeting,)

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,150
(it can't be right, no matter what.)

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,710
(It's true, isn't it? )

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,930
Champ.

37
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,840
How is it going?

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,940
Ms. Kratae is so demanding.

39
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,320
She keeps asking me to change the design.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,390
Come on.

41
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,390
She's our client.

42
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,330
Anyway.

43
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,140
Let's finish it in time.

44
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,520
How was it, Yin?

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,580
Opal.

46
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,369
How is it going about the budget I asked you to follow up

47
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:30,980
with the client?

48
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,620
After Champ finalizes the design,

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,420
I'll quickly send it to you.

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,160
Nice.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,450
Yin,

52
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,050
how was today?

53
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,540
Sandy.

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,690
I have a conference call with our big boss this afternoon.

55
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,930
I don't have any appointments then, right?

56
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,670
You don't.

57
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,800
You're free this afternoon, Yin.

58
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,220
Yin.

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,600
How was it?

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,650
What did she say?

61
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,840
She hasn't told me yet.

62
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,090
I can't even guess.

63
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,870
Champ, will you play your bet or not?

64
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm closing it soon.

65
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,550
500 baht.

66
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,520
I bet she failed.

67
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,220
Failed?

68
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
Champ, why are you so mean?

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,680
It's obvious, isn't it?

70
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,340
If my guess is correct,

71
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,370
go out for dinner with me this evening, okay?

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,250
I already have a date.

73
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,140
With whom?

74
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,070
It's not your business.

75
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,940
How about you, Sandy?

76
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,430
Will you play your bet?

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,670
What's your guess?

78
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,700
Will you go with yes or no?

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,990
500 baht.

80
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,590
Same guess with Champ's.

81
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,780
What?

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,890
You said I'm mean, didn't you?

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,120
Why did you copy my guess?

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,890
I want some money for Botox.

85
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,280
Oho.

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
You're already beautiful, aren't you?

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,060
Come in.

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,770
Boss.

89
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,220
Yes?

90
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,810
You'll have to interview internship students.

91
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,290
I've already screened some for you.

92
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,810
Let me have a look.

93
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,020
Whoa.

94
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,140
Everyone you picked is a similar type.

95
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,940
Come on, boss.

96
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,620
I just picked them based on my sense.

97
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,370
Based on your sense or your taste?

98
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,430
I used both.

99
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,040
But there's one Mr.Yang particularly recommended.

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,720
Really?

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,610
Which one?

102
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,230
Excuse me.

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,320
This one.

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,910
His name is Shane, currently in his fifth year.

105
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,010
He's exactly majoring in interior design.

106
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,400
His portfolio is interesting, too.

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,230
Okay.

108
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,800
I'll interview him then.

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,990
Or else Yang will keep complaining.

110
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,140
Sure, boss.

111
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,920
Done.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,150
Eh?

113
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,980
Why? Is something wrong?

114
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,020
Did I forget anything?

115
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,600
Well, how was your date?

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm still single.

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm sorry to hear that.

118
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,910
We're rooting for you.

119
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,020
Yeah.

120
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,780
Eh?

121
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,140
We?

122
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,340
How much?

123
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,520
Yes?

124
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,930
How much did you guys bet?

125
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,800
Well,

126
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,190
it's around 2,000 baht this time.

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,370
Hey.

128
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,360
Do you guys see me as a casino or what?

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,680
Boss, please don't be angry with us.

130
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,190
Why would I be angry?

131
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,680
Aww.

132
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,990
Thank you.

133
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,760
Our boss is beautiful and also lovely.

134
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,360
Go now.

135
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,540
Get back to your work already.

136
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,950
Sure.

137
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,930
Boss, but I mean it.

138
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,920
We're rooting for you to finally meet the right person.

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,440
(But it's not that easy to find the right person, you know.)

140
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,670
Oh? Professor Yang?

141
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,920
Hello.

142
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,100
Hi.

143
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Hey, Shane.

144
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,370
Take a seat.

145
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,010
Professor.

146
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,750
Look at how you dressed up.

147
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,240
Are you actually here to help me

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,910
or to flirt with girls?

149
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,430
Just let me do that a bit, okay?

150
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,200
Hey, are you too nervous?

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,130
Nervous?

152
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,760
Me?

153
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,900
You're looking this awkward.

154
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,580
Well, it's normal, isn't it?

155
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,610
It's my first job interview, you know.

156
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,350
Don't be nervous.

157
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,280
If my sister sees you looking awkward

158
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,380
and faltering like this,

159
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,120
you'll surely be done for.

160
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,070
Your sister is more mean than you are?

161
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,070
Let's not say she's mean.

162
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,070
But she's super strict.

163
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,480
I see.

164
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,940
She's strict.

165
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,890
I'll keep this in mind.

166
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,820
Shane?

167
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,490
You're Shane, right?

168
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,150
Yes.

169
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,910
Please wait in the meeting room.

170
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,410
Mr. Yang,

171
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,220
would you like to go with him?

172
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,480
I won't.

173
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,210
Would you like anything else?

174
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,980
I'll bring it for you.

175
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,440
One more, please.

176
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,060
Sure. I'll bring it for you.

177
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,040
Your regular one, right?

178
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,160
Yes, please.

179
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,730
Shane, please wait in the room first.

180
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,920
Be careful. You obviously aren't blinking at all, Prof.

181
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,490
Shane.

182
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,790
It's an honor that our boss,

183
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,720
Ms.Yin, is here to interview you herself.

184
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,460
Hello, Ms.Yin.

185
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,430
So he is the one Yang recommended?

186
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,850
This is Champ, the head of the design apartment.

187
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,980
Hello, Mr.Champ.

188
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,250
Are you really in your senior year?

189
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,290
You still look young.

190
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,470
Thank you.

191
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,780
Why do you want to be an intern here?

193
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
There are many other companies out there.

194
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,430
Or did you choose this company

195
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,900
because you know I'm your professor's sister?

196
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,480
That's not the reason.

197
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,970
I chose this company because

198
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,140
I'm impressed by the works produced by WE Design

199
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,700
and its personnel.

200
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,730
Are you talking about me?

201
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,730
I'm talking about Yin,

202
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,010
the first female MD of WE Design.

203
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,360
She's got her MD position since she was 33.

204
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,550
For over 5 years of working at this company,

205
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,730
she has excelled at work

206
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,530
by providing various interior designs for famous people

207
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,660
and influencers.

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,580
The selling point of WE Design is designing condominiums

209
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,050
and one-unit shophouses.

210
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,780
The company is capable of designing small spaces

211
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,680
to maximize their utility

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,790
at reasonable prices.

213
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,360
Yang briefed you on this?

214
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
He didn't.

215
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,760
Actually, I chose to major in interior design

216
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,090
because I was impressed by WE Design's works which have been awarded.

217
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,800
Hey.

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,530
Other students who joined the interview also gave such answers.

219
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,450
What makes you more special than others?

220
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,370
Why should we select you?

221
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,850
I didn't know that

222
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,690
there are also others who are especially interested in you

223
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,980
more than I am.

224
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,820
I'm talking about the aspect of work.

225
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,500
But what if I say

226
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,610
I know your company's weakness?

227
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,570
What is it?

228
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,680
Let me make it clear that

229
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,330
this question won't affect the interview result.

230
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,870
It will.

231
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,320
If I think what you say is not correct,

232
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,580
I'll consider that you have a negative attitude towards the company.

233
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,070
We shouldn't accept someone who views the company negatively

234
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,730
as our intern.

235
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,330
Am I right?

236
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,910
What if it's correct?

237
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,910
That shows you understand our company well enough

238
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,000
and deserve the opportunity from us.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,700
Even if it's your thought alone?

240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,070
Correct.

241
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,890
That's because I'm both the rule

242
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,560
and the rule enforcer of this company.

243
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Are you ready to answer now?

244
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,890
I'm ready, of course,

245
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,500
but I'm not sure if all of you are ready to listen to it.

246
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,040
Shane, don't worry.

247
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,630
You already did well.

248
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,040
Thank you.

249
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,250
Professor, you're joking, aren't you?

250
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,550
I'm not joking.

251
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,560
When my mom gave birth to my sister,

252
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,860
she probably had too much stress.

253
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,990
That's why my sister is full of seriousness hormones.

254
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,780
You're teasing my boss.

255
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,770
I'm not.

256
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,810
Oh, is this Shane you talked about?

257
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,370
Shane, this is Opal.

258
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,570
She was once an intern here and she's got a job here.

259
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,520
Take her as an example

260
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,200
in case you need some advice.

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,480
You're overstating, Professor.

262
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,170
How was the interview, by the way?

263
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,670
Did everything go well?

264
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,220
Well....

265
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,240
Don't worry.

266
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,750
This is what our office is like.

267
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,140
I guess our boss told you off seriously.

268
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,780
A bit.

269
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,520
Prof, I'll go back now.

270
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,410
Hey, don't leave yet.

271
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,150
Take a seat.

272
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,800
I'll say hi to my sister.

273
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,950
Wait a second.

274
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,810
Sis.

275
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,300
I've heard you scared the intern out of his wits.

276
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
I did that to everyone.

277
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,660
We're accepting them to work,

278
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,950
not for a trip.

279
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,140
By the way,

280
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,950
why didn't you send any female students to be interns here this year?

281
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,290
I wanted to,

282
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,030
but nobody agreed to come.

283
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,480
They're all scared of you.

284
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,260
Scared?

285
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,250
Why?

286
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,820
When you gave a lecture at my faculty that time,

287
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,390
you scolded the student who showed up late.

288
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,770
Nobody wants to work here anymore.

289
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,740
What?

290
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,340
But that student was really wrong.

291
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,110
What's so special about him?

292
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,028
I couldn't remember when you

293
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,894
last sent a male student to be an intern here.

294
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,100
You're exaggerating.

295
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,500
I chose him

296
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,580
because he's hard-working and responsible.

297
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
He's also more mature than others.

298
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,690
Most importantly,

299
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,510
he requested to work here.

300
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,040
He chose it himself?

301
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,760
He's determined to work here?

302
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,470
Usually, my students won't specify the company they want to work at,

303
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,010
but Shane specified that he wanted to be an intern here.

304
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,080
He insisted that it must be this company.

305
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,220
Opal,

306
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,520
how is it like working here?

307
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,440
It's nice.

308
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,220
Our boss is friendly.

309
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,480
She also treats university interns as her employees.

310
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,220
Oh, here is a golden rule for this office.

311
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,740
Yes.

312
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,250
Punctuality.

313
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,020
Our boss doesn't like it when someone is late for work.

314
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,600
She hates it, actually.

315
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,050
I'm highlighting this.

316
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,910
Okay.

317
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,590
I'll get back to work.

318
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,610
Hope to see you here.

319
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,880
Yes.

320
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,550
Actually, Shane's profile is outstanding.

321
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,030
If he applies for an internship at other big companies,

322
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,240
I think he will be accepted.

323
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,520
You're right.

324
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,940
That's why I have no quota for female students this time.

325
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,370
Is the secretary in front of your room new here?

326
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,580
She's pretty.

327
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,290
That's Sandy, the same secretary.

328
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,730
She probably got her face some treatments.

329
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,150
That's why you can't remember her.

330
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,700
She's pretty anyway.

331
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,410
Come on.

332
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,810
Bring it down a notch.

333
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,680
Anyway.

334
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,810
Won't you ask me

335
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,850
how the interview with the student you sent went?

336
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,967
Just bringing him for an internship here

337
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,880
already made my mission complete.

338
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,410
Now, it's up to you whether you will accept him or not.

339
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,880
I'm leaving.

340
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,910
See you at home.

341
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,170
Bye-bye.

342
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,700
(Internship Application Form)

343
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm ready, of course,

344
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,430
but I'm not sure

345
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,270
if all of you are ready to listen to it.

346
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,110
Although WE Design is known for quality work,

347
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,760
and the figure clearly shows

348
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,600
that the company witnessed growth yearly after Ms.Yin became the MD,

349
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,480
after the outbreak of COVID-19,

350
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,790
the market became more narrow.

351
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,360
The revenue also decreased

352
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,800
because WE Design still focuses on

353
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,470
its existing client groups.

354
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,120
In reality,

355
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,730
your competitors are not limited to those on the same tier.

356
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,150
After the pandemic,

357
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,200
everyone was affected.

358
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
That results in companies in higher tiers

359
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
targeting this market too.

360
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,600
I believe you've already realized this problem, Ms.Yin.

361
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,850
If WE Design still sticks to its usual concepts

362
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,540
and the same design styles

363
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
without targeting new markets,

364
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,400
I don't find it surprising if

365
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,830
you have to bear higher costs

366
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,010
as a result of petrol prices

367
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,600
and issues with transportation between countries.

368
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,240
That's why I'm confident that

369
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,220
WE Design must go through a big change to keep pace with this real soon.

370
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,740
Are you saying that

371
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,340
what we have been doing all along is wrong?

372
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,410
I'm not.

373
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,680
I mean, it's probably time for the company to change.

374
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,430
What should we change?

375
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,430
I don't know.

376
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,800
To put it simply,

377
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,720
I don't want to judge from my perspective as an outsider.

378
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,170
But if I work as an intern here,

379
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,780
get to immerse myself in your organizational culture,

380
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,440
and see the work process and potential of your staff,

381
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,340
I'm confident

382
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,680
I can figure out a solution for you more clearly.

383
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,770
Come on.

384
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,410
You just want us to accept you as an intern.

385
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,490
That's it for the interview.

386
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,490
Please allow us a little more time to consider this.

387
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,490
We'll get back to you soon.

388
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,510
Boss, you aren't going home yet?

389
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,270
Yeah.

390
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,260
I'll sit back for a while.

391
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,500
I'll wait until there's less traffic and go back.

392
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,710
Here.

393
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,490
Please take care of it for me.

394
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,320
Sure.

395
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,910
Boss!

396
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,360
It's Shane!

397
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,220
You made such a smart choice, boss.

398
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,260
Don't worry at all.

399
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,380
I'll take care of him.

400
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,900
Get home safe.

401
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,490
How happy I am.

402
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,310
Oh.

403
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,310
The traffic was terrible.

404
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,480
It took me forever to get home.

405
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,820
Really?

406
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,610
After work, I chilled out at the office.

407
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,530
I just left the office not long ago

408
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,180
but arrived before you did.

409
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,300
The traffic was really terrible, you know.

410
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,460
By the way,

411
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,680
your secretary called me already.

412
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,030
Yang!

413
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,710
Stop talking about work already.

414
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,600
Eat.

415
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,960
I'm sorry, Mama.

416
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,080
Yin,

417
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,510
how was your date today?

418
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,650
Nothing much.

419
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,500
It just wasn't right.

420
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,370
He picked the time himself but showed up late.

421
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,220
He kept me waiting, while this was just our first date.

422
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,920
Come on.

423
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,270
Why isn't the younger generation as patient as us?

424
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,180
You guys are different from us back then.

425
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,490
What?

426
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,380
Back then,

427
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,510
we were...

428
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,920
You kept waiting until

429
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,670
Grandpa allowed you to talk to her.

430
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,630
Am I right, Papa?

431
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,420
You're right.

432
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,090
True.

433
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,720
Honestly,

434
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,490
I wanted to talk to him from the start, you know.

435
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,490
But as a girl,

436
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,680
I mustn't be too expressive.

437
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,350
Eh?

438
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,210
Or is what Yin did already the right thing?

439
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,630
Yeah. That's right.

440
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,020
I did the right thing.

441
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,160
But I think you're pretty old now.

442
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
How old are you this year?

443
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,010
38?

444
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,290
You're turning 39 next year.

445
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,080
Am I right?

446
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,190
Come on. She's just 37.

447
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,920
Don't say that.

448
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,560
Hey, you're mistaking it.

449
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I gave birth to her myself.

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,070
She's 38.

451
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,200
Mama.

452
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,840
What?

453
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,730
Stop it already.

454
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,040
Don't repeat how old I am, okay?

455
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,960
It hurts inside.

456
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,750
Yin.

457
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,000
You'd better start thinking about getting married.

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,730
I think it's already the right age for you.

459
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,850
All your friends have been married already, right?

460
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,500
What?

461
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,840
My friends got married,

462
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,880
and it's their business.

463
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,610
That has nothing to do with me.

464
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,050
Hey.

465
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,000
Your friends never recommend any good guys to you?

466
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,660
So you can finally choose one.

467
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,230
Or should I recommend one for her?

468
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:25,960
What do you think?

469
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,600
Honey, I think it's good

470
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,260
if her husband is a professor.

471
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,030
That's a stable job, you know.

472
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,680
I mean it.

473
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,580
- Am I right? - Good idea, right?

474
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,270
No.

475
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
Just like me.

476
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,510
Enough already.

477
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,350
Yang, many of your friends finished PhD, didn't they?

478
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,300
Aren't any of them single?

479
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,610
Recommend one for her.

480
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,100
Mama, no.

481
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,770
Having only one PhD graduate in our family is already enough.

482
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,330
He already gives me so much headache.

483
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,520
- Come on, sis. - 	Aren't you bored of him, huh?

484
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,570
Not at all.

485
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,360
I'm not bored because

486
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,620
he's not usually home.

487
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,300
I'm bored of you more.

488
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,670
What?

489
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,630
You're turning 40 soon

490
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,730
but still have no husband.

491
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,980
Mama, I told you I'm 38.

492
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Why do you pressure me this much?

493
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,450
If I don't,

494
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,580
you will keep being choosy

495
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,170
and end up with nobody.

496
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,170
Papa, help me.

497
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm doing it.

498
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,790
I'm doing my best.

499
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,410
Papa.

500
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,030
What?

501
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,200
What are you eating?

502
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,530
Eat already, okay?

503
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,340
Take the egg.

504
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,540
I was about to ask if we weren't going to eat it.

505
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,650
I lost my appetite after listening to what your mama said.

506
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,960
Sis, won't you eat some?

507
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,890
I don't feel like eating anymore.

508
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,160
Yes, Prof?

509
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,210
(Hey. Hello?)

510
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,380
Yes?

511
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,140
(You passed the interview.)

512
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,610
(You can start working there tomorrow.)

513
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,980
Are you serious, Prof?

514
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,430
(Of course.)

515
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,830
Thank you so much.

516
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
(Hey, Shane.)

517
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,380
(On your left.)

518
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,500
(This way.)

519
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,240
Come in, okay?

520
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,130
Come into the room.

521
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,500
Let's talk here.

522
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,610
(We should celebrate, right?)

523
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,260
(One drink, okay?)

524
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,130
Come on.

525
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,710
I know you aren't inviting me to celebrate.

526
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,390
(Why?)

527
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,180
You just want me to keep you company while you sit with girls.

528
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,970
Just say it, okay?

529
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,170
No. I won't go.

530
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,110
I won't join you.

531
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,300
(Okay. See you later then.)

532
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,540
(Great job. Bye.)

533
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,850
Follow up on this for me.

534
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,010
Rush them.

535
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,110
Champ.

536
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,530
How was your team meeting yesterday?

537
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,230
Did everything go well?

538
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,710
Yes.

539
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,720
Now, the only problem is Ms. Kratae herself.

540
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,740
No matter how I explained it to her,

541
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,090
she didn't get it.

542
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,690
I'll explain it to her at the site today.

543
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,040
I thought you already handed in the work.

544
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,740
It's not done yet?

545
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
Well.

546
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,390
Boss.

547
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,440
Yes?

548
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,890
You have to hand in the work today.

549
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,910
Ms. Kratae asked to see you at 11.

550
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,420
She said she was not yet satisfied with the design

551
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
because her Feng Shui Master told her

552
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
the plan was totally in contrast with the Feng Shui practice.

553
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,140
She requested that we fix the design and finish it by next week.

554
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,350
By next week?

555
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,500
She didn't inform us of this before, right?

556
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,960
Why didn't you tell me about it?

557
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,510
Well, I have been trying my best

558
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,680
but she didn't listen at all.

559
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,390
True.

560
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,960
Boss,

561
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,420
we must keep in mind that Ms. Kratae is a famous actress.

562
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,590
If we don't fix it for her,

563
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,440
she will probably complain about us on the TV show.

564
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,460
Do I have any other appointments later today?

565
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,290
This afternoon, Limar Production Company,

566
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,510
which is interested in being our partner, will tour our office.

567
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,950
Sandy and Champ,

568
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,950
this afternoon, take care of them for me.

569
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,080
Pardon?

570
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,590
Me?

571
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,190
Yes.

572
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,680
You both.

573
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,730
Sandy, please inform Limar that

574
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,650
I'm running a seriously important errand.

575
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,320
Okay?

576
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,920
Of course, I want a partnership

577
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,540
but if our client Ms. Kratae ruins our reputation,

578
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,690
nobody would want to work with us anymore.

579
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,510
Got it?

580
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,240
Well,

581
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,520
is there anything I can help?

582
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,520
Come with me.

583
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,990
Do you know why I brought you with me?

584
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,300
I don't know.

585
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,670
It's because yesterday

586
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,610
you pointed out our flaws

587
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,500
and convinced us to agree with it.

588
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,470
You know what?

589
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,760
After you left,

590
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,010
we continued discussing whether what you said is right.

591
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,460
Then, we came to the conclusion that

592
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,680
it's true,

593
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,550
while you just met us for the first time yesterday.

594
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,620
Is that right?

595
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes.

596
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,600
That's why I think you can help me

597
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,120
as you know when to talk

598
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,570
and when not to.

599
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,600
But one thing you have to change is

600
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,070
you must be confident when talking.

601
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,070
Don't be reluctant.

602
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,600
Noted, boss.

603
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,310
Just call me Yin.

604
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,760
Or else the client will think we keep a distance or something.

605
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,690
Also,

606
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,210
today, you must be my assistant for one day.

607
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,580
If the client sees that I'm bringing an intern,

608
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,880
she will come up with so many questions.

609
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,030
That will give me a headache.

610
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,990
Got it?

611
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,670
Yes.

612
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,280
Ready?

613
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,270
Yes.

614
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,950
WE Design?

615
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,710
Hello.

616
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,710
I'm Yin, MD of WE Design.

617
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,070
I'm her assistant.

618
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,800
Okay.

619
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,350
Come on in.

620
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,990
Are these items all yours, Ms. Kratae?

621
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,590
Nope.

622
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,570
My Feng Shui Master arranged all these for me.

623
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,190
You see?

624
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,390
Everything is placed in pairs,

625
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,610
signifying a long-lasting love life.

626
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,690
And for good luck.

627
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,710
Can you fix it?

628
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,170
Maybe make it more beautiful,

629
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,720
elegant,

630
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
and majestic, you know.

631
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,680
Well, actually,

632
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,270
if that's your request,

633
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,090
we can get it done for you.

634
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,030
But if you want us to fix all of these,

635
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,230
we must re-design your whole room.

636
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,310
Also, there's one more problem.

637
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:48,300
These items totally don't match the room design we've made for you.

638
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,360
That's why I asked to see you.

639
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,440
I need your help, you know.

640
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,060
Why don't you move all of them out, Ms. Kratae?

641
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,840
I can't move them.

642
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,140
If I move any of them,

643
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,640
and that affects my fortune,

644
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
how would you take responsibility?

645
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,110
Next week, a variety show will film my room.

646
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,740
Other shows will also do that.

647
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,260
I'm happy to mention WE Design in those shows

648
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,650
if you handle this for me fast.

649
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,260
What's that show called?

650
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,030
Celebrity Bedroom Tour.

651
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,310
Your bedroom?

652
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,240
Yep.

653
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,100
Bedroom.

654
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,200
Bedroom?

655
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,220
That way.

656
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,180
Excuse me.

657
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,580
Please come in.

658
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,780
If we limit the area that show can film

659
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,880
to just your bedroom,

660
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,280
I think we can finish it in time

661
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,320
if you need us to properly fix the design.

662
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,750
Right?

663
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,660
For example, we can move this.

664
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,730
But...that's used to protect the room from devil rays.

665
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,190
Now that it's like this,

666
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,160
my bedroom is facing the devil, isn't it?!

667
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,640
Oh, I got it.

668
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,420
Please calm down, Ms. Kratae.

669
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,250
I think we can still come up with an agreement.

670
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,080
No.

671
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,060
No more!

672
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,090
I'm done!

673
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,000
No more!

674
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,040
Hey, please wait.

675
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,150
We can talk about this.

676
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,560
Yin!

677
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,350
Yin, are you alright?

678
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,060
Ms. Kratae,

679
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,530
do you have any cold packs or medicine?

680
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,930
Yes.

681
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,790
Are you feeling better?

682
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,810
Boss, are you alright?

683
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,340
I'm alright.

684
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,110
I told you not to call me boss.

685
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,840
Call me Yin.

686
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,570
Yes, Yin.

687
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,550
Hello, baby.

688
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,790
How are you?

689
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,640
Has the design team come to check the room yet?

690
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,600
Yin?

691
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,010
Is that you?

692
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,450
Yin.

693
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,670
It's really you.

694
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,050
We haven't seen each other for how many years?

695
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,500
10 years?

696
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,210
17 years.

697
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,090
(To be precise, it's 17 years, 4 months, and 12 days.)

698
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,920
Wow.

699
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,050
So long.

700
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,560
17 years.

701
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,160
You know each other?

702
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,660
That's Yin,

703
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,780
my junior at the Thai university I went to.

704
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,290
I'm thinking about suing them

705
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,430
because they didn't finish the work

706
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,600
and didn't agree to fix the design for me either.

707
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,270
Before you came,

708
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,380
that guy also moved my devil rays shielding curtain.

709
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,730
Baby.

710
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,730
It's okay.

711
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,070
Don't be serious.

712
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,880
Okay?

713
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,300
I'll take care of this for you.

714
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,930
Well, is that true?

715
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,960
Yes.

716
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,110
No worries.

717
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,320
It's not a big deal.

718
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,280
I'll handle it for you.

719
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
If my luck gets affected,

720
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
it's because of you.

721
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,170
Man, we're getting married in just a few days.

722
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,460
How unfortunate.

723
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,400
Nope.

724
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,850
Don't say that, okay?

725
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:00,830
Please.

726
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,250
19 YEARS AGO

727
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:12,520
UNIVERSITY FIRST YEAR, SUMMER

728
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,590
(That's the first time I met Man.)

729
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,940
Hello.

730
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,490
Can I sit with you?

731
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,570
Can I ask you one question?

732
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,100
Yes.

733
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,880
How does the novel you're reading end?

734
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,270
(I can't remember how that novel ends,)

735
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,480
(but that was the first chapter of Man and me.)

736
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,170
(Tommayantee) (Words of Promises.)

737
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:14,810
UNIVERSITY SECOND YEAR, RAINY SEASON

738
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,680
Yin,

739
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,270
will you be my girlfriend?

740
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,540
(I bet you all once had the moment you felt)

741
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,910
(your whole heart would belong to that guy for your entire life.)

742
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,830
UNIVERSITY THIRD YEAR, WINTER

743
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,040
Yin!

744
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,410
UNIVERSITY FOURTH YEAR, SUMMER - Yin!

745
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,750
My dream has already come true, Yin!

746
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,590
Yin!

747
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,590
My dream has already come true, Yin.

748
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,360
I'm offered a scholarship to study in Canada!

749
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,650
Yay!

750
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,980
Why are you yelling all over the place?

751
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,330
This is a university.

752
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:04,660
Yin.

753
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,400
Security Guard.

754
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,530
Security Guard, come here quickly.

755
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,270
Yin, I don't want to leave you.

756
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,430
Take Man out.

757
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,500
But I have to go.

758
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,860
- Get out now. - 	It's my dream, Yin.

759
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,480
Yin.

760
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,090
Can you promise

761
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,280
that you'll wait for me?

762
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,010
Can you?

763
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,030
Promise me.

764
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,900
Get out now.

765
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,560
Keep your promise.

766
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,610
Yin.

767
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,010
Yin.

768
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,980
- Get out. - 	Yin!

769
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,800
Get out.

770
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,690
After I graduate,

771
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,150
I'll come back and marry you!

772
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,470
Promise me!

773
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,580
Wait for me, Yin!

774
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,360
I love you, Yin!

775
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,670
Yin?

776
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,820
Are you okay?

777
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,420
I thought something was wrong with you.

778
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
I was shocked.

779
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,950
So was I.

780
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,180
(You don't even tell me you're getting married, dumbass!)

781
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,010
So, what are we going to do with my room?

782
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,370
Man, I won't let it slide.

783
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,510
Calm down.

784
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,750
Take it easy.

785
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,970
Or should we go with what I suggested?

786
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,860
Let's focus only on your bedroom for now.

787
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:17,290
WE Design will talk to your Feng Shui Master,

788
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,220
so we can work together

789
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,950
to make the interior design by WE Design and your Feng Shui

790
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,140
go well together.

791
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,930
Good idea.

792
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,130
I think it sounds good.

793
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,390
Let's do that,

794
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,190
so it's a win-win.

795
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,090
Okay?

796
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,460
Thank you.

797
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,940
Please excuse me.

798
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Are you okay?

799
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Do you drink?

800
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,510
Here you are.

801
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,980
Excuse me.

802
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,820
We're closing soon.

803
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,820
One more bottle, please.

804
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,040
Wait. Bring two.

805
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,270
Wait. Bring me three.

806
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,420
Sure.

807
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,050
Oh.

808
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,250
Thank you.

809
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Can I ask you something?

810
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,420
Yes.

811
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,420
Have you ever had that "experience?"

812
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,120
Experience?

813
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,430
That experience?

814
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,620
Like this?

815
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Have you ever been in a relationship?

816
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,660
Of course.

817
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,490
But we already broke up.

818
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,680
Oh? Why?

819
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,990
After we talked for some time,

820
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,650
I found her quite childish.

821
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,650
What?

822
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,360
Childish?

823
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,870
Hey. You're saying it like

824
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,970
you're that mature, huh?

825
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,680
So, how did you break up with her?

826
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,640
Don't tell me

827
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,260
you just disappeared without telling her anything.

828
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,230
You did that, right?!

829
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,680
No, I didn't.

830
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,250
I talked to her nicely

831
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,490
and explained why we couldn't get along well.

832
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,800
Are you sure?

833
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
You didn't ask her to keep a promise, right?

834
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,410
You didn't ask her to wait, right?

835
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,020
Right?

836
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,500
I didn't do that.

837
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,930
I didn't.

838
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,550
Okay.

839
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,220
Great job.

840
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,530
Lovely.

841
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,510
So, you're single, right?

842
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,440
Yes.

843
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,910
Same here.

844
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,020
Since you're sitting with me like this,

845
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,810
aren't you afraid others will misunderstand our relationship?

846
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,330
Who will?

847
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,680
Everyone has already gone home.

848
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,200
If I don't come with you,

849
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
who will take care of you then?

850
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,970
Gentleman.

851
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,970
Such a gentleman.

852
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,430
It's rare to find a nice guy like you.

853
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,100
Nope.

854
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,790
I mean, I can't even find any.

855
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,080
What is your type?

856
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,530
Pardon?

857
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,520
I asked what type of girl you like.

858
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,550
Come on.

859
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:52,110
I asked what type of girl you like.

860
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,260
- Yes? - Come on.

861
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,060
You drank only a bit but are now drunk.

862
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,800
Hey.

863
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,770
I asked what type of girl you like.

864
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,450
I like a woman

865
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
who is older

866
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,250
and more mature than me.

867
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,350
Hard-working

868
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,550
and confident in herself.

869
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,560
Seriously?

870
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,410
A young man like you has a crush on an older woman?

871
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,520
That can't be true.

872
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,100
I don't believe you.

873
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,320
That sounds like a novel.

874
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,590
A soap opera novel, to be specific.

875
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,890
Well, I think you're so drunk.

876
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,310
I'm not.

877
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,370
- I didn't say... - 	I'm not drunk.

878
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,290
Don't ask me that question.

879
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,990
I'm not going home yet

880
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,170
because I'm not going home tonight.

881
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,310
Oh? That's crazy.

882
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,600
Where are you going to sleep?

883
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,420
What?

884
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,410
You told me you'd take care of me.

885
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:31,360
So, tonight, I'll be sitting here.

886
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,410
Okay?

887
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,450
You won't keep a promise, right?

888
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,010
You told me you'd take care of me.

889
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,610
I'll sleep here.

890
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,940
Yes.

891
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,140
Sleep here.

892
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,500
Sure.

893
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,780
I'll sleep now.

894
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,240
Boy, you don't know heavyweight Yin well enough.

895
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,470
Hey?

896
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,460
You got up already?

897
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,730
That means

898
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:32,280
we didn't "do" that last night, right?

899
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,840
We did.

900
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,450
If you're scared,

901
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,700
then how about this?

902
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,060
Try dating for three months.

903
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,020
Just think of it

904
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,440
as me taking a to-be-your-boyfriend internship program.

905
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,220
How does that sound?

906
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,070
Just like how you're being an intern here?

907
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,140
Exactly.
