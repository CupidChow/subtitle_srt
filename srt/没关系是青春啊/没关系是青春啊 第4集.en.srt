174
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,280
after you are praised a bit?

175
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,790
Distinguished leaders,

176
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,690
teachers and fellow students. Greetings.

177
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,080
I am Ren Keying, from Spark University.

178
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,070
I believe that everybody has known a bit about me.

179
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,170
Today, I would like to run for

180
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,350
the president of the Student Union in Spark University.

181
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:01,840
Hey.

182
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,270
Teacher.

183
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,360
Didn't we agree to

184
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,540
select a president from the student leaders?

185
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,730
Well.

186
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,820
Let me explain.

187
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,170
Selecting president from the student leaders

188
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,670
is on the premise of

189
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,600
nobody running for it.

190
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,420
Ren Keying

191
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,870
is running for it forwardly.

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,970
So, we need to perform it according to the process.

193
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,880
Is it so casual to select the president of the Student Union?

194
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,110
She is not even a student leader.

195
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,920
Why could she run for the president?

196
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,010
Actually,

197
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,520
she is a student leader in the Student Union.

198
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,130
However, she was busy with work,

199
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,590
so she didn't show up.

200
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,360
So what?

201
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,140
Can a student leader that

202
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,520
doesn't care about the affairs in the Student

203
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,620
Union be the President?

204
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,410
It is irresponsible for the whole Student Union.

205
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,750
Hey, I need to ask you.

206
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,540
Do you know what the president of the Student Union needs to do?

207
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,920
Do you know how to coordinate the work of

208
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,250
different departments?

209
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,990
Do you know what the president identity

210
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,280
represents?

211
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,490
How could a guy knowing nothing

212
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,920
run for the president of the Student Union?

213
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,790
Moreover,

214
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,730
netizens are all criticizing her for

215
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,030
being a vase that has no education background and ability.

216
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,330
We all know that this is true.

217
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,430
So, we have the reason to believe that

218
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,320
Ren Keying...

219
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,100
OK. OK. OK.

220

There is no ad at all now.

Do you think Ren Keying will make trouble for me

224
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,070
when she runs for the president of the Student Union?

225
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,000
These letters of cancellation

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,380
have troubled me enough.

227
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,320
Relax.

Diligence can make up dallness?

241

This is my first time to see this expression.

242
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,450
It should be "diligence can make up dullness".

Yes,

According to Line 173 of the Student Union Principle,

Of course.

 -Ren Keying.

the Student Union in Spark University

320
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,160
so easily.

321
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,820
It seems that I need to reevaluate your social ability.

322
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,880
What social ability?

323
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,600

Since you are in my house,

First,

332
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,520
as I am a public figure,

333
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,820
nothing in my house

334
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,720
can be let out.

335
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,690
Second,

336
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,590
we need to unite to

337
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,960
achieve the goal of me being the president.

338
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,580
My sister is left to you.

339
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,030
-My sister is famous for her stupidity. 
-Third.

340
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,770
-You need to get prepared for it. 
 -Don't touch the stuff in the fridge freely.

341
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,220
Don't worry.

342
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,680
We have already get prepared.

343
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,240
Fourth,

344
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,700
the stuff in the fridge...

345
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,410
[Ma]

346
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,070
should not be touched casually.

347
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,490
Fifth,

348
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,300
we need to clean the room in turn.

349
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,880
-I will be in charge of tutoring her for Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 
-Sixth.

350
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,900
Then I will be in charge of Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

351
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,630
Seventh.

352
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,340
Hey.

353
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,370
Are you three listening to me?

354
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,630
Eighth.

355
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,770
Let me think.

356
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:00,980
Please come in.

357
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,440
Chairman,

358
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,730
this is your schedule for tomorrow.

359
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,660
I will leave it here for you.

360
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,920
Thank you.

361
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,710
Won't you go back to rest?

362
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,460
I still have some work to do.

363
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,590
You can go back and rest first.

364
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,930
I will leave now.

365
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,780
Take care.

366
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,470
OK.

367
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,060
[My baby son]

368
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,330
Babe,

369
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,720
I have made up a birthday present for you specially.

370
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,970
Come back quickly.

371
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,550
I admit. I was wrong.

372
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,040
Eighteenth.

373
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,180
Be quiet when you leave.

374
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,200
Since you have been in my house,

375
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,220
you need to follow my rules.

376
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,510
Same to you.

377
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,010
Sister,

378
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,030
you said to announce three rules.

379
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,090
Do you have any misunderstanding

380
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,700
about the number three?

381
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,930
Her maths ability equals only to that of a pupil.

382
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,560
[Ma]

383
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,770
[Baby son]

384
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,880
I'm not going back.

385
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,290
What would I do if you don't come back?

386
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,530
Hello?

387
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,950
OK.

388
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,670
The electricity failed in my home today.

389
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,080
Where are you living, Rijiu?

390
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,450
No.

391
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,950
I cannot let Xia Bai enter my room.

392
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,520
I haven't put away his posters.

393
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,300
I didn't imagine that

394
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,720
you have so many posters

395
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,930
of me in your bedroom.

396
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,860
You like me,

397
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,620
right?

398
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,300
What a coincidence.

399
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,630
I like you, too.

400
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,450
No.

401
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,580
Where are you going?

402
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,920
I will put my luggage

403
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,060
in your room.

404
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,210
Rijiu's room is over there.

405
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,700
This is my room.

406
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,450
I'm sorry. Sorry.

407
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,020
I don't know it was your room.

408
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,650
I will go to bed first.

409
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,100
I still have three classes of interest tomorrow.

410
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,130
Actually,

411
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,180
well,

412
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,010
if you would like to have a look,

413
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,040
it is OK.

414
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,270
It's just that if you would like to enter my room suddenly.

415
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm a bit shy.

416
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,440
I should live with Xia Bai together under the same roof.

417
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,070
Will the romantic plot in movies

418
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,360
begin now?

419
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,300
Falling in love with each other

420
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,370
because of studying together.

421
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,120
No.

422
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,420
I cannot let Xia Bai see these posters.

423
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,710
I'm not anthomaniac.

424
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,330
I have to restrain myself.

425
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,550
Why do you have a photo of me?

426
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,600
You are saving a naked photo of me!

427
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,510
If you want to watch it next time, don't watch the photo anymore.

428
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,650
Just tell me.

429
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,630
I will show you in flesh.

430
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:36,940
Boring.

431
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,020
How should we sleep?

432
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,030
You sleep in bed. I will sleep on the floor.

433
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,880
Wait a minute.

434
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,030
We can fit in if we squeeze together.

435
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,570
And, it is cold on the ground.

436
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,150
It's not good for men.

437
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,600
This half is yours.

438
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,460
This half is mine.

439
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,350
Is it OK?

440
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,110
Don't cross the border.

441
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,800
OK.

442
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,150
Why are you squatting here?

443
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,000
The toilet

444
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,810
is blocked.

445
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,260
I won't eat breakfast.

446
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,070
It is seriously blocked.

447
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,480
We should call the estate.

448
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,870
Put on your clothes.

449
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,050
What if you are seen by others?

450
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,150
Three men cannot deal with

451
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,520
a blocked toilet.

452
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,200
Look how I do it.

453
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,400
Wow.

454
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,810
Excellent.

455
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,900
Excellent.

456
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,360
My sister really knows well about

457
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,250
common sense in life.

458
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,350
The following will be left for you.

459
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,560
I need to do my morning exercises.

460
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,450
Take it.

461
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,680
Sister.

462
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,620
What will you have for breakfast, hotdog or sandwich?

463
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,170
Clean it up.

464
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,110
Keying. You are great!

465
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,530
I was worried that you would make some trouble.

466
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,950
I didn't imagine that you just fit in smoothly

467
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,890
and became an officer of the Student Union.

468
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:38,820
Certainly.

469
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,050
You are a topic queen.

470
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,500
Be careful recently.

471
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,440
Some paparazzi is staring at you.

472
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,860
Well, don't worry.

473
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,230
I am living under the same roof

474
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,850
with the two other vice presidents.

475
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,650
What?

476
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,830
Who are you living with?

477
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:54,730
Hello?

478
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,870
My signal is not good.

479
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,530
-I will go back to school first. 
 -Keying, Keying.

480
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,660
-We will talk later. 
 -What?

481
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,470
Don't you think I will just let it go

482
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,290
when you made me so embarrassed on the campaign last time?

483
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,060
I didn't do it deliberately,

484
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,000
Feng Sisi.

485
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,970
Saying sorry will make it pass?

486
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,390
Who do you think you are?

487
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,080
-How could you make Xia Bai support you! 
 -I...

488
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,910
I need to teach you a good lesson today.

489
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,750
Sisi, I didn't intend to do it.

490
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,190
Sisi, I...

491
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,930
I really didn't intend to...

492
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,130
I...
