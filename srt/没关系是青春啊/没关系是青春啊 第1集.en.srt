00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,440
longing with resistance.

339
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,990
You played very well,

340
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,680
it is really beyond my expectation,

341
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,020
very good,

342
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,579
very good.

343
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,920
Thank you, director.

344
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,839
I ' ve been working on this

345
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,980
for a long time.

346
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,520
The performance marks are too heavy,

347
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,930
the expression is not natural enough,

348
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,120
and the identity of the role chairman

349
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,610
is not fully understood,

350
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,150
which is very empty.

351
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,660
Director, Is that what you think is good acting?

352
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,680
Uh, well...

353
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,240
[ FBK Artist Signing agreement ]

354
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,920
If you are willing to sign a contract with our company,

355
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,220
I promise you,

356
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,150
I will use the best team to package you,

357
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,410
make you quickly popular,

358
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,190
but if you insist on bringing your team to

359
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,240
join our company,

360
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,820
then sorry,

361
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,800
you are likely to be eliminated,

362
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,170
what will you choose?

363
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,830
What makes you say I ' m not good ？

364
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,960
Ren Keying,

365
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,700
this is Huangfu Jing, president of FBK.

366
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,470
You should be careful.

367
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,320
Ms Huangfu,

368
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,050
it ' s my fault

369
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,860
for not introducing you to her.

370
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,590
She didn ' t mean it.

371
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,290
Even if you were the CEO, I ' d say,

372
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,840
please point out what I ' m not doing so well.

373
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,240
Play back.

374
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,170
Just because I ' m president of the student council,

375
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,390
can ' t I have a relationship?

376
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,300
Every time I face you,

377
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,220
I can ' t bear the feeling of " kick and fear " .

378
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,960
OK, stop.

379
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,980
Miss Ren,

380
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,280
could you repeat the lines, please?

381
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,990
I can ' t stand the feeling of what?

382
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,120
The feeling of " kick and fear " .

383
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,140
That's the feeling of anxiety and fear.

384
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,180
Hurry up take the photos.

385
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,880
FBK female president angrily diss the popular star.

386
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,660
What a big news.

387
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,470
I chose to sign with my team.

388
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,690
I suggest you think carefully.

389
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,870
I think very clearly,

390
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,300
because we are a team,

391
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,530
if only I can sign,

392
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,860
well,

393
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,880
I refuse to sign.

394
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,670
How can I trust you with

395
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,610
such an important role

396
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,250
when you can ' t even read all the lines?

397
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,530
I believe that the Internet is not groundless,

398
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,400
you really need to improve your cultural literacy.

399
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,540
Also,

400
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,920
because you ' ve never been president of the student union,

401
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,660
your eyes tell me that

402
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,280
you don ' t understand what it ' s like.

403
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,870
You ' re gonna get me knocked out

404
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,040
because I didn ' t experience it?

405
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,090
That ' s right.

406
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,560
Do you know the process of becoming the president of the student union?

407
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,670
Do you know which departments are needed for the management of the student union?

408
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,760
Do you know what the responsibilities of a president are?

409
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,790
You don ' t know anything.

410
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,110
What makes you think you ' re qualified to be the character of the president?

411
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,260
I ' ll prove to you that I ' m right for the part.

412
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,560
With what?

413
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,460
Your " kick and fear" ?

414
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,240
You can laugh at my lack of education,

415
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,970
you can underestimate my lack of qualifications,

416
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,640
but I will not allow you to doubt that I can ' t do it.

417
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,680
I, Ren Keying,

418
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,540
will use everything I have

419
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,550
to prove that I can.

420
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,420
I don ' t need an idol vase

421
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,710
to prove anything to me.

422
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,450
An idol is not a vase.

423
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,010
I ' m sorry.

424
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,590
Just because I can ' t do it now

425
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,560
doesn ' t mean I can ' t do it in the future.

426
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,820
Keying, Keying, let ' s go.

427
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,240
Go go go,

428
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,610
Follow them.

429
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,340
Follow them.

430
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,430
I ' m sorry.

431
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,630
So,

432
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,320
CEO,

433
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,830
our casting for

434
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,610
" Presidents Can ' t Fall in love " ?

435
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,570
Pause externally.

436
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,070
Pause ？

437
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,860
This little girl is really like me when I was young,

438
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,080
full of courage and unyielding.

439
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,950
Yingying just wrote a wrong word,

440
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,810
netizens do not need to criticize her so excitedly.

441
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,730
Besides, repair and shame share the same pronunciation,

442
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,630
maybe there ' s just something wrong with the input method, and she typed it wrong.

443
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,480
Keying, do you know who you ' re talking to?

444
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,990
You just attacked Huang Fujing,

445
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,990
she is the biggest entertainment industry boss in the city and even the country.

446
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,650
What did I do wrong in the past?

447
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,830
I'm ruined.

448
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,470
It's ruined.

449
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,290
That word means a beauty which would obscure the moon and make flowers blush. Can beauty be repaired?

450
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:58,860
Hello,

451
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,750
she often used the word “of”“to”“for” wrong.

452
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,120
come on,

453
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,060
will you stop telling me all this crap?

454
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,320
-As fans, we can't be too strict with Yingying
-Ok. Ok. I won't be angry.

455
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,420
Ok, fine.

456
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,630
Yingying.

457
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,370
-How many times do you need me to repeat that?
-Yingying.

458
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,180
That's enough.

459
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,460
-Ok.
-Yingying.

460
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,070
I am quite busy right now.

461
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,280
I will support you forever.

462
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,060
I will support you forever, Yingying.

463
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,870
Keying, Keying. Ok, I will talk to you later.

464
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:18,980
We got it.

465
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,510
The contract is belonged to us.

466
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Oh, great!

467
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,380
Great!

468
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,430
Captain,

469
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,540
to celebrate our success in getting the contract,

470
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,750
can you pay the bill for the pizza?

471
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,840
Cool?

472
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,050
Cool?

473
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,470
Not a problem.

474
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,400
Go! Go! Go!

475
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,260
Hail Lord Captain!

476
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,400
It's not a big deal. You can change to work on live-streaming.

477
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,080
Keying, enough.

478
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,530
Behold.

479
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,020
-Listen up.
-I am serious.

480
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,100
I am going back to college.

481
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,680
I am continuing my unfinished study.

482
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,260
I have been thinking about it since long ago.

483
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,860
Maybe it is a mistake for me to give up my study earlier.

484
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,920
An idol without knowledge

485
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,090
is just a person who merely makes use of

486
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,520
his attractive outlook to transmit some wrong values.

487
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,940
Idols are not eye candies.

488
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,090
-I want to set up a positive
-Isn't she the girl at the gate?

489
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,080
Isn't she the vigorous girl who covets the captain’s beauty?

490
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,730
I have made up my mind.

491
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,570
I am returning to Spark University to continue my study.

492
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,380
-To experience, to feel
-Oh, God.

493
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,840
-and to enrich myself.
-The vigorous girl

494
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,970
is going back to Spark University.

495
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,660
Do you sincerely mean it?

496
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:15,980
Yes.

497
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,990
Spark University?

498
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,200
Isn't that our university?

499
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,260
I will try to earn people's recognition through my efforts.

500
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,360
I will let everyone know that I am not a eye candy.

501
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,460
Oh, my darling.

502
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,440
I must owe you something in the preexistence.

503
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,010
Captain,

504
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,960
-you may get a chance.
-Just do what you want.

505
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,790
Thank you, sis Mei.

506
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,900
I have to think about how to report that to boss.

507
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,310
Ok, sis Mei.

508
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,120
Let's go.

509
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,620
Cool.

510
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,940
We are having the low-caloric pizza with no cheese for lunch.

511
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,630
No!

512
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,020
A pizza without cheese is a pizza without soul.

513
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,070
Come on.

514
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,150
The female CEO of FBK criticized the teen hottie angrily.

515
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,130
The CEO directly said that the vigorous girl is uneducated.

516
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,440
Her performance is too deliberate.

517
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,270
Her facial expressions are not natural enough.

518
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,430
As for the role as a president,

519
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,020
she lacks sufficient understanding.

520
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,410
So her performance is inane.

521
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,100
Director, is this the decent acting in your opinion?

522
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,450
We still can't get in touch with Ren Keying.

523
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,170
How about the news?

524
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,480
Which studio posted it?

525
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,500
Contact the media and block the news immediately.

526
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,750
Block all of them.

527
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,120
Ok.

528
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,830
Alice,

529
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,800
find out Keying right now.

530
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,860
And ask her not to take any interviews.

531
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,000
There can't be any problems, ok?

532
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,060
Now that she is uneducated, just stop making a fool of herself.

533
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,240
It's horrible to be uneducated.

534
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,860
Just an eye candy.

535
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,640
I thought she is fine before.

536
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Not a fan anymore. It's useless to merely have an attractive appearance.

537
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,820
The tutor is ready.

538
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,000
The tutor fits all the requirements of my cutest sister.

539
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,950
He is waiting at the gate of Spark University

540
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,960
for you to check personally.

541
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,390
Excuse me, please go to the Spark University.

542
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,780
[Spark University]

543
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:30,350
[Spark  University]

544
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,850
That way. That way.

545
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,900
Hurry up.

546
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,130
Miss. Ren,

547
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,850
we are journalists.

548
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,820
We want to know that if the video posted online

549
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,850
about you and the CEO of FBK criticizing each other is real.

550
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,630
Probably everyone wants to know that. Please tell us.

551
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,320
Is that real?

552
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,890
Miss. Ren.

553
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,400
Please say something, Miss. Ren.

554
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,690
Just say something.

555
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,560
Don't leave.

556
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,670
Please don't leave, Miss. Ren.

557
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,700
Miss. Ren, please share your option.

558
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,550
Miss. Ren.

559
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,960
Please share a few of your opinions.

560
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,050
My name is Ren Keying.

561
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,900
I am a star.

562
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,150
Don't ask me that why I am in a mess like this.

563
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,570
I don't know what's going on too.

564
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,790
This boy, who I never met before,

565
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,000
when I was blocked,

566
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,980
grabbed my hand and pulled me to run without a word.

567
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,280
Hold on.

568
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,890
Let go of me.

569
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,270
Who are you?

570
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,490
Why you grabbed me and ran without saying anything?

571
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,630
I am a star anyhow.

572
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,250
Don't you know that you should be a gentleman in the face of a beauty?

573
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,480
Can you see that?

574
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,830
Me. Star. Superstar.

575
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,760
Why the outdated posters are still pasted here?

576
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,370
-Just take off the posters.
-You

577
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,160
Just do it. Come on.

578
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,030
What are you going to do?

579
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,720
Don't come over.

580
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,580
I know that you must be my fans.

581
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,560
And I can also understand your admiration for me.

582
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,330
But

583
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,500
on the condition that I am unwilling,

584
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,830
what you're doing is illegal.

585
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,310
You will have to pay for your behavior.

586
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,350
How dare you stare at me.

587
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,560
Where did she go?

588
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,070
-Keep quiet.
-I definitely saw that they are heading that way.

589
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,120
-This way.
-Yes.

590
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,260
Hurry up.

591
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,360
What is he doing?

592
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,460
Does he want to do something to me?

593
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,490
Should I push him away?

594
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,250
I

595
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,590
Did we miss them?

596
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,800
Not likely.

597
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,570
Let's turn back.

598
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,740
Right, let's return.

599
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,990
Come on, this way.

600
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,620
They are not here.

601
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,840
Today's college students are really shameless.

602
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,580
Let's go.

603
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,570
What are you doing?

604
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,720
You are a jerk.

605
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,940
I am calling the police.

606
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,870
Idiot.

607
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,570
Who are you talking about?

608
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,790
Get back.

609
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,690
I. You came back,

610
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,700
came back for what?

611
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,670
Don't come over.

612
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,560
Tell you what,

613
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,780
I am not afraid of you.

614
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,020
The school gate is blocked because of your appearance.

615
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,960
It seriously affects the university's image.

616
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,210
I will forget it  this time.

617
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,790
If it happens again,

618
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,320
don't blame me for being ruthless.
