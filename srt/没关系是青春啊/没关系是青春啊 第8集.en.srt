1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
According to this schedule

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:38,590
[Previously on]

3
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,240
Their exhibition tonight might be held successfully

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,810
We underestimated her, didn't we?

5
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,540
Underestimated her?

6
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,510
If she could make it

7
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,560
just assume that I lose

8
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,430
Because I don't want to let you down

9
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,040
I can make it

10
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,090
The rest

11
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,630
shall just be left to me

12
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,610
Let's welcome leading roles

13
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,620
to the stage

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,440
Dance?

15
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,850
I won't allow that to happen

16
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,710
I'll spoil your exhibition

17
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,270
I specially bought batteries

18
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,160
in case that power would be cut off

19
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,050
You like Keying too?

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,500
Yeah

21
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,590
I like her too

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,280
Never mind, It's Youth!

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,480
Episode Eight

24
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,450
What happened?

25
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,270
Why are you here?

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,780
Didn't you

27
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,360
do something ulterior to me?

28
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,770
I'm not interested in flat chest

29
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,590
You're flat-chested

30
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,720
so are your whole family

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,990
Didn't you hear about the fact that all that is condensed is essence?

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,600
Don't stare at me

33
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,900
No

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,490
Go and wash up

35
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,990
I'll cook breakfast for you

36
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,140
When did such a poker face become lively?

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,230
Did he do anything ulterior to me?

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,690
Last night

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,000
Xia Bai sent me home

40
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,820
I was so sleepy

41
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,410
that I fell asleep on the sofa

42
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,990
I held Xia in a daze

43
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,260
It's the arms of that lifeless face

44
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,160
Damn! When did he come here?

45
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,240
Did he lie beside the sofa the whole night

46
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,220
and just let himself be held by me?

47
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,860
Why didn't he pull his arms out?

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,080
Does he show any...?

49
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,520
Although he is

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,250
cold in daily life

51
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,630
lacks interest

52
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,800
and  knows nothing about humor

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,980
He is rigid and harsh, and might even be  frigid

54
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,829
yet...

55
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,760
No no no

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,770
Don't say "yet"

57
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,230
Keep sober-minded Ren Keying

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,450
Although you're enchanting

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,680
cool and cute

60
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,120
[a heartthrob]

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,400
yet

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,020
Only Xia Bai is who you're doomed to have

63
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,670
That's right

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,100
Only Xia Bai is my favorite

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,370
Ren Keying

66
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,300
I like you

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,770
Oh! My damn enchantment!

68
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,600
Sorry, poker face

69
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,820
I've already had the one on my mind

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,700
Can't you knock on the door before you enter the restroom?

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,480
What if I was answering a call of nature?

72
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,740
The breakfast is ready

73
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,920
I

74
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,780
Lin Rijiu

75
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,800
Are you setting a fire to burn my house?

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,830
Oh my gosh! Enough!

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,510
Your breakfast

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,690
This is the breakfast you cooked?

79
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,150
Are you sure that it's not poisonous?

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,100
This is what I cooked in strict accordance with an online cookbook on how to cook fried eggs

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,810
It may be

82
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,750
not poisonous

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,580
What do you mean by saying that it may be not poisonous?

84
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,770
Did you cook a fried egg?

85
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,630
It's clearly a grilled egg

86
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,500
It's such a wonder that you've lived so many years

87
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,080
This is the first time that I have cooked breakfast

88
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,020
Okay well

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,390
I should have known that I couldn't rely on you

90
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,490
Come over here

91
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,630
Do me a favor

92
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,180
You just come and see what is really

93
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,010
not only entertaining guests but also cooking well

94
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,950
If you want to cook fried egg

95
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,050
the essence lies in the overnight rice

96
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,540
Comparatively speaking

97
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,560
After adequately heating, the overnight rice

98
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,110
will be evenly separate and allow every grain of rice

99
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,170
to be stained with grease and seasoning
-egg

100
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,740
It'll be elastic and chewy

101
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,380
Stir the egg juice and crushed ice together completely

102
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,340
so that every grain of ice will be soaked with egg juice and then heat the pan with oil

103
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,430
Add seasonings then

104
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,080
It seems to get burnt

105
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,280
Totally finished

106
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,150
Have a taste

107
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,630
How about it?

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,340
Why is it sweet?

109
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,950
[sugar]

110
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,240
Well

111
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,190
There is traditionally an argument on differences between sweet and salty tofu jelly in the south and north

112
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,220
The fried rice with egg also has sweet and salty taste

113
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,400
Mine was cooked according to the southern recipe

114
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,690
If it doesn't agree with your taste, just don't push yourself

115
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,549
I think it's delicious

116
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,909
Sure enough, he is a poker face with a unique taste

117
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,560
What's this?

118
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,790
Kiwi Music Festival?

119
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,000
Wow

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,300
There're two tickets!

121
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,050
Oh

122
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,360
Are you inviting me to the festival?

123
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,380
Idiot

124
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,220
Why?

125
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,890
I've made an appointment with someone else

126
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,610
Who is so short-sighted to agree to go there with you?

127
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,020
Just tell me

128
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,010
Locke discussed the subject of agreement in his political theory

129
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,150
the concept of agreement and the method of agreement

130
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,410
Whose agreement do you want to ask about?

131
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,790
What to agree and what is agreement?

132
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,160
And what kind of agreement?

133
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,410
And

134
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,150
Since you have no idea of who she is

135
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,170
how could you decide that she is short-sighted?

136
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,180
First

137
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,450
In your cognition there exists an opposite paradox

138
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,150
You don't know who she is

139
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,090
but you know  she is short-sighted

140
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,320
So do you really know whom you're asking about?

141
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,910
Well

142
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,530
You have a low IQ and may not be able to catch what I said

143
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,920
That's right. Just put it in a simple way

144
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
Simply speaking

145
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,330
None of your business

146
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
If you don't hurry up, you'll be late for class

147
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,510
Oh

148
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,010
I'll watch Xiabai take part in some training programs

149
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,700
Today it's his training day

150
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,340
If you won't say, just zip your mouth

151
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,910
Why did you use such a terrible excuse to fob me off?

152
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,250
I didn't fob you off

153
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,910
I just used materialist theory realistically

154
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,460
to refute your ignorance

155
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,330
Yeah

156
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,780
How incredible you are!

157
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,800
You almost burned my kitchen to cook fried egg

158
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,020
It is Xiabai that is really kind and nice

159
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,480
Excuse me! Excuse me!

160
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,570
Excuse me!

161
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,390
Don't squeeze! Wait for another bus!

162
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,410
No no! We're going to work

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,360
Don't squeeze

164
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,240
I come to where they are trained so frequently

165
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,100
Isn't it too abrupt?

166
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,720
Didn't I tell myself to be reserved?

167
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,330
Have they found that I'm into Xia Bai?

168
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,070
There is nothing wrong with my make up

169
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,340
No! Stay natural, Ren Keying

170
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,570
I should never make MAX Team laugh at me

171
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,750
Take a deep breath and relax

172
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,060
Yes! That's right!

173
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,110

175
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,900
If I say

176
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,970
I just walk around and drop by

177
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,920
and bring some drinks for you

178
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,260
Do you believe?

179
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,850
Just in time

180
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,550
I wanted you to come over today

181
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,200
When we practiced dancing just now

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,210
we found something missing

183
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,460
I just thought

184
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,470
if you were here

185
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,820
you would certainly know what is wrong

186
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,040
Yeah

187
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,570
Just now Xia Bai told us about this

188
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,480
Did we speak of inviting Sister here just now?

189
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,950
Didn't we think everything went well today

190
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,080
and we could go back home in advance?

191
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,140
Have a drink

192
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,470
You're walking through swinging arm and leg of the same side, Sister

193
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,140
Have a drink

194
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,390
Wow

195
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,340
All these drinks are orangeade which our team leader likes most

196
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,290
Don't you know that our team leader likes this kind of drinks

197
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,860
and specially bought them, Sister?

198
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,170
No! Why?

199
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,420
It's just because

200
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,240
there's only orangeade in that store

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,510
How could I know that Xia Bai likes orangeade most?

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,270
You bought orangeade not because of the fact that Xia Bai likes it best?

203
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,780
Oh! Xia Bai will be sad

204
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,490
Zip your mouth while you're having drinks!

205
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,520
It's just in time that you can watch our new dance

206
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,490
And then

207
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,500
I'll coach your homework

208
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,670
Okay

209
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,450
Come over here

210
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,220
Go ahead

211
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,890
Come on

212
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,570

[Spark University]

214
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,680
You know in our class

215
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,020
Those boys behave just like ravening wolves

216
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,610
and badger me into organizing a fellowship

217
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,950
You know, such a fellowship

218
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,700
is impossible without the support of the Students' Union

219
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,640
Anyway do me a favor please

220
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,400
Wait a moment

221
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,480
What's wrong with you?

222
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,920
I must eat something wrong

223
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,740
Fortunately you just ate something wrong

224
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,800
If it were food poisoning, you would be done

225
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,150
How could you dare to eat a meal

226
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,960
that my sister, a careless girl, cooked?

227
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,220
I thought it was acceptable

228
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,590
though it was sweet

229
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,690
I should have taken you to a professional hospital

230
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,830
Is there anything wrong with your gustatory nerves?

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,530
Or there is something wrong with your brain

232
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,350
That's definitely not overnight meal

233
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,960
It has been left for three days

234
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,020
And those eggs

235
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,150
have been kept for two months

236
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,450
Don't you cook ordinarily?

237
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,790
She has got tired of few meals

238
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,690
that I can cook when she was in junior high school

239
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,470
My sister is a careless girl

240
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,720
and she has got no free time

241
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,770
so

242
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,860
we're adhering to

243
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,030
the principle of "convenience"

244
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,420
The principle of "convenience"?

245
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,100
Yeah

246
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,480
We would eat either instant noodles

247
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,610
or some take-out food

248
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,430
What a pity!

249
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,810
The girl who cooks well has broken up with me the other day

250
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,670
Oh yeah

251
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,900
Last time I gave you two tickets for Music Festival, which will be held tonight

252
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,760
Did you invite Keying to the festival?

253
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,510
I'm in no hurry

254
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,760
Wow

255
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,310
We never thought that Sister has had such a better understanding of hip hop

256
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,320
Even Tuohai thinks highly of you

257
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,050
Adding some breaking (dance skills) will indeed make the whole dance more attractive

258
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,140
You did a really good job, Keying

259
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,600
Of course

260
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm a versatile artist

261
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,590
This is just a piece of cake

262
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,460
So in order to repay you

263
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,320
After coaching you tonight

264
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,780
I'll invite you to Music Festival

265
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,290
No wonder that it suddenly becomes much brighter in the basement

266
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,600
We turned out to be three bulb boys here

267
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,680
We're not going to be bulb boys here

268
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,590
We're leaving

You are such a pill

Who agreed to go to Music Festival with you?

273
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,530
I'm a star

274
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,200
It's really troublesome to visit a crowded place

275
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,190
Then it's a pity

276
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,680
If you don't want to go there

277
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,420
It's not entirely impossible to go there

278
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,369
Why shall we buy vegetables in the supermarket?

279
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,859
Let's directly order some take-out food

Okay! I gave in!

You

283
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,970
can cook dishes?

284
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,390
Yeah

285
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,569
I have cookbooks

286
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,810
One and a half jin

Five hundred and twenty grams, take it or leave it

You can keep the extra for free

and then invite my sister to Music Festival?

My gosh! Why take the trouble to do that?

00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,640
Not me

341
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,900
Just in time

342
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,960
I know a very nice snack street

343
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,250
Shall we have something?

344
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,790
Let's go

345
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,550
Why not eat it?

346
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,650
I think it's not tasty

347
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,520
Why did you buy it?

348
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,030
I just thought it was very interesting

349
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,250
Which one would you choose between this and roast sausage?

350
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,920
Hello! Come and taste our newly cooked snacks

351
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,410
Would you like some?

352
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,450
Come and have a look

353
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,420
What would you like?

354
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,270
Would you like to have a try?

355
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,950
Huh

356
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,290
How much does it cost?

357
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,220
Ten yuan

358
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,920
Okay

359
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,900
Let me help you

360
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:26,130
♫It's been a long time since I heard from you last time♫

361
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,850
You're such a lucky girl

362
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,230
to have a so considerate boyfriend

363
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,610
Just cherish what you have

364
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:33,040
♫How long will it be to adapt to such an ending♫

365
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,080
♫It's not bad to stay alone because there's no quarrel anymore♫

366
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,520
I'll take it myself

367
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,710
♫Sit silently in my room and hide in the corner♫

368
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,570
♫Walk on the street and look through the crowd♫

369
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,060
Take care

370
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,750
Thanks

371
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:02,490
♫I always encounter someone familiar♫

372
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,640
♫I know that it can't be you♫

373
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,830
♫It's too late to hold you close♫

374
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,920
I mean

375
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,730
it's time to go to Music Festival

376
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:23,380
♫How I wish that you didn't leave♫

377
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,420
♫Who is holding your hand♫

378
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,770
♫and entwining your fingers♫

379
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,810
Where are you going?

380
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,150
Come along with me to Music Festival

381
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:38,090
♫How I wish that you can understand why I didn't persuade you to stay♫

382
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,060
What would it be like if  two men watched Music Festival together?

383
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,780
No way

384
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,520
I said I made an appointment with someone else

385
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,300
So there must be someone going there with me

386
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:44,510
♫We knew that there was no result between us♫
