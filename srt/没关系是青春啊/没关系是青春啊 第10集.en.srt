1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
You have to believe in fate.

[Previously on Never Mind, It's Youth!]

3
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,780
For example,

4
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,660
when you turn around,

5
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,970
it's likely that you will see my sister.

6
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:05,980
What is it?

7
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,590
Hey!

8
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,680
What are you doing, Rijiu?

9
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,980
I've been out for a long time. It's time to go back.

10
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,360
Take care of yourself.

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,060
FBK suddenly asked you to come over.

12
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,310
It's to use the closed space of our private library,

13
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,840
and sudden power outage,

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,660
to create the inner turmoil,

15
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,320
make the two meet

16
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,820
and promote mutual affection.

17
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,960
This is my battle plan.

18
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,419
Never Mind, It's Youth!

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,650
Episode 10

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,040
I...

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,250
Chairman, chairman.

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,550
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

23
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,170
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

24
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,710
Come on, come on.

25
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,610
Calm down, calm down.

26
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,130
Are you okay?

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,550
Why don't you try it too?

28
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,930
I don't need to.

29
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,110
You wouldn't be so mean, would you?

30
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,100
Come here and help me to see

31
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,590
whether it's swollen.

32
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,480
It seems it's swollen indeed.

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,850
Are you okay?

34
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,200
♫ Every single look in your eyes ♫

35
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,490
♫ is like the stars in the night sky, ♫

36
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,540
♫ shining on lovers who truly love each other. ♫

37
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,980
♫ Love is like a letter. ♫

38
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
You...

39
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,700
Does it hurt?

40
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,980
♫ I wrote it down and hid it in the heart. ♫

41
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,010
It doesn't hurt.

42
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,680
♫ But I don't have the courage to send it. ♫

43
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,360
♫ I carved your name on my hand, ♫

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,870
♫ waiting for the word I do. ♫

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,560
♫ Show me your love. ♫

46
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,140
A little closer.

47
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,160
A little bit closer.

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,390
♫ Show me your love. ♫

49
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,480
Kiss her, Rijiu.

50
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,840
♫ The hug you gave me is neither more or less. ♫

51
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,220
Kiss her.

52
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:34,480
Kiss.

53
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,630
♫ It's the antidote to longing. ♫

54
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,900
♫ Show me your love. ♫

55

♫ I'll give you the only vow I'll keep. ♫

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,530
♫ I want to hold your hand, ♫

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,550
♫ telling the world I love you. ♫

58
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,780
Kiss.

59
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,790
Kiss.

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,810
Oops.

61
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,710
Oh!

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,240
I found it.

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,640
Ice compress can reduce the swelling.

64
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,230
Do you know you look like a national treasure now?

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,409
Who is it for?

66
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,240
Take it.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,010
Do you want me to put it on you?

68
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,440
No thanks.

69
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,470
I'll put it on for you.

70
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,810
It's because I feel bad that I beat you up.

71
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,140
Don't think too much about it.

72
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,980
Don't you feel any compunction?

73
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,010
In fact, it's not my fault.

74
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,380
Why did you scare me?

75
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,040
I called it self-defense.

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,580
As you brew it, you must drink.

77
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,030
Except you, you idiot,

78
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,000
who would believe in ghosts?

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,750
You want to commit murder?

80
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,960
Yes, the female ghost is trying to kill you.

81
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,770
Bite me!

82
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,420
I'm afraid you'll give me the idiot disease.

83
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,480
You're the one with the idiot disease.

84
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,740
Don't move.

85
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,270
If you move again, I won't put ice on you.

86
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,200
Be gentle.

87
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,830
That's right.

88
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,970
This is how it should be.

89
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,430
With the suspension bridge effect,

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,740
we created the perfect atmosphere for the two to stay alone.

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,540
They missed the opportunity to kiss.

92
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,830
But,

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,409
it doesn't affect the overall situation.

94
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,870
Butler Jin,

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,170
please give your instructions,

96
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,110
to proceed with the next battle plan.

97
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,720
Yes, chirman.

98
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,990
Execute the next battle plan.

99
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,890
Lights, music, blower,

100
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,110
and snow drifting get prepared.

101
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,800
The power is back.

102
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,540
What the hell?

103
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,170
Wow!

104
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,680
It's snowing!

105
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,360
It's snowing on this set!

106
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,510
It's fake.

107
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,880
Artificial snowflakes, okay?

108
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,470
I think calling you an idiot

109
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,120
is belittling the intelligence of idiots.

110
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,590
But it's romantic and beautiful.

111
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,240
Don't you think so?

112
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,790
Yes.

113
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,360
Very beautiful.

114
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,640
I love snow,

115
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,390
because it holds my warmest memories.

116
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,179
It also hides my most precious secrets.

117
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,630
So,

118
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,370
even if it's artificial snowflakes,

119
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,659
I feel very happy too!

120
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,340
Ren Keying.

121
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,760
What?

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,970
I...

123
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,230
Get out of the way!

124
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,240
What are you doing?

125
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,210
Let me in!

126
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,060
You're illegally detaining our Keying!

127
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,320
Do you believe we will call the police?

128
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,850
Let me go! Let me go!

129
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,060
Don't come any closer! Don't come here!

130
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,670
Sir!

131
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,010
Let go, let go, let go! Don't come over!

132
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,860
Don't come any closer!

133
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,120
I tell you

134
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,820
it's not good even for FBK.

135
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,990
This is nonsense!

136
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,610
Chairman!

137
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,460
Chairman!

138
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,110
What are you doing in the middle of the day?

139
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,970
Keying, let's go.

140
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,700
Mei.

141
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:32,920
What are you doing?

142
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,890
It's restriction of personal freedom

143
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,590
and illegal detention, right?

144
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,680
Get out of the way!

145
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,770
Get out of the way!

146
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,800
Didn't I say that no one is allowed to enter?

147
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,580
Are you all losers?

148
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,110
We're sorry, chairman.

149
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,710
No one can come in.

150
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,970
Butler Jin.

151
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,620
I told them to leave.

152
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,080
My son,

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,370
are you okay?

154
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,840
Mom was just trying to help you.

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,010
I know.

156
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm fine.

157
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,670
Thanks, Mom.

158
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,670
It's nonsense! Absolutely nonsense!

159
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,330
If I hadn't found people on the set

160
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:34,810
were driven away,

161
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,660
and you couldn't be reached on the phone,

162
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,120
we'd be in big trouble today.

163
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,410
Well, It's okay.

164
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,420
I'm not in trouble anyway.

165
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,680
You're fine.

166
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,570
Do you know

167
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,780
if the paparazzi take pictures of

168
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,840
you staying alone with the son of FBK's president,

169
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,890
that will be a big story.

170
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,240
The son of FBK's president?

171
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Yes.

172
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,180
Do you mean Lin Rijiu?

00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,690
Yes.

344
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,380
Very conflicted.

345
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,400
Very contradictory.

346
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,610
I was so desperately looking for it.

347
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,460
Because of the loss of contact,

348
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,760
I was desperate like a child

349
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,290
who lost the most beloved toy.

350
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,000
But when I really found it,

351
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm at a loss.

352
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,610
Don't think about who likes you more.

353
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,060
You should ask yourself

354
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,110
you

355
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,650
like who better.

356
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,250
Life

357
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,710
is a train

358
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,280
that never turns back.

359
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,720
You used to think a certain station is your destination.

360
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,180
In fact,

361
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,800
you're not even sure

362
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,770
what the end

363
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,940
looks like.

364
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,760
We keep moving forward

365
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,740
and keep making ourselves strong.

366
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,130
Isn't it to find

367
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,990
an end that we like better?

368
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,190
The end we like better?

369
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,460
Well...

370
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,710
If there's nothing else, let's go home.

371
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,900
Do you want to sit here until dawn like a homeless person?

372
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,140
The mosquitoes will thank you for your selflessness.

373
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,270
And...

374
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,840
Don't turn off your phone next time.

375
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,780
Mei is almost crazy.

376
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,050
Let's go.

377

[FBK president's son confesses his love for the "vigor girl"]

378

[Xia Bai]

379
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,000
Hey!

380
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,450
Keying.

381
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,920
You're still up. It's so late.

382
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,330
Don't you have a competition?

383
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,310
After the qualifying round,

384
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,890
let's go and see a movie together.

385
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,670
Okay.

386
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,410
Then that's it. Good night.

387
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,110
Good night.

388
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,680
But...

389
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,780
Secrets are the past.

390
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,800
It's like what Alice said.

391
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,260
Life

392
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,520
Is a train that never turns back.

393
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,830
Once you think that a certain stop is your destination,

394
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,060
but you're not even sure

395
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,790
what the end really looks like.

396
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,970
We keep moving forward

397
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,840
and keep making ourselves stronger.

398
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,470
It's not for a temporary stop

399
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,100
filled with memories and secrets,

400
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,720
but to find the end

401
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,660
that we like better.
