Why do I wear the doll clothing alone?

Why hasn't poker face come yet?

351
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,370
I told him when I set off.

352
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,350
What's wrong, uncle Jin?

353
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,490
Rijiu, are you ok?

354
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,850
I'm fine, uncle Jin.

355
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,470
I'm wondering

356
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,580
how to smile naturally.

357
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,370
Rijiu,

358
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,980
smile is the same

359
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,950
as cry.

360
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,570
They are both kinds of emotion.

361
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,670
How could you

362
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,290
practice emotions?

363
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,430
Moreover, a smile which can let someone feel comfortable

364
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,370
should be

365
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,020
the smile which naturally shows on the face

366
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,040
because of joy from the heart.

367
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,180
Young master,

368
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,810
only when you see Miss Keyin

369
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,440
your smile is the most natural.

370
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,710
Maybe

371
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,530
it is joy

372
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,830
from my deep heart.

373
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,960
Gao, vice-principal asked you to attend the meeting.

374
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,730
Everyone is there.

375
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,450
Vice-principal asked me to come?

376
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,220
Hurry up.

377
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,870
Ok.

378
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,530
Come on!

379
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,910
Hello,

380
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,040
teacher.

381
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,050
Rijiu,

382
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,460
we changed the place at the last moment.

383
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,320
Keyin hasn’t had time to tell you.

384
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,490
She went to Beiyuan Villaege.

385
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,970
Didn't we plan to go to Nanyuan Village?

386
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,500
School changed the place at the last moment.

387
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,000
You shall hurry to go to Beiyuan Village.

388
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,050
There's still time to go there.

389
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:14,890
Okay.

390
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,260
Uncle Jin,

391
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,440
let's go to Beiyuan Village.

392
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,240
Ok.

393
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,020
I've hacked Ren Keying's phone already.

394
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,920
Now Lin Rijiu can't find her.

395
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,190
Xia Bai,

396
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,800
we can only help you to this extent.

397
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,680
Gao always forgets this and that.

398
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,420
He doesn't answer my call.

399
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,530
He is not reliable at the critical moment.

400
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,450
Liar!

401
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,830
Hump!

402
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,770
Forget it. Let's not wait for him.

403
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,370
Let's go.

404
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,460
Ok.

405
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,700
♫ I haven't heard from you in such a long time ♫

406
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,500
Rijiu,

407
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,440
we've been around for a long time.

408
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,690
♫ How long can I accept this ending ♫

409
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,380
There's no Beiyuan Village at all.

410
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:27,890
♫ It's fine to be alone for no more quarrels ♫

411
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:34,230
♫ Sit quietly in the room and hide in the corner ♫

412
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,590
♫ When walking on the street and looking at the crowd ♫

413
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,740
Uncle Jin,

414
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,670
let's go back.

415
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,960
I don't want to find it.

416
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,340
♫ I can always encounter someone familiar ♫

417
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,850
♫ I know and I understand that can't be you ♫
