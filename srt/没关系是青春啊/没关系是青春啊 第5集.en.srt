00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:25,630
Previous Review

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,220
I'm a student at Sparkle University, Ren Keying.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,880
Today I'm running

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,620
for the Student Council President of Starfire University.

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,280
An eye candy who shows off everywhere

6
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,770
and got promoted by utilizing her beauty.

7
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,390
How dare you run for the Student Council President?

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,540
It's not responsible for the whole Student Council.

9
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,220
Enough!

10
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,600
Everyone has a right to run for election.

11
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,460
Be careful lately.

12
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,070
There are paparazzi targeting you.

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,810
Well, don't worry.

14
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,180
I'm living together

15
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,680
with two vice presidents now.

16
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,330
Clean it.

17
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,870
Never Mind, It's Youth!

18
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,100
Episode 5

19
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,020
What a careless girl.

20
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,840
You always let yourself get hurt.

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,020
Did you do it to slack off and avoid the learning tasks

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,030
I assigned you?

23
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,550
Be gentle!

24
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,610
The tasks were too many,

25
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,660
and I got hit by accident due to the lack of sleep.

26
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,200
What's your identity now?

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,140
To run for the Student Council President, you'd mind your image.

28
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,530
Do you know this basic sense of behaviors?

29
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,050
Hey!

30
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,300
The teacher has said

31
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,360
no one can be so perfect to be the student council president at the beginning.

32
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,950
And how could you speak to me in this way?

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,850
I got hurt!

34
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,260
To become the Student Council President,

35
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,000
at least you should have some preparation.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,260
You even had no idea about the basic sense of behaviors.

37
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,760
How do you manage to do that job?

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,730
Who said I didn't know it?

39
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,829
I…

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,550
I did search for it online.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,480
Anyway,

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,440
If you want to do the job of the President better,

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,980
you must bear these Student Council Norms

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
in mind.

45
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,920
Oh…

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,810
It's so thick!

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,800
The structure of the Council

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,130
is also quite important.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,020
Student Council's Basic Norms and Regulations

50
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,210
The Student Council basically consists of one president,

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,180
two vice presidents,

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,310
and eight secretaries.

53
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,320
Among them,

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,700
you're the newly appointed Student Council member.

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,820
Student Council of Spark University

56
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,010
As for the two vice presidents,

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,430
they're Xia Bai and me.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,200
Of course,

59
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,450
the eight departments pertaining to the Council

60
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,030
have their functions respectively.

61
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,370
And secretaries of these departments

62
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,940
are all mainstays of the Student Council.

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,560
Ask.

64
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,010
What's mainstay?

65
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,790
It means the important people.

66
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,280
Remember?

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,230
Yes…

68
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,120
After this election, the eight secretaries

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,740
are Tang Jiajia of Outreach Department,

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,750
Feng Sisi of Decoration Department,

71
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,160


72
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,700
Chen Chen of Academic Department,

73
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,510
Li Ming of Livelihood Department,

74
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,570
Wei Kou of Sports Department,

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,500
Wang Shihan of Department of Schedules,

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,910
and Wang Jie of Technical Department.

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,970
And all of them here

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,010
are worthy of your study.

79
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,110
Xu Zehua, Department of Discipline

80
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,370
Feng Sisi,  Decoration Department

81
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,500
Tang Jiajia, Outreach Department

82
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,300
Oh!

83
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,230
Tang Jiajia!

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,700
She's that beauty who supported me in the end!

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,290
First of all,

86
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,550
it's Tang Jiajia of Outreach Department.

87
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,920
She's aloof and proud,

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,970
and doesn't like allying,

89
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,030
but her outreach skills are amazing.

90
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,300
-She can handle any situation with ease.
-Hope we can have a good cooperation.

91
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,310
Meanwhile,

92
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,940
she's almost the dream lover

93
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,829
of all the male students

94
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,959
in Spark University.

95
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,550
Wow.

96
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,660
Then are you also one of them?

97
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,530
Nope.

98
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,990
Mm.

99
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,800
Secondly,

100
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,290
it's Xu Zehua of Department of Discipline.

101
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,840
He's one of Tang Jiajia's crazy admirers.

102
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,050
Though the Department of Discipline is in charge of disciplines,

103
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,220
he's foxy.

104
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,790
Jiajia.

105
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,120
-Excuse me.
-He's on good terms with Wei Kou of Sports Department,

106
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,730
-You may go back to your seat.
-and Wang Shihan of Department of Schedules.

107
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,270
They're both fence sitters

108
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,810
who choose their side according to the situation.

109
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,460
That Tang Jiajia is really something.

110
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,550
How could she refuse you, the department seretary?

111
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,159
Right.

112
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,780
As for the last one,

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,200
it's Wen Sisi of Decoration Department.

114
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,690
About her personalities,

115
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,030
you could tell from her offensive behaviors

116
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,440
in the election.

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,820
She'll be your biggest rival

118
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,750
for the Student Council President.

119
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,270
She leads the newly elected Secretary of Academic Department, Chen Chen,

120
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,060
the new Secretary of Livelihood Department, Zho Yiran, from the Outreach Department,

121
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,600
and homebody from Technical Department, Wang Jie.

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,140
Though Wang supports Xia Bai,

123
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,870
he doesn't follow to Xia Bai's command.

124
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,130
I'm engaged in other matters, excuse me.

125
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,930
Or in other words,

126
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,680
Xia Bai doesn't like

127
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,330
Feng Sisi's little tricks.

128
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,060
I thought you were dumb,

129
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,290
and didn't expect you to be so talkative!

130
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,100
All of these will influence whether you could

131
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,120
be qualified to be the Student Council President.

132
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,100
Have you remembered all of them?

133
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,990
Yes.

134
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,120
You and Xia Bai

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,100
are mainstays of the Student Council.

136
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,650
As for others, they just do their own jobs.

137
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,290
Listen,

138
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,650
I once joined a girl group of a dozen people,

139
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,050
who also had their own strengths.

140
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,980
In addition to the normal performances,

141
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,590
all of them loved to show off and make trouble.

142
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,760
I must be crazy

143
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,570
telling you these things.

144
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,240
What happened to you, Sisi?

145
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,980
Why did you become like this?

146
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,640
Is it due to that crazy woman?

147
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,830
This time,

148
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm really impressed.

149
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,740
She really lives up to her title, the goddess.

150
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,110
She's so appealing.

151
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,130
Cough.

152
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,630
Ahem.

153
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,260
Sisi,

154
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,430
what should we do?

155
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,010
Shall we

156
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,820
counterattack?

157
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,590
No need to do so.

158
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,820
Don't forget how strong I am.

159
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,050
You mean,

160
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,500
you'll have a battle of capacities with her?

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,480
Exactly.

162
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,300
In the exhibition next week,

163
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,010
so long as we meddle in it and do a better job,

164
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,620
it'll be clear that who's the loser

165
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,159
and who's the winner.

166
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,080
Come on! My goddess!

167
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,260
Run faster!

168
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,520
You can make it, Ren Keying!

169
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,140
Quickly! Come one!

170
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,080
Run faster! You can do it!

171
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,880
Come here!

172
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,740
Come one!

173
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,450
C'mon, Keying! You can do it!

174
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,120
Speed up! Come on! Keying!

175
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,300
Just do it!

176
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,750
What a fool.

177
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,600
So embarrassing.

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,170
Just let me die here.

179
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,520
Are you okay?

180
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,230
Let's take the stairs.

181
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,490
How did you get hurt here?

182
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,350
Oh,

183
00:08:59,470 --> 00:08:59,950
it's okay.

184
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,970
Maybe it was caused accidentally when I fell over just now.

185
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,660
Wait!

186
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,310
Does it hurt?

187
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,580
No.

188
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,800
Let's go.

189
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,250
Seriously?

190
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,830
Can I really go watch your rehearsal?

191
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,590
Sure.

192
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,600
I also want you

193
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,690
to give me some advice.

194
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,310
Speaking of which,

195
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm your senior after all

196
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,940
Looks like you are smart enough

197
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,740
Not like some person with a poker face

198
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,870
Ah

199
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
Didn't you arrive by taking the elevator

200
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,220
Why are you being so late

201
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,400
If you didn't fall asleep

202
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,520
You wouldn't miss the elevator

203
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,010
And you wouldn't fall because of that

204
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,440
It is all due to your laziness

205
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,050
And your bad attitude in study

206
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,900
I hope you take it seriously

207
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,240
And stop dragging

208
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,110
I told you he's a poker face

209
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,090
All that effort he did was just to give me a tongue-lashing

210
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,350
Well

211
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,520
He might be expressionless

212
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,850
And his words are rather sharp

213
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,590
But deep in heart

214
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,000
He's quite nice

215
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,780
Hmph

216
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,950
Are you out of your mind

217
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,410
How could he be a nice person

218
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,790
I love you

219
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,410
Since every one is here

220
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,830
I want to mention something

221
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,050
About next week's expedition

222
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm worried about Ren Keying

223
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,090
She has no idea about Spark University

224
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,430
If the expedition is ruined by a newbie like her

225
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,600
And when the news went out

226
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,100
We are going to be a laughing stock

227
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,720
Hey, Sisi

228
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,380
All the efforts you put is for your dear Xia Bai, huh

229
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,000
What if he doesn't appreciate your efforts at all

230
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,190
I stand by my words that

231
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,960
Xia Bai has nothing to do with this

232
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,660
If Ren Keying takes charge

233
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,720
We might as well become a joke to others

234
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,550
If she dare not to tackle

235
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,720
A new student officer

236
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,100
Can just prove that she's not capable

237
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,510
And

238
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,850
Stop calling me Sisi

239
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,230
We're not on friendly terms

240
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,130
Feng Sisi

241
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,660
I really didn't mean that

242
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,240
You're so kind and so energetic, taking care of all the stuff

243
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,500
Everyone's really busy

244
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,390
Really

245
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,520
I know how busy our ice queen is

246
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,000
It's just

247
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,880
You don't care a bit about the student council's public image

248
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,720
I know you have a crush on Xia Bai

249
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,910
But it's doesn't mean you can lash out at Ren Keying

250
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,470
Why don't you just save it

251
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,170
And mind your own business

252
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,430
Well

253
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,980
Stop acting as if you were the president

254
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,510
You think I don't know that you want to be the president

255
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,680
Hmph

256
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,660
You're just

257
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,870
Another hypocrite

258
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,090
Who works so hard when no one's looking

259
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,080
In public however

260
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,590
You act as if willing to compete fair and square

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,770
Fair enough

262
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,630
She's a star

263
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,200
After all

264
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,570
She probably will

265
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,270
Steal all the spotlights

266
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,540
Feng Sisi

267
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,080
You have spoken enough

268
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,150
Are you afraid of me telling the truth

269
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,010
Stop thinking that

270
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,340
Everyone here supports you

271
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,160
You see

272
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,980
We are all working hard for the student council

273
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,120
How can you be uninvolved

274
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,070
Watch your step

275
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,470
Wow

276
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,840
So here's where you guys practice

277
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,950
Yeah

278
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,120
Although

279
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,390
It's not that safe

280
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,670
The light is dim

281
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,810
And there are molds here and there

282
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,260
Well

283
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,270
The rent is cheap

284
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,650
And we get both residential water and power supplies

285
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,470
Because it's semi-underground

286
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,120
residents will not feel being disturbed

287
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,290
Thus

288
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,630
It's a great practice area

289
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,880
Do you think

290
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,880
It's shabby here

291
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,210
No

292
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,790
'Cause I can feel

293
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,410
All the efforts you paid to make your dream come true

294
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,690
Everything here

295
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,590
Tells me your stories

296
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:31,880
By the way

297
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,510
Didn't you sign a contract with FBK

298
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,060
Why don't you apply for a better training room

299
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,810
We did have a contract with FBK

300
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,870
But

301
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,150
We only have access to certain opportunities

302
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,930
Instead of getting a huge amount of resource

303
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,480
Unless

304
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,900
We got certain achievements

305
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,580
Or awards

306
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,170
Why is your contract so unfair to you guys

307
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,670
Can you play the guitar

308
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,930
A little

309
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,550
♫ Your eyes are like stars  ♫

310
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,640
♫ They promise me every second, every minute  ♫

311
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,960
♫ And give me more assurance ♫

312
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,120
If I keep carry on

313
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,800
I'm sure I can succeed

314
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,980
Instead of existing like a firework

315
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,290
That only stays for a while

316
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,770
Fireworks

317
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,580
Yeah

318
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,650
I don't have a lot on my mind now

319
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,370
Even if it ends up like fireworks

320
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,270
For us, we just want to shine

321
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,760
But

322
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,070
Who's gonna ever to enjoy a group like us

323
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,000
I do

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,050
I like you guys a lot

325
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,140
I know

326
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,310
You're trying to comfort me

327
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,610
But thanks anyways

328
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,780
I'm not giving you any comfort

329
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,920
I really admire you all

330
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,270
From the start, you guys

331
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,280
Gather around for your dream

332
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,160
You work hard and keep on practicing

333
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,460
You never try to hype yourselves

334
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,480
And stick to your goals instead

335
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,250
We, as your fans, see all of this

336
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,390
And we know

337
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,690
So

338
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,980
Please promise me

339
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,160
Never give up

340
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,180
OK

341
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,040
OK

342
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm not giving up easily

343
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,320
For my dreams

344
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,570

Captain

346
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,660
Takumi and A Feng are picking on me again

347
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,440
They call me a puppy

348
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,060
Then bark at them fiercely

349
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,430
Woof, woof

350
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,440
Hey

351
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,340
Are you Ren Keying

352
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,050
The girl known as the Most Ignorant Vigor Girl

353
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,860
It's really you

354
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,330
If you take back the second half of your sentence

355
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,190
I think

356
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,510
I will be really happy

357
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,170
Yeah

358
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,320
You're called ignorant on the internet

359
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,319
No wonder they pick on you

360
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,369
You deserve it

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,720
Come now

362
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,300
Since we're all here

363
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,470
Let's start practicing

364
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,770
The contest for Produce 100% Boys is in next month

365
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:15,940
Why don't we

366
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,680
Ask Keying for her feedback

367
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,490
Alright

368
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,930
All efforts

369
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,980
Will eventually be paid off

370

All endeavors

372
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,690
Are destined to be appreciated

Yingying's right

376
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,000
It's not safe here

377
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,090
There's not a single typo

378
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,190
It seems she's really working hard

379
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,400
Come on

380
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,410
Ah

381
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,590
A quick chat

382
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,910
OK

383
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,050
Ah

384
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,810
Ouch

385
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,620
Be careful

386
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,680
Hey

387
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,220
Don't move

388
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,650
Oh

389
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,310
Sorry to disturb

390
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm leaving right away

391
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,290
Come back, Ren Keying

392
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,650
Dear brother

393
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,160
I told you stop being a Don Juan

394
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,180
As the old saying goes

395
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,430
The mills of the gods grind slowly

396
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,800
Cut it out

397
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,180
Where's Xia Bai

398
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,720
Rijiu said you went to the practice room with him

399
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,970
Why aren't you two together

400
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,030
He's staying there for some extra practice

401
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,490
So I left early

402
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,780
Review what you learn in class

403
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,490
And there are some daily files you didn't check at the student council

404
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,970
And read thoroughly the rules of the student council

405
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,860
Got it

406
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,950
No way

407
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,240
I can't go out

408
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,380
I'm staying at home

409
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,720
And fully enjoy my special drink

410
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,190
I don't want a scar on my handsome face

411
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,740
Lemme ask you something

412
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,610
Do you know about the expedition at Spark University next week

413
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,790
Yeah

414
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,440
Why don't you tell me

415
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,780
Because you're not allowed

416
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,110
Why not

417
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,970
Just because I'm a newbie

418
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,800
Who told you that?

419
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,680
Just...

420
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,650
Tang Jiajia.

421
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,720
I came across Tang Jiajia

422
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,930
and she told me everything.

423
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,990
I may not be perfect,

424
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,160
but only cowards would give up.

425
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,870
I'm not a coward.

426
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,230
No is no.

427
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
You don't even learn to walk,

428
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,770
how come you could run?

429
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,780
And compete?

430
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,500
Do you know how to organise an exhibition?

431
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,290
Do you know how to deal with an emergency in an exhibition?

432
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,870
What if the delivery of exhibits is delayed?

433
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,880
How to build an exhibition stand?

434
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,060
How to handle a blackout?

435
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,470
Anyway,

436
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,640
it's a no.

437
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,870
Fine.

438
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,290
It's up to you.

439
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,270
I'm gonna go. Enjoy your breakfast.

440
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,990
When did she become so hardworking?

441
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,280
Xia Bai

442
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,090
asked to meet her at ten

443
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,100
at the study room

444
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,990
to tutor her.

445
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,220
Well,

446
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,330
it's just too early

447
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,190
for her to study.

448
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,200
Do you know why my sister

449
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,820
is bad at her study?

450
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,760
Because she's too busy doing her acting job

451
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,050
to make time for study?

452
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,180
No.

453
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,440
That's part of the reasons.

454
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,370
Actually,

455
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,840
my sister

456
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,760
has a disease.

457
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:45,940
What is it?

458
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,550
I've never heard you mentioned it.

459
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,540
It's too embarrassing

460
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,550
for me to talk about it.

461
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,410
Hey,

462
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,860
where are you going?

463
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,600
She must go see the doctor

464
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,440
instead of studying.

465
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,290
I'll take her to the hospital.

466
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,460
Don't rush off.

467
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,510
Hear me out.

468
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:01,650
Well...

469
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,200
Actually my sister

470
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,090
has

471
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,230
reading fatigue.

472
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,440
Reading fatigue?

473
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,530
Yep.

474
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,580
Reading fatigue.

475
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,840
She'll fall asleep

476
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,640
during reading.

477
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,650
Incurable disease.

478
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
Thanks guys!

479
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,650
The competition

480
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,260
is approaching.

481
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,750
From now on,

482
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,200
no one is allowed to

483
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,660
skip the morning training.

484
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,680
Bro,

485
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,660
I know morning is important,

486
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,950
but only kids from military school

487
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,980
would get up that early.

488
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,770
Getting up too early

489
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,380
is bad for your skin.

490
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,400
If you want to achieve your dream,

491
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,050
you have to work harder than anyone else.

492
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,480
What did Kobe say?

493
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,810
Have you ever seen Los Angeles at 4 am?

494
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,260
I'm not asking you to get up at 4am.

495
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,480
You could get up at 6:30am.

496
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,970
Oh gosh.

497
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,780
Please.

498
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,920
To comfort my soul

499
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:01,890
and

500
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,910
to not waste a good weather today,

501
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,010
bro,

502
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,710
let's go for a picnic.

503
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,210
Good.

504
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,420
No problem.

505
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,070
Really?

506
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,290
Well,

507
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,180
not for today.

508
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,390
I'm about to meet Keying

509
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,240
and tutor her.

510
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,610
Let's find another time

511
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,540
and ask her

512
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,470
to come with us for a picnic.

513
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,780
Keying. Keying.

514
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,970
Look your smile when you say her name.

515
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,870
Dates

516
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,360
before mates.

517
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,170
I didn't expect you to be like that.

518
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,950
Are you

519
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,170
serious about Keying?

520
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,480
What are you guys

521
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,140
thinking about?

522
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,700
Ouch！

523
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,160
And you!

524
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,270
It seems like

525
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,040
Ren Keying has feelings for you.

526
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,440
She helped you out at FBK last time,

527
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,660
and offered to

528
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,200
help us with the dance rehearsal.

529
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,210
Well?

530
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,010
Haha.

531
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,990
Bro,

532
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,530
say it.

533
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,560
Don't you have feelings for her?

534
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,940

535
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,810
Don't worry.

536
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,950
We'll keep your secret.

537
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,820
Cut it out.

538
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,780
It's not true.

539
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,580
I'm running late.

540
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,190
Gotta go.

541
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,970
Is he

542
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,580
getting serious?

543
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,000
I bet he is.

544
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,270
He never cared about this kind of stuff,

545
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,280
but he just explained.

546
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,180
At this moment,

547
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,840
explaining is trying to cover up something.
