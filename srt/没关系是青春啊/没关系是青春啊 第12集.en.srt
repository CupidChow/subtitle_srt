Ren Ke-ying.

3
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,900
I want to go on a date with her.

4
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,700
A date?

5
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,600
Really?

6
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,780
I can't believe you would stalk your own sister.

7
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,030
I didn't peg you as that type of person.

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,970
Ah! This movie is so scary!

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,590
It's so scary!

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,980
You need to walk out of the campus and engage in community service.

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,550
For example, visit elderly empty-nesters.

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,440
Visit elderly empty-nesters.

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,800
I will go as well.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,780
I've already blocked Ren Ke-ying's phone number.

15
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,880
Lin Ri-jiu can't find her any longer.

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,020
Not answering my phone calls?

17
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,119
He always drops the ball at critical moments.

18
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,090
Uncle Jin.

19
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,020
Let's head back.

20
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,870
I'll stop looking.

Episode 12

23
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,800
This girl is really amazing.

24
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,740
Grandma.

25
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,079
It's getting late。

26
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,940
We should head back.

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,690
You guys come so rarely.

28
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,510
You should stay the night.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,420
I will make you delicious food.

30
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,680
Um...

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,770
Never mind then.

32
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,710
You guys should get going.

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,320
It's just me being greedy.

34
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,670
It's rare to meet

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,620
upstanding kids such as you two.

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,360
You guys are like my granddaughter and grandson.

37
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,110
When you guys leave,

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,970
my heart

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,480
feels empty for a long time.

40
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,270
Grandma.

41
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,730
We will come visit again.

42
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,140
Don't be sad.

43
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,870
Okay.

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,850
We will stay for the night.

45
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,790
But we have to leave early tomorrow morning.

46
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,650
We have to participate in our school's elections.

47
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,950
Okay okay, one night.

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,930
Just stay for one night.

49
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,570
I will go tidy up the rooms for you.

50
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,400
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

51
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,440
Grandma is all by her lonesome,

52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,420
I don't want her to be disappointed.

53
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,810
Let's accompany her if we can,

54
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,550
even if it's just for one night.

55
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,950
Besides,

56
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,730
I have not seen such beautiful night skies in a long time.

57
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm going to go help Grandma tidy up the bed.

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,890
Grandma.

59
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,740
Girl.

60
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,010
You sleep here today with your boyfriend.

61
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,110
I will sleep in the next room.

62
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,750
The duvets are new.

63
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,300
I originally wanted to use it for my grandson's wedding,

64
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,970
but he thought it was too old-fashioned.

65
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,470
You guys don't mind, right?

66
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,890
No no, we don't.

67
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,340
That's good.

68
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,190
Grandma.

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,340
It's inappropriate for us to sleep in the same room.

70
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,080
What's inappropriate about that?

71
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,770
You are my granddaughter,

72
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,510
and he is my grandson-in-law.

73
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,450
Young people these days don't take initiative.

74
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,120
I have to be their wing-woman.

75
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,380
Xia Bai.

76
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,250
Xia Bai.

77
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,720
Are you asleep?

78
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,460
Sir, what's wrong with the car?

79
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,270
It's probably broken down.

80
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,170
The next bus doesn't come until after eleven o'clock.

81
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,710
After eleven?

82
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,490
Then we will be late for the student council elections!

83
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,650
We will have to walk along the road,

84
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,070
and try to hitch a ride a long the way.

85
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,450
I already called A-xin.

86
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,760
It will take him about an hour and a half to get here.

87
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,400
Okay, we have no choice then.

88
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,610
Let's hurry.

I just called her,

96
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,830
she said that they

97
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,840
stayed the night at Grandma's house.

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,660
This morning, the bus broke down.

They stayed the night at Grandma's?

100

She didn't come back

101
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,150

102
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,080
Weren't you with her yesterday?

Hello? Ke-ying? Where are you?

106
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,650
You are still at Nan Yuan Village?

107
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,670
There is only one road from that village to the city.

108
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,800
I will go pick her up.

109
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,580

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,330
I will work hard alongside my peers.

115
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm okay.

116
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,910
It's just a slight sprain.

You can't be sure right now.

118
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,540
If it's a serious sprain,

119
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,080
and you keep walking,

120
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,610
you will be crippled later.

121

You don't want to be a cripple, right?

122
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,750
Rest assured and take a nap.

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,520
Get on.

172
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,650
Why?

173
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,710
Even though the elections are over,

174
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,300
you should go have a look, leave no regrets.

175
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,020
Right?

176
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,930
Come on.

177
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,990
Thank you, doctor.

178
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,960
Be careful. Thanks, doc!

179
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,090
Bye-bye.

180
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,840
Slowly.

181
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,890
Okay.

182
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,820
How are you?

183
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,830
Your foot doesn't hurt, right?

184
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,250
It stopped hurting a while ago.

185
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,310
Be careful.

186
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:04,960
Okay.

187
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,050
You...

188
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,080
What are you doing here?

189
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,630
You brought Xia Bai here to show him off to me.

190
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,470
Congratulations on becoming President of the Student Council.

191
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,160
You are mocking me.

192
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,250
No.

193
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,830
I want to sincerely thank you.

194
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,930
You were right before.

195
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,500
I only decided to run for the position

196
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,960
out of spite.

197
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,940
In comparison,

198
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,090
you had Spark University Student Council's best interests at heart.

199
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,310
Because you appeared,

200
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,640
I realized that

201
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,660
I have many flaws.

202
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,920
Because of you,

203
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,700
I realized the true mission of the Student Council President.

204
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,000
So,

205
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,050
thank you.

206
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,130
You don't blame me

207
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,070
for how I treated you at the exhibition?

208
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,570
Of course I do.

209
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,190
How could I not?

210
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,450
But I also know,

211
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,150
you just couldn't see things from my perspective.

212
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,370
You goal was not to ruin the exhibition.

213
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,990
What's going on?

214
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,490
Why did the electricity go out?

215
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,260
What is going on?

216
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,850
What's happening?

217
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,940
Why did the electricity suddenly go out?

218
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,480
Did someone flip the switch?

219
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,390
Quickly find someone to fix this.

220
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,530
How can the exhibition go on like this?

221
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,560
You are right.

222
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,180
I don't understand you.

223
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,820
I don't understand why Xia Bai always has a place in his heart for you.

224
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,840
Whenever you appear,

225
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,860
you attract everyone's attention.

226
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,590
Indeed,

227
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,730
you dazzle because you are a celebrity.

228
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,560
But,

229
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,100
you also made me realize something.

230
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,760
As long as you give from the bottom of your heart.

231
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,040
If you truly like someone,

232
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,460
even if you just watch him smile,

233
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,610
even if it's not because of you.

234
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,480
As long as he's happy,

235
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,890
I am happy.

236
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,690
I wish you happiness.

237
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,900
Also,

238
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,490
you are always welcome to join

239
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,900
Spark University Student Council.

240
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,530
Even though I am President,

241
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,430
I believe that you have the ability

242
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,610
to continue to contribute to the Student Council.

243
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,510
To use your strengths and power

244
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,850
for the good of Spark University and its students.

245
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,910
Of course.

246
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,240
I want to

247
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,610
take you somewhere.

248
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,490
Come on.

249
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,500
I want to know where they have been

250
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,880
within ten minutes.

251
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,569
Ri-jiu.

252
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,950
You always want to run away.

253
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,590
You want to secretly protect her from the shadows.

254
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,560
But love

255
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,220
should not be like this.

256
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,250
Love should be a courageous pursuit.

257
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,950
Love bravely.

258
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,970
When she needs you the most,

259
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,950
stand by her without hesitation.

260
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,770
If you love her,

261
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,420
you should loudly say it.

262
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,360
Only this way,

263
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,830
can she feel your love.

264
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,250
[Address]

265
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,690
A bar?

266
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,070
I am friends with the owner.

267
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,340
There are not many customers at this time,

268
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,950
so he lent me the space.

269
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,490
Do you remember this place?

270
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,930
This is where the boyband MAX

271
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,590
had its first performance.

272
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,630
And also where I met you for the first time.

273
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,270
This time, it's all thanks to you.

274
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,860
Yes yes, it's not a problem with me.

275
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,190
It's up to her.

276
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,160
I can't drink. I really can't drink. Come on, have a drink with me.

277
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,450
I'll have a drink with you instead.

278
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,500
Drink a little.

279
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:03,910
Come on.

280
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,480
I'll drink with you.

281
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,130
I really can't drink.

282
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:06,780
Have a drink with me.

283
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,570
What?

284
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,660
Let me peform a trick for you.

285
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,790
I will chug this entire bottle.

286
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,210
Watch this.

287
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,540
Sister Mei.

288
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,320
Sit there and drink.

289
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,100
Come on, let's drink.

290
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,070
I don't know how to drink.

291
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,360
I really don't know how to drink.

292
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,570
Come on, let's just drink by ourselves.

293
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,420
I don't know how to drink.

294
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,010
Are you not going to show me respect?

295
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,890
Drink.

296
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,250
What are you doing?

297
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,150
What are you doing?

298
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,670
Beat him up!

299
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,570
Stop fighting.

300
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,910
Let it go.

301
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,470
Sister Mei.

302
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,140
Forget it.

303
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,200
Stop, don't let her run away.

304
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,180
Stop fighting.

305
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,890
Hurry, Ke-ying.

306
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,470
You little bastard.

307
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,270
Go.

308
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,960
Get out of here.

309
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,780
You want to leave?

310
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,980
Actually, I recognized you a long time ago

311
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,050
in front of FBK Company.

312
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,840
I remember

313
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,160
a mysterious fan would send us gifts every time we performed.

314
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,080
I remember

315
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,710
when we were made fun of for being unknown,

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,820
someone would open multiple accounts

317
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,320
and flood online forums with supportive messages.

318
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,480
I remember,

319
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,990
even when no one came to our performances,

320
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,500
a girl wearing sunglasses and a mask,

321
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,220
would stand in the audience and cheer for us with all her might.

322
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,980
Thank you.

323
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,580
Thank you for your love and support all along.

324
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,870
You gave me the motivation to persevere,

325
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,460
when I felt like giving up countless times.

326
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,760
So,

327
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,230
next,

328
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,540
I want to dedicate to you,

329
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,480
this song that I didn't get to finish singing.

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,240
I believe that through hard work,

343
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,660
one can make up for dullness with diligence, and even clumsy birds can fly far.

344
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,730
♫I like you so much, I want to spend every day with you♫

345
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,600
I also support Ren Ke-ying.

346
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,930
♫Listening to that familiar voice♫

347
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:40,650
♫Hugging you, I want to stop time♫

348
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:49,130
♫Let this happiness last forever, love you every moment of every day♫

349
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:58,670
♫Love you, na na♫

350
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:07,470
♫I want to go on a plane ride with you♫

351
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,310
♫Fly to the farthest, most beautiful starry skies♫

352

♫I like you so much, I want to spend every day with you♫

353
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,360
I like you.

354
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,130
♫Listening to that familiar voice♫

355
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,160
I always have, and I do now.

356
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,010
I have always liked you.

357
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:28,720
♫Hugging you, I want to stop time♫

358
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,880
I was willing to stand up for you in that bar.

359
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,620
I work hard for you unceasingly.

360
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:37,170
♫Let this happiness last forever, love you every moment of every day♫

361
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,680
At the exhibition, I tried my best

362
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,770
to give you a surprise.

363
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,740
When you need me the most,

364
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,680
I will appear by your side as soon as possible.

365
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,700
Because,

366
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,610
I don't ever want you to feel helpless.

367
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,350
Turns out you knew all along.

368
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,130
Ren Ke-ying.

369
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,070
I love you.

370
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,100
♫Show me your love♫

371
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:18,780
That's right.

372
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,070
At this moment,

373
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,900
♫Show me your love♫

374
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,530
I finally believe that

375
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,070
in this world,

376
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,590
♫You give me just the right amount of hugs♫

377
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,250
someone will treat your secret

378
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,910
as his own.

379
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,530
♫It's the antidote for my longing♫

380
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,040
Hide it in the bottom of his heart,

381
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,190
and only confess to you

382
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,890
♫Show me your love♫

383
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,660

♫Give you an unchanging promise♫

385
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,490
So,

386
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,360
♫I want to hold your hand♫

387
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,800
leave the rest of it to me.

388

♫And tell the world that I love you♫

389
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,040
♫Love is like a letter♫

♫Write it and hide it in the bottom of your heart♫

391
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,730
♫No courage to mail it out♫

392

♫You give me just the right amount of hugs♫

397
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,010
As for what happened after.

398
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,230
Even though I was not elected president of the Student Council,

399
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,940
♫It's the antidote for my longing♫

400
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,890
and lost my role in The President Can't Be in a Relationship

401
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,750
at FBK Company.

402
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,500
♫Show me your love♫

403
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,610
But I still felt that

404
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,270
I spent every day fulfilled and happy.

405
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,780
♫Give you an unchanging promise♫

406

♫And tell the world that I love you♫

408
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,690
This way you won't burn your mouth.

409
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,430
Of course, other than acting lovey-dovey,

410
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,810
Xia Bai still leads MAX boyband

411
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,230
and continues to train hard.

412
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,270
This is during break time.

413
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,050
Baby, come on.

414
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,970
Celebrating the success of Plan "End the Single Life".

415
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,650
Why are you filming this? Have you never seen a couple in love before?

416
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,770
Do you know that you are only together today because I...

417
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,130
Why do you have this?

418
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,220
I have been looking for it for so long.

419
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,640
I thought it was lost for sure.

420
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,020
Ke-ying.

421
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,200
I have something to ask you.

422
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,200
Have you known Ri-jiu for a long time?

423
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,140
Yep.

424
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,920
I have known him forever.

425
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,330
Are you jealous?

426
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,750
Yes, I am.

427
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,210
Ri-jiu...

428
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,440
is not your ex, is he?

429
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,680
Are you dumb?

430
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,460
Who starting dating when they are six years old?

431
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,430
Hello?

432
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,600
Is this Ke-ying?

433
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,970
I am Huang Pu-jing.

434
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,080
Even though you were not elected president of the Student Council,

435
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,940
I have witnessed your hard work.

436
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,460
FBK Company will wait for your graduation,

437
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,120
and reserve for you a role in The President Can't Be in a Relationship.

438
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,060
Really? Thank you so much.

439
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,600
I hope that you will finish your studies on a strong note.

440
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,430
FBK Company has high expectations for you. Don't let us down.

441
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,890
Of course, I will try my best.

442
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,020
Thanks, mom.

443
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,760
If there is nothing else,

444
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,440
I will get going.

445
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,340
Stop.

446
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,210
From today onwards,

447
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,750
study acting seriously.

448
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,460
The male lead in The President Can't Be in a Relationship

449
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,080
is a difficult role.

450
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,780
I know.
