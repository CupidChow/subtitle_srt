00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,970
The car hasn't come yet

170
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:09,050
♫ Knowing that we have no results ♫

171
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,780
Why does this happen so suddenly?

172
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,440
I made that decision before the exhibition

173
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,340
I just never had time to tell you

174
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,430
You

175
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,180
- You go first 
 - Together

176
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,600
- You looked in my wallet 
- The picture in your wallet

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,090
is Ren Keying, right?

178
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,520
Yes

179
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,090
Yes

180
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,730
It happened long ago

181
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,950
Whether she remembers

182
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,570
is hard to say

183
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,910
If

184
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,930
-she remembers it all the time.
-No, it won't happen

185
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,770
And I don't want to tell her

186
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,650
Rijiu

187
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,040
Come on

188
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,960
Remember to keep my secret

189
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,370
The chairman will be happy

190
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,780
to know you're back

191
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,770
Rijiu, is there anything else you need?

192
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,180
I'll make someone prepare

193
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,050
for you

194
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,680
Alas

195
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,100
Rijiu, you still keep this picture

196
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,530
I remember that I took that picture for you at that time

197
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,650
That snivelling little girl up there

198
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,860
is Miss Keying, right?

199
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,670
Oh, I am getting old through the years

200
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,600
More than a decade has passed in the blink of an eye

201
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,070
Rijiu, you've grown up, too

202
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,990
You're old enough to be distressed for a relationship

203
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,590
What are you talking about, housekeeper?

204
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,230
As an old man, I can figure it out

205
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,460
Rijiu, you have to

206
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,320
fight for your feelings

207
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,180
Even if you have more words

208
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,010
if you hide it in your heart, no one will know

209
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,830
You could have missed it accidentally

210
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,890
and missed it through your life

211
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,740
To be or not to be

212
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,230
this is a question

213
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,220
Today's big offer

214
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,870
Really?

215
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,720
Big offer

216
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,490
I see

217
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,250

All right, we will win

265
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,830
Yes

266
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,910
Ren Keying?

267
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,180
The uneducated starlet?

268
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,930
She was Rijiu's best playmate when he was a child

269
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,290
This... Rijiu was staying in her house all this time?

270
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,900
Yes

271
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,280
So

272
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,640
my son is abnormal these days

273
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,230
because he likes Ren Keying

274
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,770
and Ren Keying likes Xia Bai?

275
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,930
According to the current situation, yes

276
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,710
but Xia Bai and Miss Keying are not in a relationship yet

277
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,360
Nonsense!

278
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,560
Don't get angry, Chairman

279
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,590
Rijiu hasn't had many friends since he was a child

280
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,070
Miss Keying was his best childhood playmate

281
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,380
so Rijiu fell in love with Miss Keying is actually very normal

282
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,330
Although you don't like Miss Keying

283
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,980
the feeling is...

284
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,970
Do I need you to teach me?

285
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,320
No, no

286
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,500
Humph

287
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,730
She is my daughter-in-law of the Lin family

288
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,320
Not to mention they are not in a relationship

289
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,620
Even if they are in a relationship

290
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,640
you have to get her done

291
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,010
This...

292
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,670
I'm afraid

293
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,890
that's not a good idea

294
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,310
How can the son of Huangfu Jing

295
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,700
fail in pursuing a starlet?

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,400
Housekeeper Jin

297
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,630
Do what I told you to do

298
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,300
Yes, Chairman

299
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,940
- Uncle Jin
- Master, come on

300
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,230
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,990
Uncle Jin

302
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,600
Hey

303
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,590
Hey

304
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,370
Hey?

305
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,940
What the hell are you doing?

306
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,080
Sister Mei, didn't you turn down all my work?

307
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,760
Why suddenly...

308
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,970
I don't know the reason either

309
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,160
FBK suddenly wants you over there

310
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,260
Maybe with your recent performance

311
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,870
things will change

312
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,810
Alice

313
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,550
Not yet?

314
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm ready

315
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,820
I'm the best dresser in the country

316
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,470
-Stylist. 
-OK

317
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,410
Shut up, shut up, Alice.

318
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,420
Work!

319
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,110
Okay, wait for me

320
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,810
What's going on?

321
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,940
Sister Mei

322
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,280
I don't think my dress is OK

323
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,070
This is the costume that was assigned. This must be the right way to dress

324
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,370
But you said we were going to FBK

325
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,590
Why are we here at the shooting base?

326
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,980
I don't know what the hell they're doing either

327
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,310
Let's just go

328
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Oh, yes, Keying

329
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,870
Don't be shy when you go up there

330
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,440
Don't worry, Sister Mei

331
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,180
We've seen a lot of the world

332
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,480
Oh, no

333
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,800
Target is in place

334
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,310
Chairman

335
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,580
Miss Ren Keying has already entered the set

336
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,130
Ready

337
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,830
Uncle Jin

338
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,280
What the hell are you doing with my mom?

339
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,670
You'll know it in a minute

340
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,350
Rijiu, the opportunity is in your own hands

341
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,450
Come on!

342
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,610
What the hell?

343
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,280
Chairman

344
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,430
Battle begins

345
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,270
Is anyone here?

346
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,900
Chairman

347
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,610
I just don't get it

348
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,650
Why don't you just let Miss Ren Keying go out with Rijiu?

349
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,070
Why are we doing this?

350
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,450
You don't understand

351
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,610
It's known as the drawbridge effect

352
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,720
It can promote the further development of the relationship

353
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,950
What is the drawbridge effect?

354
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,570
The drawbridge effect

355
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,260
is that

356
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,460
when a man is crossing the drawbridge in fear

357
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,360
his heart will beat faster in spite of himself

358
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,400
If he happens to meet another person at this time

359
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,820
he may

360
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,970
mistake the increased heart rate caused by the situation

361
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,880
for a physiological response to

362
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,820
his heart being stirred by the other person

363
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,470
As a result

364
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,700
people develop feelings

365
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,430
of love for each other

366
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,880
We take advantage of the inner unease

367
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,410
created by the sudden power outage

368
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,390
in the enclosed space of our private library

369
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,570
We use this situation

370
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,630
to promote feelings of the two

371
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,180
after they meet

372
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,520
This is my battle plan

373
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,250
Phase two battle begins

374
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,240
Bingo, he is worthy of Huangfu Jing's son
