1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
You're so careless.

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:33,130
Previously on It's okay. This is youth!

3
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,860
Hurt yourself

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,890
to avoid to do learning tasks

5
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,900
I gave you?

6
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,120
There is so much homework

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,210
I can't have enough sleep so I cracked myself.

8
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,190
If you want to do your job well as the president of the student union

9
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,000
the guidelines of the student union

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,050
should be kept in your mind.

11
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,940
So thick.

12
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,940
Come on.

13
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,320
So embarrassed

14
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,490
just let me die here.

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:27,960
Are you okay?

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,220
Did you know why

17
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,840
my younger sister is bad at study?

18
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,330
Book sleepy disease!

19
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,070
It's okay. This is youth!

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,300
Episode 6

21
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,000
Shh.

22
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,270
Hey cut it out, I'm focusing.

23
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,370
Sneaky.

24
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,030
Thief?

25
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,170
Let me call security for you?

26
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,640
Don't bother.

27
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,060
I'll buy two cups of coffee.

28
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,310
What are you doing Ren Keying?!

29
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,660
You couldn't let Xia Bai see you like that!

30
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,720
I need to prove myself!

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,250
Hey

32
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,340
did you know that?

33
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,710
Feng Sisi of Arts Department

34
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,490
is going to arrange the exhibition herself

35
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,700
doesn't give chance to Ren Keying.

36
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,630
Ren Keying.

37
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,570
That star coming back to school?

38
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,620
Yes.

39
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,240
Ren Keying is awesome.

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,260
She became the student union's officer as soon as she came back

41
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,000
to take over the exhibition

42
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,020
but Feng Sisi

43
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,050
thought she can't make it and wanna get it back.

44
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,360
I think

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,730
this time the super star

46
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,470
is dangerous now.

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
Let's go.

48
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,460
That's right

49
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,510
that's what I want.

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,640
Xia Bai

51
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,030
bend your knees before my charm.

52
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,320

53
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
Don't tell me let me kiss him?

But I can't say no to Xia Bai.

you attend it too?

71
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,170
You come here to persuade me not to go?

72
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,340
Eh

73
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,630
why did you say it?

74
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,320
Lin Rijiu hopes me not to go

75
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,460
and counsellor thinks I should say no

76
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,210
but

77
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,950
like the birds don't experience

I'm on your side.

82

Ah?

83
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,910

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm on your side

Really?

88
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,450
Because

89
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,860
I believe

90
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,120
you belong to the sky.

But

92
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,570
if you want to arrange the exhibition sucessfully

93
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,980
it will not be easy

94
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,070
so

95
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,000
next

96
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,100
I'll give you one-week

Yes.

[ How to plan an exhibition ]

101
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,120
If you want to plan a successful exhibition

102
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,410
you need to create an all-roundly

103
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,430
personal- ordered exhibition

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,610
from six aspects.

105
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,220
[ 1. Preparation ]

106
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,080
No.1 Preparation before the exhibition

107
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,350
First, you need to allocate the basic cost budget

108
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,790
Here

109
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,910
like this.

110
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,659
Okay.

111
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,120
[ Boom ]

112
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,150
Second, after the basic cost budget

113
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,410
you need to communicate with the college

114
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,790
and get the stamped admission documents

115
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,810
did you get it？

116
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,420
I will say it again for you.

117
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,910
Thank you teacher.

118
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,080
Let's go.

119
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,110
The essential step of the preparation

120
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,130
is to communicate with art students taking part

121
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,870
to affirm the works

122
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,810
this step is usually the most difficult one

123
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,950
for art students are not willing to attend

124
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,480
the exhibitions holded by colleges

125
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,140
if the works cannot be sold out

126
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,230
for them

127
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,250
it will be so embarrassed.

128
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,110
Who did this?

129
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,600
Stand up!

130
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,040
Bad at other things

131
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,090
pretty good at drawing this thing

132
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,210
Quiet!

133
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,620
We'll draw the figure.

134
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,160
But sir, where is the model?

135
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,330
Model

136
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,780
the model is your

137
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,530
handsome teacher.

138
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,480
You again

139
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,180
we have drawed you for a semester.

140
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,880

142
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,840
and by the way

143
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,270
is there someone who wanna attend the exhibition?

144
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,040
No, get out.

145
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,180
Wait, listen, our exhibition

146
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,150
Get out!

147
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,390
Listen, just a word.

148
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,190
Get out!

149
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,020
Okay, let's go on

150
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,920
hurry up.

151
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,510
Damn it!

152
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,200
Why are they like this?

153
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,110
Art students of Xing Huo University

154
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,200
are all like this

155
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,330
last year

156
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,110
Rijiu and I were planning for the exhibition

157
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,730
and were kicked out by them

158
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,950
the leaders of the college refused to give a face.

159
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,460
What we can do now?

160
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,920
Without their works

161
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,820
we can't make it.

162
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,440
Maybe Feng Sisi held this thought at the beginning

163
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,110
she was sure about you can't get the works

164
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,820
and naturally the exhibition can be a joke of you

165
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,290
but relax

166
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,540
last year

167
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,320
Rijiu got the works

168
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,450
maybe he knows what to do.

169
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,780
Okay.

170
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,830
I don't know.

171
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,280
Tell me please.

172
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,310
I have got those stamped documents

173
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,570
but if I don't have the works

174
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,410
I'll be screwed.

175
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,580
Why can't say?

176
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,230

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,730
Lin Rijiu volunteered to be the model for art students

178
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,190
and so he got the works.

179
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,700
You can just laugh as you want.

180
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,730
I can't imagine you have such a bad story

181
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,490
last year

182
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,740
we could hold that exhibition

183
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,350
you devoted too much for it.

184
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,770
So I won't help

185
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,230
I won't be the model never ever again.

186
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,660
I have made my mind

187
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,760
we'll do it again

188
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,860
I'll do it in person.

189
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,020
So why is me?

190
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,850
Ren Keying! You're really going to do this to me?!

191
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,420
And

192
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,640
what's wrong with you two?!

193
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,670
I'm afraid of Keying to be the model

194
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,090
so I just came here.

195
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,540
Me too.

196
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,750
Hey, model, don't move.

197
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,520
Thank you Ren Keying.

198
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,500
Sir, about the exhibition?

199
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,680
You give us three excellent models

200
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,460
we will provide the works for you.

201
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,360
-So thank you so much. 
 -My pleasure.

202
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,330
Thank you.

203
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,420
See you.

204
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,670
Hurry up!

205
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,200
Make up for the works of this year

206
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,490
hurry up

207
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,130
hey, you two, don't move.

208
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,260
To hold a success exhibition

209
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,760
I need to choose a fascinating theme of it

210
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,060
and according to the theme

211
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,110
and the square of the exhibition field

212
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,890
I should design the exhibition decoration.

213
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,480
Theme, theme

214
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,710
what theme is better?

215
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,780
To fit the features of this season

216
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,470
and be unique

217
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,310
and for Xia Bai and Lin Rijiu helping me

218
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,380
I also wanna show their devotion in the theme

219
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,020
what should I do?

220
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,010
Keying, you're the best

221
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,500
Keying, you can do it.

222
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,890
We know you can do it, come on.

223
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,030
Firefly

224
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,570
right

225
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,130
the theme is

226
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,830
Firefly Forest of Midsummer's Night

227
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,590
Yeah, I'm a genius.

228
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,010
I'm a genius.

Hey Poker Face, where are my documents?

273
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,560
These

274
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,860
are you helping me to do?

275
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,120
Yes.

276
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,440
Let's go for meal.

277
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,620
No, I

278
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,210
I wait for you outside.

279
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,540
So do Xia Bai and Ren Yi.

280
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,110
Fine.

281
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,100
Okay.

282
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,710
You're going to be a theif

283
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,200
or to be a secret agent?

284
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,370
Shh

285
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,000
you think I like it?

286
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,860
If I just show up on the street

287
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,390
there will be tumult

288
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,330
it's troublesome to be a star.

289
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,350
It's troublesome

290
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,640
then why do you choose to be a star?

291
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,830
Bite me.

292
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,220
Here.

293
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,420
Where is Xia Bai?

294
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,270
Why didn't he come?

295
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,970
He should be here soon.

296
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,230
He just called

297
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,170
the rehearsal is over and on his way now.

298
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,200
You're going to eat wearing a mask?

299
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,290
There is no one in this restaurant.

300
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,140
Don't tell me it's terrible.

301
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,160
Relax

302
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,420
the taste

303
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,390
is pretty good

304
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,770
as for why there is no one

305
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,720
it may be not the time to eat.

306
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,410
But now it's time to eat.

307
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,650
Xia Bai.

308
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,620
Waiter, menu please.

309
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,070
Okay, wait a moment.

310
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,130
I'll have

311
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,870
this one

312
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,600
okay

313
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,170
and this one

314
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,890
and

315
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,790
and this one

316
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,960
Grilled cheese mango.

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,370
It will get you fat.

318
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,950
Alright

319
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,520
I' not the one to check out.

320
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,190
Thank you.

321
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,360
Please wait for some time.

322
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm off duty.

323
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,050
Gao, with a star student

324
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,950
it's not easy for you to be the counsellor right?

325
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,660
The transition election of student union

326
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,170
embarrassed all on set already

327
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,830
so don't say tomorrow's exhibition.

328
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,590
I heard there are

329
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,920
several vice-principals

330
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,790
and many honorary alumni of Xing Huo University

331
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,970
and presidents of many companies.

332
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,510
Gao, if I were you

333
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,450
I would think about

334
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,350
some backup emergency plans

335
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,010
to avoid the history repeats.

336
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,480
If it happens

337
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,120
it will not be just your thing.

338
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,570
I agree.

339
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,430
If the exhibition is too quiet

340
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,040
it'll be so bad.

341
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,740
I heard

342
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,920
that Ren Keying is subjective.

343
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,190
Gao

344
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,890
what are you murmuring?

345
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,570
Tell me

Give me some advice.

Hey

eat slowly

no one robs your food.

Mei usually doesn't let me eat it

354
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,300
she said it will get me fat.

It's what the star is like.

Usually Xin and others want to eat pizza

357
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,240
they can only eat it without cheese.

358
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,100
I think pizza without cheese

359
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,310
has no diffence with Roasted Naan.
