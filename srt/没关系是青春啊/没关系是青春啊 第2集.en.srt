[Recap]

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,500
My name is Ren Ke-ying.

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,260
I am a celebrity.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,500
Xia Bai.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,030
An actress who can't even remember all her lines.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,050
As for the rumors online, I believe that where there is smoke, there is fire.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,040
Miss Ren is definitely lacking in cultural literacy.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,420
An idol is more than his or her looks.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,670
You can't conclude that I can't do it in the future,

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,640
just because I can't do it now.

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,730
I want to go back to school.

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,900
Continue my unfinished studies.

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,980
Never Mind, It's Youth!

14
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,120
Episode Two.

15
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,880
Seriously?

16
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,280
You let him kiss you, just like that?

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,810
Shh.

18
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,780
Lower your voice.

19
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,800
You absolutely cannot tell Sister Mei this.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,250
I know.

21
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,000
I am giving you valuable life advice as an older sister.

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,340
News of you arguing with the female executive from FBK Company

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,210
is all over the Internet.

24
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:42,980
Sigh.

25
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,390
Plus, Sister Mei can't get in touch with you.

26
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,820
She is frantic and beside herself.

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,010
If news of a strange man kissing you

28
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,980
leaks,

29
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,390
then Sister Mei will completely lose it.

30
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,070
It's actually not a big deal.

31
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,680
He shielded me from all the reporters.

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,770
No one discovered us.

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,829
Okay.

34
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,320
Not that I know you are fine,

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,450
I am going to head back.

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,160
Sister Mei can also stop worrying.

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,380
Go back to school, study hard.

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,280
When the day comes, make them eat their words.

39
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,310
A special concoction full of nutrients.

40
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,200
Angel, are you there?

41
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,950
Dear,

42
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,290
let's study together on Monday.

43
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,040
Baby,

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,300
I'll wait for you in the library on Tuesday.

45
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,649
Dear,

46
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,709
on Wednesday,

47
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,200
lets meet at the English corner on the field.

48
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,140
Let's study hard and make progress everyday!

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,710
A special concoction full of nutrients.

50
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,600
It's done!

51
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,060
Not there.

52
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,860
Then, can I come find you in the heavens?

53
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,960
I am swimming down to the mortal realm soon.

54
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,420
Do you know,

55
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,640
I have been practicing swimming lately.

56
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,420
Because, I want to

57
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,910
swim with you.

58
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,150
A handsome guy like you who tries so hard,

59
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,660
must have a lot of admirers.

60
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,510
I don't, girlie.

61
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,920
I only have you.

62
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,370
Smooth-tongued, I would never fall for your lies.

63
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,230
But,

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,090
I have fallen for you girl.

65
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,220
What do I do now?

66
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,560
Let's see who is this little puppy,

67
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,409
who refuses to leave me alone.

68
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,550
I just bought this phone!

69
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,310
Ren Ke-ying, you brat.

70
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,740
Don't you know how to open the door properly?

71
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,880
I was standing outside for five minutes,

72
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,010
and you didn't open the door for me.

73
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,810
I am giving you a chance to say it again.

74
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,140
As I was saying,

75
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,040
this goddamned door!

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,020
How can you not open automatically when you see my sister?

77
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,710
Take it down!

78
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,550
Good job taking it down!

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,790
I think you are busy trying to pick up girls.

80
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,550
How many girls have you flirted with today?

81
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,290
I am on a video call.

82

My brother is a playboy!

83
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,780
Girl, you better be careful!

84
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,050
Men are all trash!

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,610
Scum!

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,060
Bah!

87
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,070
What have I done

88
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,640
to deserve this?

Ren Ke-ying's brother?

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,770

95
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,590
How are the Student Council elections coming along?

96
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,650
Other than Tang Jia-jia and the two vice-presidents,

97
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,990
there are only a few candidates.

98
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,220
It seems there won't be much suspense about the outcome of this election.

99
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,020
But,

100
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,150
if Xia Bai

101
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,480

My dear Jia-jia, don't act so estranged.

105
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,920
We were just passing by

106
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,020
and heard your beautiful playing.

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,120
We couldn't help but

108
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,250
be drawn here.

So?

120
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,520
The elections this year are a bit special.

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,170
A celebrity is running for the position.

122
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,730
That's right. That genki girl Ren Ke-ying.

123
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,070
Besides her status as a celebrity,

124

her talent

125
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,050
is not any less than yours.

When the time comes,

127
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,850
I am worried that she will steal your thunder,

128
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,910
especially since you are currently the It Girl on campus.

129
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,410
So what if she steals my thunder?

130

Of course you don't have to care about this.

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,660
Tang Jia-jia is just one person.

174
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:17,830
I refuse to let her

175
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,330
ruin my mood.

176
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,220
Do you guys have training again tonight?

177
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,470
I want to go too.

178
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,330
Mhm.

179
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,410
Men are all trash!

180
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,640
Maybe he didn't do it on purpose?

181
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,400
Maybe he just really likes me.

182
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,920
[Likes me]

183
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,780
That's right.

184
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,410
Given the circumstances,

185
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,390
he must have only did what he did because he really likes me.

186
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,700
He just couldn't articulate his feelings.

187
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,560
That's why he confessed to me in that way.

188
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,980
But, even if that is the case,

189
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,230
I definitely cannot forgive him.

190
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,780
That was my first kiss, which I have cherished for 18 years.

191
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,620
[First kiss cherished for 18 years]

192
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,050
That's not right.

193
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,750
You lost your first kiss a long time ago.

194
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,780
When you were eight years old,

195
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,950
you gave your first kiss to your stuffed animal.

196
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,980
When you were ten years old,

197
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,080
you fell while riding a bike and kissed the ground.

198
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,050
You kissed a hamster when you were twelve.

199
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,350
It ended up biting you,

200
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,330
and you received a rabies shot because of this.

201
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,250
So,

202
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,150
that was not your first kiss.

203
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,910
Go away.

204
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,240
Bastard.

205
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,580
How can you act so matter-of-factly after stealing someone's first kiss?

206
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,260
Our Xia Bai is the best.

207
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,800
Ren Ke-ying. What are you doing?

208
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,750
It feels like an 8.0 magnitude earthquake from downstairs.

209
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,000
You bastard!

210
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,120
You are clearly as stupid as a pig.

211
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,730
Can't you be more careful?

212
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,750
What does Ming-ming being stupid have to do with me? [Play on words]

213
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,190
What are you saying?

214
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,200
Is your brain broken?

215
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,060
If you don't start studying,

216
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,630
you will really become a pig

217
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,680
in the future.

218
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,420
Oh right.

219
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,280
I told you to go see the tutor.

220
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,170
Did you?

221
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,870
I went.

222
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,280
But as soon as I arrived at school,

223
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,940
I was swarmed by a group of reporters.

224
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,800
I also ran into a crazy guy.

225
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,660
They were trying to ambush and encircle you.

226
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,860
Whatever. It's not like you don't understand.

227
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,230
Aiyah.

228
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,780
I painstakingly found a tutor according to your demands.

229
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,710
He is both handsome and smart.

230
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,850
But you?

231
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,340
You don't even appreciate my efforts.

232
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,930
You don't deserve my painstaking efforts.

233
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,420
Sigh.

234
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,410
I am to blame for being too outstanding.

235
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,120
I stole all the good genes

236
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
from you.

237
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,420
That's why you turned out so stupid.

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,730
What goes around comes around.

239
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:45,730
Oh right.

240
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,390
How was the audition?

241
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,930
Even though you are not as smart as your brother,

242
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,230
auditions like that

243
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,360
are as easy as pie for you.

244
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,890
Don't even mention it.

245
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,280
That female executive from FBK

246
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,380
said that I lack life experience and cultural literacy.

247
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,550
She eliminated me.

248
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,040
It's okay.

249
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,340
Failure is the mother of success.

250
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,670
Keep trying next time.

251
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,400
Keep working hard.

252
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,970
Nevertheless,

253
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,820
I have thought it through.

254
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,030
I have decided to

255
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,260
study hard,

256
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,910
and run for Student Council president.

257
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,970
This guy must be daydreaming.

258
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,310
She thinks she can run for Student Council president

259
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,520
just because she is a Student Council officer.

260
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,130
In order to be come Student Council president,

261
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,040
one must be the best of the best among students

262
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,000
in all of the following areas:

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,210
moral character, intelligence, physical strength,

264
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,390
appreciation for beauty, and industriousness.

265
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,770
At the same time, one must have

266
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,580
exceptional leadership skills and competence.

267
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,960
In any of the above areas,

268
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,770
my sister is

269
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,330
utterly

270
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,740
and completely lacking.

271
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,260
She has no chance.

272
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,540
Who speaks ill of their own sister to others?

273
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,300
That Mrs. Huang Pu said that

274
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,610
becoming Student Council president is complicated

275
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,570
I refuse to believe her.

276
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,620
I am going to run no matter what others say.

277
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,910
I will prove to her that

278
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,240
idols are more than their looks.

279
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,260
Then do you know why

280
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,970
Spark University has never had a Student Council president before?

281
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,430
That is because

282
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,740
the two vice-presidents

283
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,790
are overly competent.

284
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,360
They are in a stalemate because

285
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,100
neither can outcompete the other.

286
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,230
So,

287
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,440
it has become

288
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,060
an unspoken agreement

289
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,070
within Spark University Student Council.

290
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,820
The position of president will remain empty.

291
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,270
What do you mean?

292
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,210
Unless,

293
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,330
you gain the approval

294
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,660
of both vice-presidents simultaneously,

295
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,270
in addition to

296
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,640
winning the most votes

297
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,570
in the elections.

298
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,270
Then you will have a chance.

299
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,850
Never mind, forget it.

300
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,490
The two vice-presidents compete against each other,

301
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,110
but their relationship is not one of conflict.

302
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,360
They even admire each other because they are so alike.

303
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,430
But that is between the two of them.

304
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,970
They don't interact much

305
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,710
in their daily lives.

306
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,940
They only know of each other's legendary existence.

307
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,250
Keep on daydreaming.

308
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,870
I still have a chance, right?

309
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,600
Keep up with the rhythm.

310
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,340
Tuo-hai, solo.

311
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,940
A-feng.

312
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,840
If you had come any later,

313
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,140
I would be tortured to death by Captain.

314
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,180
Sorry.

315
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,110
I am late.

316
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,240
Why is it still... Clearly we are being tortured to death by you.

317
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,140
What's up?

318
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,790
Is something the matter?

319
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,240
I heard from A-feng that you guys are training.

320
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,780
You've worked hard.

321
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,800
I brought you some water.

322
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,710
Wow.

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,050
Why do we have to get it ourselves,

324
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,190
but Captain

325
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,880
gets his personally handed to him by you.

326
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,420
I'll pass.

327
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,800
We should make the most of our training time.

328
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,050
The earlier we are done, the earlier we can rest.

329
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,580
Come on, let's continue.

330
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,410
You guys continue.

331
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,870
I'll watch from here. Three.

332
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,390
Two.

333
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,560
One.

334
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,790
Mind the rhythm.

335
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,840
Come on.

336
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,430
Hey, look.

337
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,690
Isn't that genki girl Ren Ke-ying?

338
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,340
I think it is her.

339
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,630
Wow, she is so pretty.

340
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,130
Look. She is indeed very pretty.

341
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,860
She is smiling at us.

342
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,400
She is smiling.

343
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,890
My god.

344
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,590
The campus has completely changed

345
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,170
after I have been gone for a semester.

346
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,910
Who can tell me where the classroom is?

347
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,420
Will I be late on my first day of class?

348
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,470
No no, this won't do.

349
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,530
Asking for directions is too embarrassing.

350
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,590
Damn.

351
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,970
Why did I wear high heels today?

352
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,990
My feet must be swollen.

353
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,960
Xia Bai.

354
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,980
It's Xia Bai.

355
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,110
He is hugging me again.

356
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,250
This must be an encounter written in the fates.

357
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,740
What a coincidence.

358
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,910
Are you okay?

359
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,890
Yes, what a coincidence.

360
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,740
I am okay.

361
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,490
[Get a hold of yourself]

362
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,490
Get a hold of yourself, Ren Ke-ying.

363
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,590
Maintain your image.

364
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,160
Take a deep breath.

365
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,410
Keep smiling.

366
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,910
But,

367
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,320
your high-heels are broken.

368
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,490
Are you really okay?

369
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,250
It's not a problem.

370
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,500
This is a new trend.

371
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,640
You know that as a celebrity,

372
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,740
we must always

373
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,880
lead the way in fa-shion.

374
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,530
Fa-shion?

375
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,190
You mean fashion?

376
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,090
Is your ankle sprained?

377
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,550
I am completely okay.

378
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,190
I have to get to class.

379
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,150
Bye for now.

380
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,700
Ren Ke-ying, are you crazy?

381
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,930
These Manolo Blahniks cost over 8000 RMB.

382
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,460
They are broken, just like that.

383
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,960
How embarrassing.

384
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,560
And fa-shion!

385
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,070
This won't do.

386
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,200
You will sprain your ankle like that.

387
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,610
If you don't mind,

388
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,300
just wear my shoes.

389
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,510
Then, what will you wear?

390
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,240
These are training shoes.

391
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,200
Put them on.

392
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,830
Are you going to class?

393
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,560
Which classroom are you going to?

394
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,180
I am going to

395
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,560
Tier T2 classroom.

396
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,730
Bye-bye.

397
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,840
Tier T2 Classroom is that way.

398
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,070
That way?

399
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,840
I am also headed to class.

400
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,650
Let's go together.

401
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,660
Okay.

402
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,690
Today, let's talk about

403
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,780
Liu Yong.

404
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,770
Ah...this Liu Yong.

405
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,900
Every one knows that

406
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,530
he was apparently dashing in manner

407
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,070
and unencumbered by rules.

408
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,770
When he passed away,

409
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,460
all of the prostitutes in town

410
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,550
mourned for him.

411
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,650
Why?

412
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,110
Because...

413
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,400
This

414
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,490
Liu Yong

415
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,070
was a lyricist.

416
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,370
He wrote lyrics for them.

417
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,500
Did you see?

418
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,760
Xia Bai and that girl came in together.

419
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,660
Is she Xia Bai's girlfriend?

420
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,510
Stop whispering amongst yourselves.

421
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,760
She is dressed well, and wearing sunglasses.

422
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,490
Is she a celebrity? This Liu Yong

423
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,510
was born into an airstocratic family.

424
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,580
He started studying poetry from a young age.

425
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,440
His name has been passed down in history books.

426
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,540
Wearing sunglasses in class.

427
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,430
Are you ashamed

428
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,250
to show your face?

429
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,460
Feng Si-si.

430
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,980
Be quiet.

431
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,800
Students who are talking, be quiet.

432
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,230
Do you have no respect for me?

433
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,410
Teacher,

434
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,490
we respect you.

435
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,630
But someone else doesn't.

436
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,530
Ah?

437
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,340
Wearing sunglasses in class,

438
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,440
she really thinks she's a celebrity.

439
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,050
This student here,

440
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,720
it seems that you don't respect me or the classroom.

441
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,020
You are wearing sunglasses in class.

442
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,850
You, answer my question.

443
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,690
I am sorry, Teacher.

444
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,550
I was wearing sunglasses because

445
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,960
I don't want to cause unnecessary trouble.

446
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,950
It's genki girl Ren Ke-ying!

447
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,570
She is really at our school!

448
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,870
Could Xia Bai and genki girl really be dating?

449
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,800
Is it real?

450
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,850
Okay.

451
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,080
It seems that this student is very popular.

452
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,150
I don't want to make it hard for you,

453
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,700
you simply appreciate

454
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,600
the change of the author ' s mentality

455
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,480
in the sentence  "I’m alone in the hotel, passing a day as if it were a year.”

456
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,460
of the poem "Qishi

457
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,640
in the Late Autumn "

458
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,830
written by Liu Yong.

459
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,920
This sentence should be about Liu Yong

460
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,700
when he eats out alone,

461
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,980
and sighs that life is so good,

462
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
just like New Year’ s Day.

463
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,490
Too talented,

464
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,990
this is to eulogize the changes brought to us

465
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,050
by the socialist reform and opening up.

466
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,960
This sentence means that Liu Yong is very lonely

467
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,770
and too difficult to live,

468
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,700
so as to express his lonely mood.

469
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,680
Are you here to make trouble ？

470
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,350
I ' m just trying to lighten the mood.

471
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,890
This sentence should be told that

472
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,380
Liu Yong is very lonely,

473
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,200
feeling  every day suffering in the hotel,

474
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,690
so as to express his lonely state of mind.

475
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,190
That ' s right.

476
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,300
Ren Keying is very humorous.

477
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,630
You explained it very well.

478
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,840
Everyone applause.

479
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,040
I didn ' t know you could be a star

480
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,390
and still be so uneducated.

481
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,600
I ' m sorry.

482
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,970
It ' s because I fell behind in my studies

483
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,430
that I went back to school to continue my study.

484
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,080
Please give me more advice in the future.

485
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,710
Your explanation is very interesting.

486
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,320
Of course,

487
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,420
the character “ gu ” means oneself,

488
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,550
the character “ guan ” means the restaurant,

489
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,310
so the phrase “ gu guan ”

490
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,770
means a person eating out alone.

491
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,090
I agree.

492
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,310
Shush!

493
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,270
Alright,

494
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,090
class is over.

495
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,510
Go.

496
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,090
I ' m so hungry.

497
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,230
Even my belly began to howl.

498
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,770
Go go go.

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,650
Get your stuff.

500
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,630
Aren't you have an event in the arts department.

501
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,110
Well,

502
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,520
I ' m gonna go.

503
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:10,900
OK.

504
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,330
I owe it to you today,

505
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,030
otherwise I would have made a fool of myself.

506
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,080
Never mind.

507
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,050
Just lift a finger.

508
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,870
And you don ' t have to be so polite,

509
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,680
after all, you helped us last time.

510
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,940
He winked at me.

511
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,480
He didn ' t release his charm, did he?

512
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,430
Up close, Xia Bai is indeed more handsome.

513
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,900
Are you sure?

514
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,470
Yes,

515
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,690
last time we were in front of FBK company,

516
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,780
the reporter gave us a whole page of report

517
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,760
because of your appearance,

518
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,110
which was a free publicity.

519
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,580
Don ' t worry about returning the shoes.

520
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,790
Be careful

521
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,530
next time you wear high heels.

522
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,120
Ok.

523
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,650
I ' m going to go.

524
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,410
Wait a minute.

525
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,430
Is there anything else?

526
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,060
Can I take you out for a treat

527
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,270
to show my gratitude?

528
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,410
Well, don ' t get me wrong.

529
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,940
I didn ' t mean anything,

530
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,000
but I thought it was polite

531
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,250
to say thank you.

532
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,460
Ren Keying, what are you doing?

533
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,360
What if he says no?

534
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,620
It ' s embarrassing in public.

535
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,090
Never mind. It ' s okay not to go.

536
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,900
OK.

537
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,330
Did you just say,

538
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,910
okay?

539
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,640
Yeah.

540
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,260
I happen to be a little hungry.

541
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,560
I can ' t say no to a big star, can I?

542
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,420
Let ' s go.

543
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,630
Ok.

544
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,230
I ' m sorry,

545
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,560
because of me,

546
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,990
we had to go to this little diner.

547
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,130
It doesn ' t matter,

548
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,500
a lot of delicious food

549
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,680
is often hidden in this humble shop,

550
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,670
like the gold hidden in the sand,

551
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,250
like the gold hidden in the sand,

552
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,420
We should be grateful

553
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,830
to find such a small shop.

554
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,170
Yeah,

555
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,240
the gold is gonna shine sooner or later,

556
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,000
just like you MAX boy band

557
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,390
successfully signed with FBK company.

558
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,720
How do you know so well?

559
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,830
I

560
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,600
couldn ' t help overhearing.

561
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,410
When you eat roast meat, you ' d better blow cool before eating,

562
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,730
otherwise it is easy to get burnt.

563
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,520
Actually,

564
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,540
it ' s not that easy

565
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,830
for gold to stand out from the sand.

566
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,810
We were on the verge

567
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,340
of losing it.

568
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,610
If it hadn ' t been for this opportunity,

569
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,380
MAX boy band

570
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,920
might have broken up.

571
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,610
No!

572
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,170
I mean,

573
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,130
how can you give up so easily

574
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,540
when you ' ve chosen to hold on to your dream.

575
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,450
That reporter is right,

576
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,750
we are an old group,

577
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,020
even if we have signed,

578
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,040
we may not be able to stand out,

579
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,070
in this era of fast consuming,

580
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,210
a group

581
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,030
can only fire for a few short years.

582
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,570
I

583
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,660
do think,

584
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,060
just because now is a fast consuming age,

585
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,740
we should not give up.

586
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,480
As long as stick to it,

587
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,260
sooner or later you can make a successful transition,

588
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,560
rather than be the fireworks,

589
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,650
only a temporary bloom.

590
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,980
Fireworks?

591
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,590
Yeah.

592
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,150
You ' re right,

593
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,990
even for my dream,

594
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,170
I can ' t give up easily.

595
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,150
Cheers!

596
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,480
Boss, I don ' t have any cash,

597
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,890
can I pay by mobile phone ？

598
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,830
I ' ll pay for it.

599
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,260
I ' m really sorry today.

600
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,720
We agreed that it would be my treat,

601
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,610
but you paid for it.

602
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,890
It is I who should thank you.

603
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,100
You let me know that

604
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,540
we are not without attention.

605
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,860
We will work harder,

606
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,910
and so will you.

607
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,930
Hope you give me more support and consideration in the future .
