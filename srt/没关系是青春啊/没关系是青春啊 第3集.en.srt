My brother is a playboy.

00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,350
Miss, you need to be careful.

What?

Things were easily

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,090
That was the first kiss that I have treasured for 18 years.

No. No.

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,720
Your first kiss has already gone.

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,570
It was Xia Bai.

12
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,710
He hugged me again.

13
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,850

Hello, Ms. Mei?

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,520
Uh.

19
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,780
I felt well on the first day of school.

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,930
Don't worry, Ms. Mei.

21
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm a measured and tactful person.

22
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,780
You didn't see

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,079
how surprised my classmates were because of my appearance.

24
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,280
I didn't have any problem with my study.

25
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,870
But I had some trouble with the student union election.

26
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,200
I won't talk to you.

27

means my brother is going to tease girls?

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,340
I will go in if you don't talk.

32
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,700
Why don't you talk?

33

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I have bothered you.

Why are you here?

36
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,150
You were taking a shower in my house.

37
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,400
How can you ask me why I'm here?

38
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,070
Is this your home?

You are Ren Yi's sister.

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,320
Firstly,

53
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,740
I'm the tutor

54

who is allowed to lodge here.

55
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,840
Secondly,

56
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,460
I did not misbehave with you.

57
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,960
It couldn't be constituted the charge of indecent assault.

58

So,

you don't need to call the police.

60
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,850
Ren Yi will explain it to you clearly.

My sisiter.

69
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,400
I will explain to you.

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,950
I have told you last time that I have hired a tutor for you.

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,300
Does he accord with

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,200
the condition of good looking that you have told me?

73
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,150
You can hire a tutor.

74
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,240
But why is he?

75
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,100
We have a very good relationship.

76

And his study performance is excellent.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,780
But you couldn't let him live in our home.

78
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,040
Have you gotten my permission?

79
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,180
You need to know that

80
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,430
he has no place to live these days.

81
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,970
And you are both young people.

82

You can integrate into campus life quickly.

Moreover,

84

Don't thank me too much.

I will talk to you later.

90

Though Ren Yi has allowed you to live here,

95

I have never allowed.

96
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,400
Then?

97
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,910
And I even don't know your name.

98

If you live here,

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,580
it would be too hasty.

especially for a superstar like me,

103
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,620

You rolled your eyes, right?

Since you have decided to be my tutor,

you need to be responsible for me.

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,450
she is looked down on by others

176
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,780
because of her poor study.

177
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,250
You also can't bear to see your good friend become upset.

178
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,850
Am I right?

179
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,540
I can bear it.

180
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,240
Hey.

181
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,090
If this is your attitude,

182
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,860
let me count something.

183
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,440
Eight years ago...

184
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,610
Hey, eight years ago.

185
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,910
Don't look at me.

186
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,690
I will say something even you are looking at me.

187
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,660
Eight years ago, you and my sister...

188
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,390
It's enough.

189
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,040
Stop talking.

190
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,300
I will do that.

191
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,600
That's right.

192
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,690
After all,

193
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,390
I'm creating opportunities for you.

194
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,230
Am I right?

195
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,440
Would you like me to be your tutor?

196
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,530
Yes.

197
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,620
Well.

198
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,630
Let's get reacquainted.

199
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,200
My name is Lin Rijiu.

200
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,370
Nice to meet you.

201
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,150
My name is Ren Keying.

202
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm a star.

203
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,100
What are you doing?

204
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,800
No. It's my room.

205
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,580
To test your academic level,

206
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,150
you need to take some small tests first.

207
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,450
I'm a star.

208
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,870
I need to save my face.

209
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,620
Hey.

210
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,810
Who has allowed you to go into other's rooms to look around?

211
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,060
My Bai...

212
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,160
Don't look at this. Don't look at this.

213
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,260
So, does a star also go after other stars?

214
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,400
Excuse me, is Teacher Gao Ge here?

215
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,020
Hello. It's me.

216
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,080
Who are you?

217
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,210
Hello.

218
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,780
I'm the agent of Ren Keying.

219
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,120
They all call me Ms. Mei.

220
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,980
Sit down. Sit down.

221
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,910
Sit down.

222
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,090
Have some water.

223
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,480
Don't bother. Don't bother.

224
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,450
I came here this time

225
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,780
to ask for your help.

226
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,040
Please say. What can I do for you?

227
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,850
Just say.

228
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,870
Here's the thing.

229
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,450
I think you have known that

230
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,430
Keying is going to go back to school to continue her study.

231
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,690
If Ren Keying really goes back to school,

232
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,750
the school also has

233
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,290
some our own rules and regulations.

234
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,290
For example, some unnecessary performance...

235
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,030
Please be assured. We have our own arrangements.

236
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,010
Teacher Gao.

237
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,230
I know you are a responsible counselor.

238
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,570
But that's not enough.

239
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,170
You also know that

240
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,270
Keying is on the rise in her career.

241
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,250
She needs to get the opportunity of the heroine

242
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,560
of The President Can't Be in a Relationship invested by FBK Company.

243
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,970
So,

244
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,600
I hope that no matter you are a teacher

245
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,500
or you are her fan, you can help her.

246
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,680
You mean that...

247
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,390
Help her to be the chairman of the student union.

248
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,290
I'm afraid that...

249
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,340
Of course.

250
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,110
We won't

251
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,140
let Teacher Gao do this for free.

252
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,500
Otherwise, we will be impolite.

253
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,290
This is a little token of our regard.

254
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,460
Please accept it.

255
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,190
Ms. Mei, I think that

256
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,810
you may have misunderstood me.

257
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,350
Yes.

258
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,930
I'm a teacher.

259
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,390
My income may be

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,650
more than ten times,

261
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,790
dozens of times, or even hundreds of times lower than yours.

262
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,530
But I'm enough to feed myself.

263
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,090
I don't want to bring those dirty deals

264
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,420
and scandalous acts of society

265
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,830
to the pure campus.

266
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,220
I didn't mean that, Teacher Gao.

267
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,560
I will try my best to help Yingying.

268
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,540
I will help her to study better and grow up.

269
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,440
But I will never give her too much convenience

270
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,730
or offer advantages to her

271
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,800
because I know it will make me be irresponsible for her.

272
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,460
For her life experience,

273
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,750
it will be a huge stain.

274
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,610
So, I hope you

275
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,590
do not humiliate

276
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,130
the rules and principles a teacher sticks to at will.

277
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,530
I think that

278
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,470
you must go back with no results today.

279
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,820
Please leave.

280
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,010
Teacher Gao.

281
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,040
I feel sorry for my presumptuous behavior today.

282
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,360
I know you are a good teacher.

283
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,130
I believe that Keying can

284
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,510
learn a lot of knowledge from you.

285
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,230
Of course.

286
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,130
I think that

287
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,030
I'm sure to help her to grow up well.

288
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,500
[Tweeting.]

289
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,260
[My dear fans of Ying.]

290
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,000
[Your goddess]

291
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,820
[is studying hard now.]

292
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,600
It's "Guan Guan Ju JIu".

293
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,860
You spelled it as "Zhui Jiu"

294
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,190
and explained the word as catching up desperately.

295
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,120
Yes.

296
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,540
You explained "the pretty lady"

297
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,640
as "the girl who has a slim waist".

298
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,500
So, do all men like thin women?

299
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,590
Yes.

300
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,270
Has your language been taught by a PE teacher?

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,250
What you wrote was too bad.

302
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,780
A donkey's lips can not fit into a horse's mouth.

303
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,240
I know this saying.

304
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,570
A donkey's lips can not fit into a horse's mouth.

305
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,670
It means that a donkey can not kiss a horse.

306
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,860
Is my explanation not right?

307
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,840
That's how I have always understood it.

308
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,020
Your Modern Chinese History is 15 points.

309
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,400
Your Basic Culture Course is 25 points.

310
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,570
Your English is 18 points.

311
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,380
Your Math is

312
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,710
zero.

313
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,700
The total score even can't reach the Pass grade.

314
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,370
How exactly did you get into this college?

315
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,710
Ah, I...

316
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,410
I'm usually too busy.

317
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,620
You see. I needed to

318
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,400
take many kinds of ads

319
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,690
and short videos.

320
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,060
I also had many commercial performances.

321
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,870
And...

322
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,890
I didn't have enough time to study.

323
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,520
That was why I needed you to help me study.

324
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,070
This is the ad I took two days ago.

325
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,620
From now on, you must cut out all non-study-related activities.

326
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,610
I will give you special one-on-one training.

327
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,190
It's impossible.

328
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,890
I need to finish my work and have classes.

329
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,150
I also need to strive for the chairman of the student union.

330
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,770
How can I have

331
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,940
the special one-on-one training with you?

332
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,670
You...

333
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,040
want to be the chairman of the student union?

334
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,250
Uh.

335
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,180
Yes.

336
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,960
The reason why I came back to school

337
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,580
is not only to study hard

338
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,560
to let others know I'm not an illiterate person

339
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,990
but also to show the president of FBK Company

340
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,610
that idols are not vases.

341
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,980
I, Ren Keying, can also be

342
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,800
the chairman of the student union with good character and academic performance.

343
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,700
Since then,

344
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,070
I should think about

345
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,050
how to make your further transformation.

346
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,310
Let's start with

347
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,640
the complete change of identity.

348
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,300
You are no longer a star.

349
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,040
You don't need to cope with any work.

350
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,730
You have only one identity now.

351
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,790
You are a student.

352
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,680
Are you kidding?

353
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,660
Even if I don't want to be a star,

354
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,290
there will still be countless news surrounding me.

355
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,440
Some work can't be finished without me.

356
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,050
You see. My agent is calling me again.

357
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,000
Hello, Ms. Mei.

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,810
Are there any new working plans?

359
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,620
Keying.

360
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,970
Our company has known the appointment between you and the FBK Company.

361
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,580
Since you have heavy academic workloads,

362
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,250
we will not arrange any activities and performances for you temporarily.

363
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,040
We hope you can study attentively and achieve your goals as soon as possible.

364
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,520
But...

365
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,340
Well. Don't ask me.

366
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,670
It's settled.

367
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,760
Keying, you have to work hard.

368
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,099
-I'm busy. I will hang up the phone.
-I...

369
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,319
[The Test Paper of Undergraduate Courses of Spark University]

370
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,240
Answer these papers again.

371
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,359
Ah?

372
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,480
Who can help me?

373
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,170
That's all for today.

374
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,260
Whose shoes are these?

375
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,240
They are my Bai's.

376
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,250
You don't know him.

377
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,350
He is the man on the posters in my room.

378
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,200
He is Xia Bai,

379
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,460
an excellent boy who is 100 times more handsome than you.

380
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,950
Why are you standing still?

381
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,250
Do you like watching others washing their shoes?

382
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,140
I want to go to the bathroom.

383
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,440
Blunt.

384
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,770
Not sharp.

385
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,100
Blunt.

386
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,990
It's an adjective.

387
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,780
Its opposite is sharp.

388
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,550
Yo.

389
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,250
Isn't this our superstar?

390
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,870
I am wondering what you are memorizing.

391
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,490
So you want to pass CET-4?

392
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,060
Yeah.

393
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm so busy with work.

394
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,930
But it's really important to learn English well.

395
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,290
Blunt. Not sharp.

396
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,270
It's an adjective. Its opposite is...

397
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,860
She describe you with blunt.

398
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,270
I can understand it.

399
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,040
Blunt.

400
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,990
Thank you.

401
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,600
You're blunt. You're blunt.

402
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,520
I'm plump. Plump. Plump. Slightly fat.

403
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,790
I do know it.

404
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,450
Plump. Plump. Slightly fat.

405
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,820
I've heard about your situation

406
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,750
from your agent.

407
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,570
I also know that your basic need

408
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,310
is to cram in school

409
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,330
and run for president of the student union.

410
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,340
Very good.

411
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,320
I've been reserving your position

412
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,770
as director of the student union.

413
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,470
You can have a try

414
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,600
at this re-election.

415
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,940
Really?

416
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,860
Thank you, sir.

417
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,460
Where were we?

419
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,590
That's it.

420
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,640
It's not realistic

421
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,730
to become president of the student union

422
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,070
instantly.

423
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,480
But you can start as director of the student union.

424
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,330
Step by step.

425
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,500
There is another selection

426
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,470
at the end of each semester.

427
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,840
You still have a chance.

428
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,530
Okay.

429
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,240
To help you fit in better with the student union,

430
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,370
today I have invited

431
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,140
two distinguished vice presidents of the student union.

432
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,680
But I have to...

433
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,530
Come in, please.

434
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm sure you've heard about

435
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,190
the two distinguished vice presidents of the student union

436
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,450
of our Spark University.

437
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,870
No matter from the learning ability

438
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,920
or working ability,

439
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,180
they can be called a first-class excellent.

440
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,500
You wanted to see us, sir?

441
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,740
You!

442
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,460
You guys

443
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,090
are the vice presidents of the student union of Spark University?

444
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,300
Hello.

445
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,190
We meet again.

446
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,900
It's so dramatic.

447
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,910
Are you kidding?

448
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,250
Aren't you afraid I'm gonna get you in trouble, screenwriter?

449
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,990
You've already known each other before?

450
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,890
Good. Great. Excellent.

451
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,570
I'll leave you guys

452
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,830
with time.

453
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,890
Don't forget about the upcoming election of the student union.

454
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,300
I'm going to attend a conference.

455
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,630
Call me

456
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
if you have anything.

457
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,740
Call me.

458
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,120
Ying.

459
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,730
Come on!

460
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,870
You're the best!

461
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,210
I'll always stand behind you.

462
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,860
Who can tell me

463
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,790
what is going on here?

464
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,450
That's what you see.

465
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,690
Are these the shoes you brushed

466
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,710
for the man hotter more than me yesterday?

467
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,890
Wow. They're so clean

468
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,860
and as good as new.

469
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,910
You really did a good job.

470
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,890
Of course it's clean.

471
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,310
-You didn't see how...
-Lin Rijiu!

472
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,960
Dear Lin.

473
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,020
President Lin.

474
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,040
Why you didn't tell me yesterday

475
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,060
that you are the vice president of Spark University

476
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,840
and you know Xiabai?

477
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,140
I was not in the mood.

478
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,030
I was gonna tell you.

479
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,090
But I forgot it after dinner.

480
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,360
You had dinner together?

481
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,290
Don't change the subject.

482
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,710
Because you're hiding the truth from me

483
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,050
and hurting my heart.

484
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,470
So

485
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,490
you have to support me

486
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,860
in the election of the student union.

487
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,950
That's impossible.

488
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,440
You!

489
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,170
He's probably sulking

490
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,470
because we didn't invite him to dinner.

491
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,640
I didn't know

492
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,770
you two knew each other before.

493
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,940
More than that.

494
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,400
He's living in my house.

495
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,950
Are you living together?

496
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,330
It's not what you image.

497
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,030
My brother called in him for my study.

498
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,920
It is what you image.

499
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,570
Shut up!

500
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,590
You have to support me

501
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,760
whether you want or not.

502
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,800
Idiot.

503
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,230
Don't worry.

504
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,170
I can help you on your studies if you could trust me.

505
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,390
I happen to live across the street from you.

506
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,870
You're willing to help me?

507
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,800
Yeah.

508
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,980
He's willing to help me.

509
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,730
Am I dreaming?

510
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,510
But my brother already has Lin Rijiu to help me.

511
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,300
Does he want to see me more often?

512
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,210
No!

513
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,830
No.

514
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,200
