[ Previously on It's okay. This is youth! ]

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,140
I have got those stamped documents

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,320
but if I don't have the works

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,150
I'll be screwed.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,170
You give us three excellent models

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,940
we will provide the works for you.

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,040
Though, many people cannot see your efforts

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,770
but

10
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,390
there are many people loving you

11
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,530
and protecting you

12
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,460
Xia Bai is right

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,180
for my younger sister

14
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,150
support and approval

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,080
are much more important

16
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,970
Hey

17
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,230

Episode 7

20
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,810
What?

21
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,840
Are you surprised by my wonderful ideas?

22
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,140
Keying

23
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,120
this is your confidence?

24
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,130
I think

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,560
we two decorate the venue

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,860
according to the style of last-year's.

27
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,490
I know you can't appreciate this beautiful thing

28
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,630
so I asked Alice

29
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,160
to transfer a copy for me

30
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,810
the theme of the exhibition will be showed

31
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,000
in three aspects, Midsummer's Night, Firefly and Forest

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,990
the whole style of the venue will be close to the nature

33
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,760
thereinto

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,579
the wallpaper is mainly based on the grass green

35
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,850
not using the traditional red carpet

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,990
I want to cover the whole ground

37
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,400
with the artificial turf

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,930
and

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,790
besides the common laser lights

40
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,810
I wanna use the imitation-firefly LED lights

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,000
to express the beautiful and fantasy atmosphere

42
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,110
and

43
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,330
I have convinced the art students

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,660
to provide the works about midsummer's night

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,770
and natural forest.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,650
Awesome.

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,350
I can promise

48
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,250
this will be the most fantastic exhibition

49
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,820
of Xing Huo University ever.

50
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,500

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,260
the rented containers have been delivered to the college

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,440
we only have 10 hours to set the venue.

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,450

55

Okay.

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,650
need two paintings. 
 Put it there.

Okay, byebye.

the exhibition may be held successfully

Underestimate her?

122

If she can make it

123
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,110
I lose.

I don't wanna let you down.

159

I won't let you down.

No

I don't wanna see you pretending to be strong

so

164
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,470
the rest of the things

165
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,010
I will handle it.

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,140
why are you here?

179
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,180
You boyfriend asked me to look after you.

180
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,320
What boyfriend.

181
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,330
Don't talk nonsense.

182
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,220
Wow

183
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,230
our Keying

184
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,440
knows to be shy.

185
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,180
You two live together

186
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,710
you tell me he's not your boyfriend?

187
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,020
And he heard you're not comfortable

188
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,360
he looked so caring about you.

189
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,750
The young people now

190
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,820
like to show off before the single people.

191
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,520
Right

192
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,460
the exhibition, what time is it?

193
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,590
It's eight o'clock.

194
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,440
The exhibition is going to start

195
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,960
I need to go there.

196
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,610
Don't worry

197
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,000
your boyfriend has arranged everything

198
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:07,930
And

199
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,220
our dynamic fairy

200
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,720
is going to wear this outfit

201
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,170
to attend the exhbition?

202
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,270
What should I do?

203
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,100
That outfit I wore has been wet through.

204
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,420
Our Keying has forgotten

205
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,830
who am I.

206
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,140

Keying

212
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,360
you're awake.

213
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,910
Keying's boyfriend

214
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,520
did you bring the things I want?

215
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,580
I

216
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm not Keying's boyfriend.

217
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,060
I bring your things.

218
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,470
Your cosmetics.

219
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:44,780
Right

220
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,790

221
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,560
Is he hosting the exhibition?

222
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,980
I forgot to tell you

223
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,580
he

224
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,470
has something

225
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,970
and can't come tonight

226
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,470
Mr. Gao and Tang Jiajia are hosting the exhibition.

227
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,340
I knew it.

228
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,040
He's not reliable at the critical moments.

229
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,820
Fine, it's okay he doesn't come.

230
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,960
OK, time is up

231
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,850
change it here.

232
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,240
Man goes out, don't look.

233
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,580
Keying's boyfriend!

234
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,120
Catch it!

235
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,970

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,030

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,730
Black gold abalone.

241
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,980
Did you know?

242
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,290
It just be fished from Australia

243
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,620
and sent by air at the same time.

244
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,260
Butler Jin said you got food poisoning

245
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,390
and stay in hospital.

246
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,020
Mom didn't spend your birthday with you

247
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,450
today I'm available

248
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,190
so I bought some food for you.

249
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,980
I'm full.

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,780
You're full now?

251
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,050
You want some desert or fruit?

252
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,550
What about macarons?

253
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,480
It's okay mom.

254
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,540
Good to see you're okay.

255
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,750
If there is nothing else

256
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,440
I should go.

257
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,440
Tonight

258
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,620
you're not going to stay at home?

259
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,100
Have an early rest.

260
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,310
You.

261
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,590

I blow your exhibition.

308
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,730
Why is the power out?

309
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,520
I can see nothing.

310
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,400
The power is out.

311
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,100
Why is the power out?

312
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,320
What's wrong?

313
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,510
Don't panic.

314
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,700
You stepped on my toes!

315
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,030
I'm sorry for that.

316
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

317
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,880
I told you it's bad to attend the exhibition at night.

318
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,220
Mr. Gao

319
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,000
please check the power supply facilities.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,440
Okay.

321
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,420
Right

322
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,310
don't panic

323
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,690
this is actually a surprise of the exhibition

324
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,000
if it scared you

325
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,930
hope  that you can understand.

326
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,700
Surprise?

327
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,040
I think it's scare.

328
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,440
Right.

329
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,170
Wow

330
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,340
see!

331
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,290
It's pretty!

332
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,360
Like the starry sky of the Midsummer's Night

333
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,130
pretty good.

334
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,810
It's so beautiful

335
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,420
looks fancy suddenly.

336
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
Right

337
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,450
the power is out

338
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,750
how did you make it?

339
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,960
I bought the storage battery

340
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,820
I was afraid of the blackout

341
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,160
it's not over

342
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,750
it's the Firefly Forest of Midsummer's Night

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,580
the firefly is a must.

344
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,180
Wow

345
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,200

346
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,860

347
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,400
What a surprise!

348
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,190
How to do that?

349
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,680
It's pretty.

350
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,850
It's so good.

351
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,900
It's so beautiful.

352
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,110
May I

353
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,180
dance with you?

354
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,470
Of course.

355
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,090
Why is her

356
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,760
not me?

357
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,310
Hey

358
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,380
young miss

359
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,760
drink yourself?

360
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,420
Fuck off.

361
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,790
Cranky

362
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,000
I like it.

363
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,080
Young miss, tell me about your sad things

364
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,520
we can have a chat.

365
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,170
You dare to splash me?!

366
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,310
Stay away from my friend.

367
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,510
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

368
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,850
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

369
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,150
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,660
We should go

372
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,300
call me.

373
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,260
Don't drink more.

374
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,090
Leave me alone.

375
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,100
Okay

376
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,840
I drink with you.

377
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,360
You lose your mind?

378
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,610
You can't drink.

379
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,850
I don't lose my mind

380
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,020
it's you

381
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,960
see what you're like now

382
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,800
where is that bright and optimistic Feng Sisi？

383
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,040
Bright

384
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,460
optimistic

385
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,600
I just know Xia Bai likes her but not me

386
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,470
I can't bear it

387
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,360
you know?

388
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,670
Why didn't you tell Xia Bai?

389
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,500
You are the one found the show for him

390
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,830
in the scorching sun

391
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,340
you found the practicing room for him

392
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,590
you have done so many things

393
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,000
why didn't you tell him?

394
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,220
Shut up.

395
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,120
Right

396
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,360
Xia Bai and I

397
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,860
grew up together

398
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,350
he hid all the pains

399
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,490
in his heart

400
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,310
never talk to anyone

401
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,310
he give all the warmth

402
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,100
to the people around him

403
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,340
I know

404
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,660
if I told him

405
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,130
he would be with me

406
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,240
but I

407
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,480
but I don't wanna use the gratitude

408
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,060
use the gratitude

409
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,230
and self-accusation

410
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,900
to threaten him to be with me

411
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,290
what I want the most

412
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,560
is to see him happy

413
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,270
but why

414
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,630
I saw the fairy princess standing beside him

415
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,620
is Ren Keying

416
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,520
not me

417
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,710
my heart

418
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,140
is really broken.

419
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,470
Xia Bai?

420
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,520
Xia Bai, tell me why please

421
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,620
You tell me what's wrong with me, I can change.

422
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,060
Thanks to you,

423
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,670
today's exhibition is really fantastic.

424
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,640
Xia Bai.

425
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,790
It's mainly your contribution.

426
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,290
I just thought of the idea of fireflies.

427
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,020
OK.

428
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,000
The doctor said you should drink some ginger tea with brown sugar.

429
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,970
I'm going to make the tea.

430
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,060
You take a rest.

431
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,030
Thank you for your hard work today.

432
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,040
OK.

433
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,580
You also like Keying.

434
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,410
Are you kidding me?

435
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:12,820
I.

436
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,000
Yes.

437
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,210
I also like her.

438
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,820
So do you,

439
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,910
don't you?

440
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,070
She

441
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,370
has fantastic magic.

442
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,320
Though

443
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,340
she is always careless

444
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,040
about doing everything,

445
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,470
she even

446
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,690
often makes a mess sometimes.

447
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,160
But in fact,

448
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,220
she really works hard,

449
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,280
and she is also so strong.

450
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,450
She always brings other people hope and happiness,

451
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,360
but she keeps grievances and sufferings

452
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,690
to herself.

453
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,160
I also want to protect her

454
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,380
and support her.

455
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,330
Thus,

456
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,430
even if we are good brothers,

457
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,380
I also will not give up on her.

458
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,450
Don't you give up on her?

459
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,340
Can I

460
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,000
also do this?

461
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,100
There are often different situations

462
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,930
in your life,

463
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,610
only if you take a step forward

464
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,140
and hold it close at hand.

465
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,770
However,

466
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,380
there are too many lonely people in the world

467
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,850
who are afraid to take the first step.

468
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,750
They don't know...

469
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:04,080
♫ I haven't heard your news for a long time. ♫

470
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,930
whether there is an alienating abyss

471
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,880
after they take that step.

472
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:11,030
♫ How long will I adapt to such an ending? ♫

473
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,110
♫ It's also good to be alone without arguments. ♫

474
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:25,730
♫ I sit quietly in the room and hide in the corner. ♫

♫ Who is holding your hand ♫

490

Why...

492
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,390
♫ and holding your finger now? ♫

493
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,140
Why do you...?

494
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,940
You tell me that, and I can correct it.

495
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:19,740
♫ I hope you can understand that it's not because I don't ask you to stay. ♫

497
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,730
Which type of person do you like? Xia Bai.

498
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:27,060
♫ I clearly know that we will not have an ending. ♫

499

I can correct it.

500
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,230
It's so late.

501
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,640
You still don't go back to take a rest.

502
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,700
There are so many things in the company recently.

503
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,110
How can I take a rest?

504
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,070
Many things need to make plans ahead.

505
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,640
Right.

506
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,310
How is Keying?

507
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,040
Keying

508
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,820
has grown up.

509
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,070
She did very well,

510
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,700
which exceeded my expectation.

511
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,800
I know Keying will not make me disappointed.

512
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:58,930
Right.

513
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,440
You don't tell Keying the company's bad news.

514
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,800
OK.

515
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,690
What's wrong with the leader?

516
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,820
He doesn't feel well.

517
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,780
Leader, you don't scare me.

518
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,760
You are most serious about regular exercises.

519
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,180
You have continuously danced several eight beats wrongly.

520
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:35,860
I

521
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,570
might have a crush on Ren Keying.

522
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,690

But

524
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,020
don't be afraid to be alone.

525
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,640
Because even if you don't take a step forward,

526
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,340
the person who loves you is still willing to

527
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,219
take one more step to you.
