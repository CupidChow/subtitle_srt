1
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,848
The moment all puzzle pieces
fall into place,

2
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,309
reasonable doubt subsides,

3
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,020
and substantial truth is revealed.

4
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,954
It's the beginning of judgment by the law
with scales and a sword.

5
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,753
Is the law truly righteous?

6
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:39,951
TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY BY THE LAW

7
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,665
OCTOBER 2020, PRESENT

8
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,126
Prosecution, continue your questioning.

9
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,296
-Witness.
-Yes.

10
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,215
Do you regret obtaining pentobarbital,
a euthanasia drug,

11
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,633
per the defendant's request?

12
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,551
I do.

13
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,053
I wouldn't have obtained it

14
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,600
if I knew he wanted to kill a person
instead of a terminally ill dog.

15
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,643
That's all.

16
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,730
Counsel, cross-examine.

17
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,734
YEONJU-DONG DRUG POISONING MURDER CASE

18
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,326
Witness,
you're the defendant's university friend,

19
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,911
who's running an animal clinic.

20
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,663
We're alumni, but he changed his major--

21
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,081
Please answer yes or no.

22
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,001
Yes.

23
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,713
The defendant changed his major
and is in Dental School.

24
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,467
Can't he easily get his hands on drugs
such as ketamine or propofol?

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,136
Objection. It's a leading question.

26
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,889
Didn't you know
it's allowed in cross-examination?

27
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,025
Please answer yes or no.

28
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,485
He can obtain it, can't he?

29
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,821
Yes.

30
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,657
If he was going to kill a person,

31
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,493
why would he have asked the witness,
who's a veterinarian,

32
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,203
to obtain the euthanasia drug?

33
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,621
-I think--
-That's unnecessary

34
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,123
from a man
who was jealous of the defendant.

35
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,709
-Objection!
-The witness cannot make an objection.

36
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,214
The defendant only wanted to euthanize
his terminally ill pet dog.

37
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,884
And the witness was well aware of that.

38
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,302
Objection.

39
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,554
The counsel is humiliating the witness.

40
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,056
-Sustain--
-I admit.

41
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,143
Stating the witness had a crush

42
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,187
and was jealous of the defendant

43
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,898
could lead to an impression
his testimony is false,

44
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,483
so I withdraw the statement.

45
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,027
-Objection.
-That's all.

46
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,579
YEONJU-DONG DRUG POISONING MURDER CASE

47
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,171
Let's take a 30-minute break.

48
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,312
YOUR DONATION WILL BRING JUSTICE

49
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,814
A MONUMENT
FOR ALUMNUS SEO BYUNG-JU'S DEDICATION

50
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,736
You shouldn't lead him on that much.

51
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,571
Do you know why the counsel is allowed

52
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,073
to lead the witness
during the cross-examination?

53
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,575
It's saying we can go all out.

54
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,245
To destroy the prosecutor's argument.

55
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,081
I shouldn't do that much? My ass.

56
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,126
Sorry.

57
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,587
I got summoned as a witness
for the prosecution,

58
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,630
but I only did her good.

59
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,385
I really hate you.

60
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,846
Not me, right?

61
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,599
What can I do?
I was only allowed to answer yes or no.

62
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,602
Should I have pleaded the Fifth?

63
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,936
The Fifth is there

64
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,815
for the defendant to use, not the witness.

65
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,984
What? Why were you there?

66
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,195
If the witness wants to refuse to testifyâ€¦

67
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,740
use the right to refuse to testify.

68
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,534
How dare a defendant jump on the bench.

69
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,246
It's not for a judge who's wearing pajamas
under the bench to say.

70
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,417
How dare you say that to the judge.
I'll punish you for insulting the--

71
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,752
Not insulting. Contempt.

72
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,172
-Criminal Code?
-Article 138?

73
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,383
Precisely.

74
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,384
Darn it.

75
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,721
Anyway, if we're told to answer
only yes or no, do we have to?

76
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,848
No, you don't have to.

77
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,309
What? I didn't have to answer yes or no?

78
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,435
I said yes for nothing.

79
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,520
Exactly.

80
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,117
The break is getting too long.

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,743
Did Professor Seo fall asleep?

82
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,871
Shouldn't we go find him?

83
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,832
Please do that, guard.

84
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,209
Yes, Your Honor.

85
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,712
YEONJU-DONG DRUG POISONING MURDER CASE

86
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,969
Professor Seo.

87
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,513
Professor Seo?

88
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,643
Professor Seo, the break is over.

89
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,358
Professor, are you asleep?

90
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,779
Professor?

91
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,256
YEONJU-DONG DRUG POISONING MURDER CASE

92
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,038
Hello.

93
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,753
We had no idea.

94
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,796
-We were all here.
-Everyone was here.

95
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,566
Prosecutor Yang.

96
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,090
KCSI

97
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,512
50 TEST STRIPS, 1 BOTTLE

98
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,668
GREEN TEA

99
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,549
I found this in the victim's inner pocket.

100
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,092
It must be suicide.

101
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,969
I'M SICK OF LIVING THIS LIFE

102
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,554
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

103
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,767
Someone who wanted to take his life today
won't need

104
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,685
those blood sugar test strips delivered.

105
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,689
Yes, you're right.

106
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,609
MR. SEO, 50 TEST STRIPS, 1 BOTTLE

107
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,082
He's a prosecutor I used to work with,

108
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,625
a professor at this law school.

109
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,252
Professor Yang Jong-hoon.

110
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,425
MARCH 2020

111
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,260
Yang Jong-hoon, the Criminal Code.

112
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,683
Case number 2017D4114.

113
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,436
Kim Cheol-su and Lee Yeong-hui made
a sex tape under consent in an affair.

114
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,854
When Lee wanted to leave,

115
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,023
Kim filmed the said video on his phone

116
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,442
then sent the recorded video
to Lee's husband.

117
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,569
The first and second trials
found him guilty,

118
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,405
but the Supreme Court acquitted him.

119
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,989
What's the key issue here?

120
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,876
The high bun.

121
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,098
I don't think anyone in here
has a high bun.

122
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,353
The main issue was Article 14
of the Act on Punishment of Sexual Crimes.

123
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,523
It punishes those who use cameras
to film other people's body

124
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,067
or distribute the photograph or video.

125
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,070
The key issue was if the word "body"
should be taken literally.

126
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,991
The first and second trials
pronounced him as guilty,

127
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,493
interpreting the image of a body
as a person's body.

128
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,203
But the Supreme Court disagreed

129
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,496
and found him innocent.

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,544
If you film someone's body directly,
you're guilty.

131
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,048
But it's not a crime
to take a photo of this.

132
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
-If you were the judge?
-I'm with the Supreme Court.

133
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,848
Criminal punishment
abides by principle of legality.

134
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,516
We must stay away from inference.

135
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,476
That's not right.

136
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,565
When we extend the interpretation
of a body to photos and videos of someone,

137
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,734
kissing this fellow student on the lips

138
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,153
would be considered the same
as kissing her photo.

139
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,613
That's not right.

140
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,949
So it wasn't a narrow interpretation?

141
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,244
When it comes to the misapplication
or people's emotional acceptance,

142
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,872
the law has been amended
to include a person's body

143
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,583
as well as the re-recording
of someone's photo

144
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,542
in the year 2018.

145
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,420
The law was the issue,
not the interpretation.

146
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,797
Legislation is the solution.

147
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,925
Second-round judicial exam?

148
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,677
Second-round judicial exam?

149
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,554
I heard one of the freshmen passed it.

150
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,348
That's amazing.

151
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,475
Yes, I'm Han Joon-hwi.

152
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,352
If you want me to remember you,

153
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,480
you better not take away
other students' chance to answer anymore.

154
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,819
Choi Mi-yeong, a drug offender, sued

155
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,695
Kim Min-su, the prosecutor, for rape.

156
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,698
After the investigation,
he wasn't indicted for rape but bribery

157
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,034
and the Supreme Court found him guilty.

158
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,538
The high bun from two minutes
and ten seconds ago, what's the issue?

159
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,707
Sorry? Right. It'sâ€¦

160
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,337
He was indicted for bribery
and not rape becauseâ€¦

161
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,135
-I tried to come prepared--
-The issue?

162
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,887
The issue is, wellâ€¦

163
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,264
So the issue is?

164
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,765
We don't know if he raped her.

165
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,809
We don't know, or was it not rape?

166
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,854
-Sorry? Right, it doesn't look like rape.
-Doesn't look like rape?

167
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,023
Will your decision say, "He seems guilty"?

168
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,526
You'd answer that if you came prepared.

169
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,113
It wasn't rape.

170
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,948
If it was bribery, what about Choi?

171
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,241
Choi Mi-yeong wasâ€¦

172
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,244
I'm not sure what you're asking.

173
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,287
Kang Sol B.

174
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,206
If it's a rape case,
Choi Mi-yeong would be a victim.

175
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,417
But if it's bribery,
she'd be accused, too.

176
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,004
Choi became a suspect
because sex was considered as a bribe.

177
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,046
And the key issue?

178
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,715
Is sex considered as a bribe?

179
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,216
Why did the court say yes?

180
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,719
-The essence of the bribe--
-Kang Sol A.

181
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,012
Me?

182
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,847
Well, it'sâ€¦

183
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,349
Since some people pay money
to have intercourse,

184
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,852
she bribed him with sex, not money--

185
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,021
So sex can be turned into monetary value,

186
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,106
acknowledging commercialization of sex?

187
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,108
-No, that's not what I meant.
-Then what?

188
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,152
It's not that
the court commercialized sex.

189
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,486
Then what?

190
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,198
-I'm sorry. My mind went blank--
-Kang Sol B.

191
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,326
The court considered
the benefit of bribery

192
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
not only as monetary or property gain

193
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,413
but anything tangible and intangible

194
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,082
that can satisfy
the demand and desire of a human.

195
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,543
It considered
sexual benefit through intercourse

196
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,878
as an intangible benefit.

197
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,962
Kang Sol A.

198
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,299
Why did the court acknowledge sex
as a bribe?

199
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,302
Kang Sol B just told you--

200
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,138
Kang Sol A,
I'm waiting to hear an answer from you!

201
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,935
Then what's bribery?

202
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,855
Bribery is
when civil servants receive money--

203
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,106
Only money?

204
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,318
And sexual acts.
Intangible benefit such as sexual acts--

205
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,569
And the elements are?

206
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,489
Relations to duty and--

207
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,289
Tell me now.

208
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,792
What's bribery?

209
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,297
-Professor.
-What is it?

210
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,801
Is there any kind of answer you can give?

211
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,718
I feel suffocated.

212
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,303
She might get a cardiac arrest.

213
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,975
What I can answer confidently isâ€¦

214
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,103
the circumstances precluding

215
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,354
-wrongfulness--
-The five.

216
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,438
JUSTIFICATION

217
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,732
Justifiable act, self-defense,

218
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,193
emergency evacuation, victim's consent,

219
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,820
and self-comfort.

220
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,364
"Self-comfort"?

221
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,325
When did it get into the Criminal Code?

222
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,202
Silence!

223
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,748
I'm sorry. It wasn't self-comfort.
I meant self-help.

224
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,542
-Then what's self-help?
-I don'tâ€¦

225
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,420
-I can't do it.
-You give up on the class?

226
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,839
No, sir.
I wish to take part in this class.

227
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,590
But answering this--

228
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,677
If you give up on answering this,
you give up on this lecture.

229
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,351
Self-help can be claimed
when the legal procedure

230
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,105
prevents you from preserving
your right to file a claimâ€¦

231
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,398
You can't even read?

232
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,026
to turn the right of claim infeasibleâ€¦

233
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,408
or to avoid difficulty
in carrying out theâ€¦

234
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,161
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,377
Let's take ten.

236
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,519
I thought you wanted an apology.

237
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,193
You said you wanted to learn from me.

238
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,362
Number 8003, Kang Sol.

239
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,116
Yes, I'm number 8003, Kang Sol.

240
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,785
Why did you come to law school?

241
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,911
To receive an apology.

242
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,038
An apology?

243
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,792
The law owes me a bit of,
no, a huge apology.

244
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,252
You want the law to apologize?

245
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,632
I got sued for assault
while trying to save someone.

246
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,175
It was very unfair.

247
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,095
I tried to get a lawyer
to claim self-defense,

248
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,679
but that cost three million won.

249
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,391
I tried to fight it alone,
but the fine was two million won.

250
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,644
I choked down my tears
and settled the case.

251
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,855
Because a million won of settlement
was my cheapest way out.

252
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,774
And that money

253
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,819
was my entire fortune that
I worked hard for and saved for years.

254
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,489
The law shouldn't have done this to me.

255
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,994
Becoming a lawyer was the only way
a poor kid like me could have justice.

256
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,163
And this special admission

257
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,707
was the only way
a poor kid could become a lawyer.

258
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,376
That's why I applied.

259
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,380
Okay. How do you expect
to have the law apologize to you?

260
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,384
That's for you to teach me, professor.

261
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,936
Will you still give up?

262
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,774
I didn't think it through. I'm sorry.

263
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,192
I don't want your apology.

264
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,945
Don't do anything to be sorry for.

265
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,365
We don't have much time left.

266
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,623
LECTURE HALL

267
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,126
Are you all right?

268
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,128
I deleted the photos--

269
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,338
Second-round judicial exam, save my life.

270
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,423
What?

271
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,892
Do you think Socrates knew

272
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,602
that in the future,

273
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,105
his teaching method would throw us
into this state of terror?

274
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,193
Han Joon-hwi and Kang Sol B
didn't look scared.

275
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,485
They seemed to enjoy this.

276
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,988
If Joon-hwi passed the second round,
why is he here?

277
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,948
No one gets dropped out at the interview.

278
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,241
Jealousy equals defeat,

279
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,119
but I'm jealous of LLB students
and judicial exam examinees.

280
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,705
You passed the first round,
and you went to med school.

281
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm a complete newbie. This is so wrong.

282
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,753
Newbies like us
have a totally different starting line.

283
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,504
How can we race with you?

284
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,007
But we all pee in our pants
during the Criminal Code.

285
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,508
I'm too scared to take a dump.

286
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,010
Hey, what are you doing?

287
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,847
You know, that girl. Kang Sol A?
I'm jealous of her resiliency.

288
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,307
How does she survive that?

289
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,185
"When did self-comfort
get into the Criminal Code?"

290
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,478
I'm about to puke.

291
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,479
"Answer me."

292
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,899
"You give up on answering,
you give up on this lecture."

293
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,572
-Again, I bet another student got scaredâ€¦
-Seo was indicted for bribery for the land

294
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,866
-at Yangcrates's class.
-he received from Ko.

295
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,034
He was found innocent

296
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,828
then declared that he'll donate

297
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,748
all 5.6 billion won he got
from selling that free property.

298
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,458
And that's today, correct?

299
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,294
Yes, according to Hankuk Universityâ€¦

300
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,506
-Seo Byung-ju always has a blow.
-Dean Oh Jeong-hui and Seo

301
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,299
went to visit the presidentâ€¦

302
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,801
-You okay?
-of their school

303
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,136
and said they'll have a donation ceremony.

304
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,348
You had to step down as a prosecutor
because of this free property.

305
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,641
If it were a bribe--

306
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,434
Instead, I got another goal.

307
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,604
Even if I don't make
any great judicial officers,

308
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,232
I'm not going to turn anyone
into a delinquent.

309
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,360
He wished the school would use this money
to support the students.

310
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,528
VICE DEAN KANG JU-MAN

311
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,822
Reporting with HBS, Choi Jun-hyeok.

312
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,535
Next story.

313
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,537
Child rapist Lee Man-ho, who made

314
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,622
Korea furious with his heinous crime,

315
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,333
fully served his sentence
and will be released today.

316
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,837
-He'll be put on an ankletâ€¦
-Man, he's released already?

317
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,339
-then be sent home after.
-That anklet isn't enough.

318
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,800
As his release date came closer,

319
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,094
-NGOs, the police, and reportersâ€¦
-Already?

320
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,430
all came together,
creating a lot of tension.

321
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,889
I'm doing an interview today.

322
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,641
Yes, this is Kim Eun-suk.

323
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,727
Yes.

324
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,107
VICE DEAN KANG JU-MAN

325
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,611
Ms. Oh wishes to have you here,
Professor Yang.

326
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,615
I'm sure you're busy
preparing for your class

327
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,035
with your Socratic method or whatnot.

328
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,328
I look forward to it.

329
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,165
Please create the best mock court
among all law schools in the world.

330
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,751
Yes, we'll build up a nice one and turn it

331
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,919
into the pride
of Hankuk University Law School.

332
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,714
Is Professor Yang coming?

333
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,927
He doesn't want to be bothered
in his break between classes.

334
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,221
But Mr. Seo wanted to see him.

335
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,848
Can he come for a moment?

336
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,100
Let me call him instead.

337
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,560
It's okay.

338
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,355
He conducted the investigation.

339
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,899
I'm sure it's too much for him to see me.

340
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,402
Then why did he say he wanted to see him?

341
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,156
Let's take a photo.

342
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,034
ATTORNEY SEO BYUNG-JU'S DONATION CEREMONY

343
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,372
That's 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000â€¦

344
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,706
I'm sure it's right.

345
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,584
5.6 BILLION WON

346
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,586
ATTORNEY SEO BYUNG-JU'S DONATION CEREMONY

347
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,921
One, two, three.

348
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,676
Lee Man-ho's atrocious crime

349
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,887
isn't just rape but an attempted murder.

350
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,182
He's a heinous criminal
as evil as a serial murderer.

351
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,560
He committed a crime
on a girl young enough to be his own

352
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,145
but didn't regret his acts.

353
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
Considering the long-term effects
the victim must live with,

354
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,151
I believe Lee Man-ho
should never be released.

355
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,743
CORRECTION

356
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,756
CODE OF LAW

357
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,674
There he is!

358
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,634
-There he is!
-There's Lee Man-ho!

359
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,177
-Step back!
-There he is!

360
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,888
There's a high chance
he will commit another crime.

361
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,890
The people will shake in fear

362
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,019
as they dread the release
of Lee Man-ho today.

363
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,440
BRIBERY OF CHIEF PROESECUTOR SEO

364
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,233
Case number 2017D2531.

365
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,568
A bribery case.

366
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,320
Chief Prosecutor Seo
was indicted for bribery

367
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,990
for receiving land worth 370 million
from Assemblyman Ko.

368
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,659
First trial, not guilty.
Second trial, guilty.

369
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,915
The Supreme Court sent the case back
and found him innocent,

370
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,750
and the case was finalized.

371
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,586
What's the issue here?

372
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,422
Should the free land Seo receivedâ€¦

373
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,717
be considered as a bribe

374
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,052
or a gift?

375
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,477
You're teaching my case during class.

376
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,354
What an honor.

377
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,028
The Supreme Court said it wasn't a bribe.

378
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,654
What's the reason?

379
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,992
Because the relations to my duty
and the quid pro quo wasn't proven.

380
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,121
Are you claiming the land that became
5.6 billion from 370 million won

381
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,332
was a gift, not a bribe?

382
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,502
It was a gift
that could be mistaken as a bribe.

383
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,503
KO, ASSEMBLYMAN

384
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,005
It was a gift I probablyâ€¦

385
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,507
SEO BYUNG-JU, CHIEF PROSECUTOR

386
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,091
shouldn't have taken.

387
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,093
A gift?

388
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,429
It was 370 million won.

389
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,681
A gift of such a high value isn't normal.

390
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,183
They were close friends.

391
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,268
"Close friends"?

392
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,983
As the written judgment stated,
Seo was a close friend to Ko,

393
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,402
so close that they knew
everything about each other.

394
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,113
If you knew everything about each other,

395
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,575
I'm sure you knew what Ko Hyeong-su wanted
when he gave you that land.

396
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,621
His ulterior motive of wanting your help
as the chief prosecutor

397
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,789
if he got in trouble.

398
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,128
If you accepted this land
knowing his ulterior motive,

399
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,923
we can't say it wasn't a quid pro quo
he gave as insurance.

400
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,092
It's a violation of the ban

401
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,176
on bribing officialsâ€¦

402
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,595
To carry out his or her duty
for personal gain.

403
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,809
So he bribed me as insurance?

404
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,644
You're right.

405
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,399
You didn't read the decision right.

406
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,027
You should've read it thoroughly
for my sake

407
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,612
since I left over this case.

408
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,408
Seo Ji-ho.

409
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,451
Will you tell us?

410
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,413
It looks like
you read the decision thoroughly.

411
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,709
An expectation of help in the future
isn't a quid pro quo.

412
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,753
Bribing someone as insurance
isn't considered bribery.

413
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,673
And the non-bribery
will be used for your benefit.

414
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,968
What a relief.

415
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,313
What an interesting class.

416
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,459
I heard you're called
the Yangcrates of Terror.

417
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,469
Professor Yang Jong-hoon
is pretty memorable.

418
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,473
But still, you belong in the prosecution.

419
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,017
Go back.

420
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,853
Yang Jong-hoon

421
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,230
is a born prosecutor.

422
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
I would've been so,

423
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,779
if only I didn't let Chief Prosecutor Seo
get the best of me.

424
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,534
Are you saying you're here now

425
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,079
because of me?

426
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,335
We'll say it's thanks to you.

427
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,022
RESTRICTED NUMBER

428
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
RESTRICTED NUMBER

429
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,199
If he really was murdered,

430
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,201
the culprit would've used that door.

431
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,413
So there are no CCTVs.

432
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,707
That's an entrance only for professors,

433
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,417
opened by fingerprint recognition.

434
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,378
So they walked through the court
and got there.

435
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,838
This screen is also missing

436
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,716
the hallway into the waiting room
from the court.

437
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,303
That means we cannot confirm
who came in and out of that room.

438
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,181
You'll get an idea
once you take the footprints.

439
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,231
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

440
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,233
Out of batteries?

441
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,985
I'll charge it now.

442
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,116
He's trying it out for his class.

443
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,747
If he was murdered,
do you have any suspects?

444
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:10,999
Me.

445
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,427
There is one more person
I'm suspicious of.

446
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,431
-Did it really happen?
-Say something!

447
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,515
Is it true?

448
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,058
-Wait!
-Over here!

449
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:29,976
Excuse me!

450
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,227
-Let me in!
-Stay back.

451
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,854
Was this really a murder case?

452
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,063
-Over here!
-Wait!

453
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,571
REPORTER JANG NAM-CHEOL

454
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,457
A murder case on our campus?

455
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,376
The donation was already controversial,

456
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,046
and this happened at the mock court
made with that money.

457
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,923
What did the police say?

458
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,384
They can't say he was murdered yet.

459
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm sorry.

460
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,766
They're waiting for the autopsy result
to see if he was murdered.

461
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,726
I hope it's not a murder case.

462
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,854
"Law School Murder Case"
is already trending online.

463
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,483
I doubt it's a suicide.

464
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,652
He has been after

465
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,279
the directorship of the Legal Clinic
until few days ago.

466
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,740
A video of the crime scene
went viral, too.

467
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:30,954
How did Hankuk University Law School
end up in this situation?

468
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,750
The school will not make any statements
regarding this case.

469
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,046
Please stay away from the media,
and tell your students to keep quiet.

470
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,510
To help them be less stressed or confused
and stay away from this case,

471
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,595
can we move up the midterm--

472
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,555
There's no need.

473
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,314
This meeting is stressful and confusing.

474
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,734
I'm sure the library is completely fine.

475
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,680
How can we go on
as if nothing had happened?

476
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,141
Didn't something awful
happen to Professor Seo?

477
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,076
-Come on.
-My gosh.

478
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,794
Former chief prosecutor Seo died

479
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,756
at Hankuk University,
he taught as an adjunct professor.

480
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,133
His body was reportedly foundâ€¦

481
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,134

How can we be fine
while people out there are in a ruckus?

486
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,187
Everyone just sits and studies.

487
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,522
What will you do if you don't study?

488
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,233
If you don't pass the Bar exam,
it'll ruin your life.

489
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,403
Only half of you will pass the exam.
This is war.

490
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,571
"You die, I live."

491
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,365
But it's not like he's a stranger.

492
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,533
He was there a second ago.

493
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,286
How can everyone be so cold?

494
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,289
Those psychopaths. Cold-blooded jerks.

495
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,502
You should be a psychopath
if that'll help you pass.

496
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,545
The police believe he could've been killed

497
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,630
and will do an autopsy

498
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,091
-to find the cause of death.
-Murder?

499
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,054
Forget it even if it's a serial murder,
not just a regular murder.

500
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,263
One more probation

501
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,809
and you'll have to pay them,
the poor people scholarship you got.

502
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,645
You have enough trouble.

503
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,439
And you work here part-time, too.

504
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,691
Go study.

505
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,901
But still, this is a murder case.

506
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,655
Go get murdered by your books.
Run along. Go. Go!

507
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,743
If he was murdered,
then who on earth is the culprit?

508
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,714
"You'll end up like me."
Hang it on your wall.

509
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,257
YOU'LL END UP LIKE ME

510
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,177
And fail the Bar exam ten times? No way!

511
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,248
EVEN YOUR SIGHS CAN BE LOUD!

512
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,384

You said he didn't kill himself.

00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,632
He had too many things to patch up
to kill himself.

00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,636
Former chief prosecutor Seo
died at Hankuk University

525
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,722
where he taught as an adjunct professor.

526
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,183
The police believe he could've been killed

527
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,561
and will do an autopsy
to find the cause of death.

528
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,814
We confirmed that Seo,
the former chief prosecutor,

529
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,817
was teaching a mock trial
at the time of his death.

530
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,113
Ironically, the new mock court
where Seo was found dead

531
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,618
was established with the donation
he made to the university,

532
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,203
making more people feel sorry.

533
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,790
Seo's body was first found
by one of the law school students.

534
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,251
The police will do an autopsy to findâ€¦

535
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,169
Is anyone home?

536
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,545
the cause of his death.

537
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,348
Mr. Lee Man-ho?

538
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,743
The people became highly interested
as Lee got released.

539
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,663
The top three percent
who are most likely to relapse

are kept under special control.

541
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,583
And Lee Man-ho is one of them, right?

542
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,211
Yes. Take a look at his location.

543
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,755
Look. Do you see that?

Where's the lecture hall
for the Civil Code class?

548
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,578
I'd like to thank all of you
who took your precious time out

549
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,249
to come and take this Civil Code class
I, Kim Eun-suk, teach.

550
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,962
I really dread the Civil Code.

551
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,216
I'm disgusted and appalled
by the Civil Code.

552
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,928
If anyone asks, "Will you read
the Civil Code or be pregnant?"

553
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,179
I'd rather get pregnant.

554
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,474
Then why do you--

555
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,476
Why do I teach the Civil Code, Min Bok-gi?

556
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,020

You're pretty.

571
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,061
I wanted to make sure you become students

572
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,605
who don't despise the Civil Code
as much as I did.

573
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,400
That means my class will be
more interesting than anything,

574
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,569
and you'll get so much out of it.

575
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,367
That Socratic method can go kill itself!

576
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,581
Then let us begin this fun class.

577
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,499
Now,

578
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,250
party A

579
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,546
sold a land worth 100 million won
to his close friend, party B.

580
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,928
I mean, if they're so close,
why couldn't he just give it as a gift?

581
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,764
Why did he take money
only to give us so much headache?

582
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,349
It's insane to give it away.

583
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,434
Yes, he's a nutcase.

584
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,853
My gosh. Goodness, sorry.

585
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,188
Forget I said "nutcase."

586
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,402
Now, party A received 95 million won
until the due date

587
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,695
and never got
the balance of 5 million won.

588
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,614
He claimed the contract is canceled,

589
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,742
and that he won't give back
the 95 million won he got.

590
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,369
He sounds more like a thief.

591
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,663
"He sounds more like a thief"?
Who said that?

592
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,084
I did.

593
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,004
-Sorry, I couldn't help it.
-It's the core issue.

594
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,216
Article Two, Trust and Good Faith, is made

595
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,301
so people's rights
must be exercised humanely

596
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,803
with trust and good faith,

597
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,513
within people's common sense.

598
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,015
It means we shouldn't be like a thief.

599
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,147
That just made so much sense!

600
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,774
Kang Sol A and Han Joon-hwi,

601
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,110
come hand-in-hand to my office
within this week.

602
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,948
I'll give you a chance to hit it off
while you clean every corner of my office.

603
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,162
Then let's discuss
this thief-like attitude a little more.

604
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,997
Do you think I'm like a thief, too?

605
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,148
Defendant, I'll give you one last chance.

606
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,526
While you committed

607
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,822
a heinous act of crime
against this young victim,

608
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:36,076
you received a phone call
from your young son.

609
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,163
I do not remember.

610
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,460
When your son asked what you were up to,

611
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,797
you should've stopped
your atrocious action then and there.

612
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,676
I was too drunk back then,

613
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,512
so I don't remember a thing.

614
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,429
Man.

615
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,390
This is driving me crazy.

616
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,018
It's the booze.

617
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,979
If it hadn't been for the booze.
Darn it, booze.

618
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,610
Well, I guess I regret that I got drunk.

619
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,570
You regret it, yet you lodged an appeal?

620
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,323
How can you laugh right now?

PROSECUTOR: SEO BYUNG-JU

624
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,004
The prosecution made no appeal.

625
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,675
It's deplorable that I cannot go above
the original sentencing.

626
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,843
As a judge, I am devastated

627
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,972
that I have no choice
but to reduce his sentencing

628
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,100
according to Article 10-2
of the Criminal Code.

629
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,438
Sentencing.

630
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,568
Article 10-2 of the Criminal Code.

631
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,028
"For the conduct of a person

632
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,657
who is unable to make discriminations
or to control one's will,

633
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,744
the punishment is mitigated."

634
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,498
This clause

635
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,586
will always torment my heart.

636
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,172
You asshole!

00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,389
Article 10-2 of the Criminal Code,
the Lee Man-ho Act.

638
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,978
Thanks to me, instead of forcefully
mitigating the punishment,

639
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,315
it was amended
so the judge may or may not do that.

640
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,775
The Act was even amended.

641
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,321
Why did you quit working as a judge?

642
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,743
What are you doing here?

643
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,877
Eleven years ago,
you called me an asshole, judge.

644
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,211
You must be relieved that

645
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,256
the criminal statutory limitations
and civil statute of limitations

646
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,466
have expired.

647
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,012
But I'll make sure these people
who are within the statutory limitations

648
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,181
will be punished.

649
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,766
I'll file for compensation, too.

650
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,477
Look, that's not an attitude of a thief,
is it?

651
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,104
The bitterness of the law.

652
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,734
I heard the Legal Clinic here

653
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,654
provides free legal consultations.

654
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,823
Please help me out, Professor Kim Eun-suk.

655
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,246
-What's he saying?
-He'll sue people who wrote hate comments?

656
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,334
This is

657
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,003
a sacred classroom.

658
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,468
These malicious comments are very evil.

659
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:45,140
Let's say I get 500,000 won per person
as compensation.

660
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,060
I'd be sitting on a pile of money.

661
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,061
If you help me out,

662
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,564
I'll consider making a donation here.

663
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,652
If they wish, I'll also give
some compensation for my victim.

664
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,242
What? Compensation?

665
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,829
I guess she might not need that.

666
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,871
Figures.

667
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,668
I already paid for my crime
according to the state's sentencing.

668
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,920
Hey.

669
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,883
Why the heck
should I be treated like this?

670
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,721
It's not like I'm a serial killer.

671
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,598
I was drunk! I don't remember a thing.

672
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,768
But 11 years.
I rot in prison for 11 years.

673
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,479
Do you think I have nothing to say?
This is unfair.

674
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,107
This is unfair for me!

675
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,029
Unfair? Did you say it's unfair?

676
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,907
Are you going to kill him?

677
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,585
Depending on your intention,
it'll be either homicide or manslaughter.

678
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,382
If you wished to kill him,
it's attempted murder if you let go.

679
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,389
Professor Kim.

680
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,729
-Goodness.
-Professor Kim!

681
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,815
-Professor Kim!
-My gosh.

682
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,860
Professor Kim.

683
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,743
Call 911.

684
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,421
AMBULANCE

685
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,341
-How many weeks?
-At 22 weeks, 3 days.

686
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,675
-Bleeding?
-15 minutes.

687
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,593
Get Dr. Lee now.

688
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,636
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

689
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,268
Professor, are you okay?

690
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,186
I'm fine, right?

691
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,857
She's still bleeding.

692
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,193
What should I do?
Dr. Lee's surgery is delayed.

693
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,403
If you're in a hurryâ€¦

694
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,869
Professor, may I take a look?

695
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,585
All right.

696
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,260
I didn't know you came here, too,
prosecutor.

697
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,807
Gosh, that kid from before.

698
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,560
I'll get him locked up
for attempted murder.

699
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:41,024
Everyone there had a look
as if I deserved to die,

700
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,818
so they aren't going to help.

701
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,990
Could you be my witness?

702
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,410
You know, everything you saw. Please?

703
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,293
Oh, so you didn't see anything?

704
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,796
Well, figures.
I also said I never saw anything.

705
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,340
Still remember nothing?

706
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,058
I wonder if Judge Kim's kid is okay.

707
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,937
Blood.

708
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,024
If she lost blood, it can't be any good.

709
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:26,111
September 10th, 2008. The license plate
of the hit-and-run driver at Jurae-dong.

710
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,573
The accident for that kid
who witnessed your rape.

711
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,243
If I remembered anything,

712
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,246
what I said about
getting too drunk to remember

713
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,457
turns into a total lie.

714
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,170
Why are you so obsessed?

715
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,714
You aren't a prosecutor anymore.

716
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,095
Because that hit-and-run case
is my only cold case.

717
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,349
I see. What a shame.

718
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,809
Goodness, what a shame.

719
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,021
If I hadn't been so drunk,

720
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,148
I would've remembered that number.

721
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,318
I hope you'd remember it soon.

722
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,820
The statutory limitation expires soon.

723
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,949
Right, the statutory limitation.

724
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,331
Tell Professor Kimâ€¦

725
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,585
that I hope she gets better soon

726
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,754
and delivers her baby safely.

727
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,672
You canâ€¦

728
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,468
remember that number now.

729
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,402
I might remember something
once I take this off.

730
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,781
Darn it.

731
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:09,214
OCTOBER 2020, PRESENT

732
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,189
Did you look into it?

733
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,649
Yes, I did, prosecutor.

734
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:33,238
As you said, professor, Lee Man-ho
was at Hankuk University yesterday

735
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,032
but left in the morning.

736
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,743
He remained outside
until the time of the incident.

737
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,287
I can't tell you anything else.

738
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,206
Detective Jang got mad at me

739
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,625
for letting you into the crime scene
yesterday.

740
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,919
We never talked on the phone.

741
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,504
Yes, goodbye.

742
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,566
07P 4295

743
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,279
HANKUK ESTABLISHED
MODERN LEGAL EDUCATION

744
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,114
DEFAMATION CASES

745
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,949
GO SEE A DOCTOR FOR SNORING

746
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,284
I snore when I sleep?

747
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,202
PHONE ON SILENT

748
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,244
Do I snore?

749
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,038
-Do you? I'm not sure.
-You do.

750
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,832
And very loudly.

751
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,126
Was this you?

752
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,674
I saw Professor Seo in my dream last night
just as he looked when he died.

753
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,803
I'm not studying in my right mind.

754
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,056
How many are those?

755
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,683
He got as many as I did.

756
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,229
You picked up
every single defamation case in Korea.

757
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,274
I went through so much trouble
to find this one because of Joon-hwi.

758
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,985
This one and this one. I found those.

759
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,363
Did you bring everything?

760
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,406
We'll pick cases we might see on a test.

761
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,576
Let's pass cases that stated facts
since it's to be discarded.

762
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,494
No.

763
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,290
Professors love questioning us
on reasons why it should be discarded.

764
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,750
I'll pick out a few for you.

765
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,668
-Wait.
-Look.

766
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,961
One second.

767
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,549
First, Article 310 of the Criminal Code--

768
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,134
Wait, she's not here.

769
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,053
We aren't losing time
for someone who's late.

770
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,888
Shocking news!

771
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,182
I WON'T BE SAD FOR A DRUGGIE

772
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,851
I heard Professor Seo did drugs.

773
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,227
-What?
-What?

774
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,773
They found meth
in his office and in his car.

775
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,568
That makes no sense.

776
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,611
MY HUBBY

777
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,822
Leave it on silent.

778
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,283
This was you?

779
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,993
PHONE ON SILENT

780
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,202
Look at this.

781
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,289
"I won't be sad for a druggie."

782
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,374
In the study group?

783
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,292
I'M NOT SURE

784
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,169
-When will it end?
-Druggie.

785
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,253
That makes no sense.

786
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,754
Drugs?

787
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,054
SEO BYUNG-JU OF HANKUK UNIVERSITY
HAD BEEN A DRUG ABUSER

788
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,106
COPY ROOM

789
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,237
If he was an addict,

790
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,948
he more likely died in an accident
or killed himself.

791
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,576
Maybe they killed him
wanting us to think like that.

792
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,119
Then the culprit isâ€¦

793
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,955
The room where Professor Seo died

794
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,583
is only accessible
through the courtroom we were in

795
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,376
and the door only professors can use.

796
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,922
-Give me a hand.
-But only we were there during the break.

797
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,050
I don't recall seeing any outsiders
other than that deliveryman.

798
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,344
Where can I find Mr. Seo Byung-ju?

799
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,511
Go through this door.

800
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,721
Thank you.

801
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,642
And the deliveryman came right out
after he went to drop it off.

802
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,481
So there might be a tragedy where
one of us gets arrested as a murdererâ€¦

803
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,326
Can you tell him I'm in the shower?

804
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,331
You've reached Jeon Ye-seul's phone.

805
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,292
Hello.

806
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,086
Ye-seul is in the shower--

807
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:17,879
Hey, Yeong-chang.

808
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,381
No, it's okay.

809
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,466
No.

810
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,302
All right. Okay.

811
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,179
I should go take a shower instead.

812
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:35,438
Gosh, Yangcrates is taking over
Professor Seo's mock trial class!

813
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,581
On the day of her death,

814
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,709
what did she say
as she drank at your place?

815
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,836
She wanted to break up.

816
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,421
And what did you say?

817
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,588
That I didn't want to.

818
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,426
Things weren't great for Ro-na
after becoming a solo artist.

819
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,262
She got depressed
and often said she wanted to die.

820
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,140
It's not that she didn't like me.

821
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,892
Everything was tormenting for her.

822
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,438
You wanted to keep the victim safe,

823
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,398
yet the victim

824
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,192
wanted to take her own life
and injected pentobarbital?

825
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,069
Yes.

826
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,197
I got it to euthanize my dog,

827
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,074
but I never imagined she'd do that.

828
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,243
I should've managed it better.

829
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,453
MOCK TRIAL: CASE FILE

830
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,706
These are needle marks on her right arm
from the day of the incident.

831
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,667
You said she's left-handed,
so she can inject the drug herself.

832
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,502
Yes.

833
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,173
The victim had fear of needles,

834
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,342
so she never got an IV
in her girl group days.

835
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,553
If she refused to be put on IV
at a hospital,

836
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,972
could she really have stabbed her body

837
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,099
not just once but many times?

838
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,559
If she wanted to kill herselfâ€¦

839
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,441
she could've mixed it with a drink.

840
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,739
Defendant.
Did you know she was afraid of needles?

841
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,707
Everyone, attention.

842
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,877
The police are here

843
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,670
for Professor Seo's case.

844
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,757
Officer Jang Dong-su
of Jungang Police Station.

845
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,510
I'm here to investigate
Professor Seo Byung-ju's death.

846
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,512
I ask for your momentary cooperation.

847
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,307
These are the footprints
found on the scene.

848
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,642
Owners of the footprints

849
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,686
may become suspects
depending on their whereabouts.

850
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,230
First off,

851
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,525
tailor-made dress shoes for men,
size 270mm.

852
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,782
Sneakers, size 275mm,

853
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,867
Air-sweep NB 384.

854
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:01,000
Sneakers, size 270mm, Pro-running AF.

855
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,549
Women's high heels, size 235mm.

856
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:08,633
Those are mine.

857
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,345
I'm the initial witness,
so of course I'm there.

858
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,222
Am I one of the suspects?

859
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,265
No exceptions.

860
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,935
Next, Airmax 507-J,

861
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,395
sneakers, size 275mm.

862
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,028
Maison Pature, limited edition sneakers
for 2020 fall-winter,

863
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,238
size 240mm.

864
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,787
Those cost millions of won.

865
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,914
The autopsy result showed

866
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,918
Professor Seo was murdered
by drug overdose.

867
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,880
The drug, methamphetamine.

868
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,756
-What?
-What?

869
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,009
It's meth mixed with sugar.

870
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,054
You're right. It was a trick.

871
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,642
It looked like
someone forced Professor Seo to drink

872
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,978
a dangerous amount of meth
mixed into his coffee.

873
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,236
This is the disposable coffee cup
used by the campus cafe.

874
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,490
And the plastic bag
found on the day of the incident

875
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,074
in the trash can of the scene.

876
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,119
The same fingerprints
were found on both evidence,

877
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,455
and it's getting identified.

878
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,043
Arresting the culprit
is only a matter of time.

879
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,754
We came here today to give you a chance--

880
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,673
I thought you came to get help,
but you came to threaten them.

881
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,258
I'm not threatening--

882
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,843
Who thinks this is a threat?

883
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,971
When a threat
causes fear in the other party

884
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,556
and meddles with their decision,

885
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,682
it can be punishable.

886
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,519
Who got scared
when he said he's giving a chance?

887
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,355
It almost made my high bun stand.

888
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,814
I didn't even do anything.

889
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,029
Please leave.

890
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,490
-I'm wrapping up Seo's class.
-Professor Yang.

891
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,077
Even if the culprit is here,
they can't leave during class.

892
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,955
Continue the trial.

893
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,793
Prosecution, continue your questioning.

894
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,171
EVIDENCE FROM THE SCENE

895
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,391
Did you know she was afraid of needles?

896
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,309
Of course you didn't.

897
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,394
If you had known,

898
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,231
you wouldn't have scripted a story
that the victim injected the drug herself.

899
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,108
Objection. That's a made-up story.

900
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,234
The defendant did.

901
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,946
You two,
stop talking about made-up stories.

902
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,656
Only state the facts--

903
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,382
Professor Yang Jong-hoon.

904
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,093
You're under emergency arrest
for Seo Byung-ju's murder.

905
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,898
You have the right to remain silent.

906
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,359
You have the right to talk to a lawyer.

907
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,529
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

908
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,753
WAITING ROOM

909
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,480
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE,
UNDER INVESTIGATION

910
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,319
Did you do it alone?

911
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,321
You would've left the country

912
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,865
had we not arrested you.

913
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,075
He was deemed guilty
the moment they cuffed him.

914
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,452
Just confess to the crime.

915
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,746
I'll be done soon. Just talk to him.

916
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,830
Fire Yang Jong-hoon.

917
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,082
Then change the rules and get him fired!

918
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,209
If the Ministry allows,
I want to defend Yang.

919
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,211
Then quit your job and defend him.

920
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,589
What's with you and Seo?
I know there's something.

921
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,008
Because Mr. Seo is his uncle.

922
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,594
I have no idea why your name is
in your uncle's will

923
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,304
he had written before he died.

924
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,389
Even if Professor Yang
actually killed him,

925
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,892
I hate you more than him.

926
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,727
The Jurae-dong hit-and-run.

927
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,271
-Now, do you remember?
-This is what I saw.

928
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,689
Don't tell me Seo isâ€¦

929
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,316
What about you?

930
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,359
Did you kill him?

931
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,404
From this moment on,
I refuse to give any testimony.

932
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,533
