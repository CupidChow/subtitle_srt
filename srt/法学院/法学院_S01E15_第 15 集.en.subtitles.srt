PUBLICATION OF SUSPECTED CRIME

2
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,608
MADE BY AUTHORITIES BEFORE…

3
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,985
FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW

4
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,488
"Once the media begins to report
on one's charges,

5
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,074
it will plant presupposition and bias
on the judges.

6
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,868
This damages
the defendant's right to a fair trial."

7
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,455
"The defendant may be innocent,
but the damage cannot be restored."

8
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,915
We should assert…

9
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,211
What's wrong? You don't like that?

10
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,545
APPLICANT: JIN HYEONG-U

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,465
Why? It's well-written.

12
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,051
This seems good enough
to be up against Prof. Kang Ju-man.

13
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,012
I get that you'd rather have
Prof. Yang write this,

14
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,889
but he said he can't do that.

15
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,225
So why can't he do it?

16
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,893
JIN HYEONG-U

17
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,103
APPLICANT'S TESTIFIER: YANG JONG-HOON

18
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,980
CONCERNED PARTY: KANG SOL

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,315
PRINT

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:53,113
TESTIFIER STATEMENT

21
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,458
How can you be Prosecutor Jin's testifier?

22
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,336
My opinion is that it's unconstitutional.

23
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,047
Then why were you so keen
on having Jin indicted?

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,799
I needed to get him in court.

25
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,717
You did what I couldn't do.

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,719
You weren't helping me.

27
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,805
You used me to get what you wanted.

28
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,806
"Used"?

29
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,101
You knew if Jin gets indicted,
he'd request a constitutional review,

30
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,144
and used me, right?

31
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,563
-If you shared your intention--
-My intention?

32
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,482
What's my intention?

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,571
My father passed away

34
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,158
due to his publication of my dad's
suspected crime, but you--

35
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,784
It's yours to prove on the trial.

36
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,120
It must be found constitutional
for the trial--

37
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,788
Then you shouldn't be here now.

38
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,001
Prosecutor Jin and I
won't be an easy fight.

39
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,802
THIS ARTICLE CONTRADICTS
THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY

40
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,679
AND MUST BE ABOLISHED

41
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,534
Is that enough to convince the judges?

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
If publication of suspected crime
is allowed,

43
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,000
they say it contradicts
the presumption of innocence.

44
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,586
It's not to break
the presumption of innocence.

45
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,839
The people commissioned us
as investigative authorities,

46
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,383
so it's only natural for us to disclose

47
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,302
the suspected crime
after an investigation.

48
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,345
Especially when…

49
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,848
a key presidential candidate
such as Ko Hyeong-su

50
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,141
or other high officials

51
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,477
are investigated
for crimes and corruption…

52
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,940
the people should absolutely have
the right to know.

53
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,027
Now that's a good argument.

54
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,494
Is this why you made me

55
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,079
the first prosecutor in Korea

56
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,540
to be indicted for violating
Article 126 of the Criminal Code?

57
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,919
A constitutional review
can be requested only with a trial.

58
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,630
How did you know
I'd request a constitutional review?

59
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,215
I would've done the same.

60
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,261
OFFICER CHO YE-BUM

61
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,308
OFFICER CHO YE-BUM

62
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,519
If you have questions, ask me.

63
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,271
His internship is over.

64
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,399
Don't contact my student in secret
and make him rat on them.

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,901
POWER OFF

66
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,654
What was that? Did he hang up?

67
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,490
He needs to know that we know.

68
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,908
Squeak, squeak.

69
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,746
Not everyone can be a spy,

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,040
and you aren't cut out for that.

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,959
What do you mean?

72
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,836
I bet everyone thinks it's you.

73
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,879
You wrote Seung-jae's complaint, too.

74
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,007
It was a part of my internship.

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,341
I had to do as he asked.

76
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,510
I get that you want to be a prosecutor

77
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,804
and made a mistake
trying to be on his good side.

78
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,806
But still, Prosecutor Jin?

79
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,685
Sol.

80
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,146
I don't know why I did that.

81
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,441
I'll take care of this, so--

82
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,984
You can leave the study group.

83
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,030
Then he'll have no reason to use you.

84
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,073
Joon-hwi.

85
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,409
How can you say that to me?

86
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,912
You of all people can't say that to me.

87
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,414
Why do you think I did that?

88
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,999
During the internship,

89
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,085
the guy who passed the second round
got all the attention.

90
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,005
I was practically invisible next to you.

91
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,301
I'm not the type who doesn't get noticed,

92
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,429
but next to you, I was just…

93
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,181
I get how you feel.

94
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,225
I've also suffered enough
with smarties at home and at school.

95
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,102
Only you get me.

96
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,354
Stop talking, and take care of this.

97
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,732
You said only I get you, right?

98
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,317
Then do me a favor.

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,277
Okay, shoot away.

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,821
It's about that absurd vlog you film.

101
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,947
My vlog?

102
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,865
Yes.

103
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,827
What would've happened had the facts
about Lee Man-ho's sexual assault case

104
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,246
been published
through the proper channels?

105
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,083
He would not have been ruled
"feeble-minded" so easily,

106
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,170
and we could've prevented the verdict
which the public at large deemed unjust.

107
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,755
He oddly has a point.

108
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,592
Politicians who applaud publication
of allegations involving their opponents

109
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,469
and lash out when it happens to them

110
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,388
should no longer be allowed
to take advantage of the provision.

111
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,892
When did Ji-ho find out
Prof. Yang is his testifier?

112
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,685
He didn't say anything to us?

113
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,651
Article 126 of the Criminal Code
could not keep your father safe.

114
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,488
Who do you think benefits the most
from this law?

115
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,325
No other countries

116
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,080
have such a general and broad provision
against publication of suspected crime.

117
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,290
Regarding similar cases
in other countries,

118
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,211
Ms. Erica Shin, a lawyer
and comparative law expert at Harvard

119
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,381
who was also selected as a witness,
will virtually join us.

120
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,633
Are we ready for this video call?

121
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,470
He betrayed us to help Prosecutor Jin.
And what's all this fuss about?

122
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,639
They won't win anyway.

123
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,349
CONSTITUTION

124
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,609
Hello, I'm Erica Shin.

125
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,752
I'd like to thank Prof. Yang Jong-hoon
and the Constitutional Court

126
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,671
for this chance to share my opinion.

127
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,805
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

128
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,689
Look at the view count.

129
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,941
She totally made me do this.

130
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,152
Hey, doesn't this mean it's a huge hit?

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,696
I'm frightened.

132
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,449
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

133
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,912
Why didn't you tell me?

134
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,665
She asked me not to.

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,585
She said she'd call you in time
and asked me to stay quiet.

136
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,837
"In time"?

137
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,675
When is that time?

138
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,976
I believe it's now.

139
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,028
Hello?

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,738
It's me.

141
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,865
"It's me"?

142
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,492
Have you been well?

143
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,204
Have I been well?

144
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,789
How's Mom?

145
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,666
Is Byeol also--

146
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,132
Criminal Code Article 126
on publication of suspected crime

147
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,301
only exists in the Republic of Korea.

148
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,721
Before we take a look at other precedents
in other countries,

149
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,016
we must first consider
the biggest beneficiaries

150
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,227
of this clause in the law.

151
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,772
Erica Shin?

152
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,994
I was about to call you right now.

153
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,621
Do you have any money?

154
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,622
Money?

155
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,375
What makes you think I have any money?

156
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,627
I'm living off a line of credit.

157
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,380
Can you take out some cash
from that account then?

158
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,175
My landlord wants to raise the rent.
What can I do?

159
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,969
Otherwise, we'll have to move out.

160
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,517
Who knew Sol had a twin sister?

161
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,060
They look the same.

162
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,895
Hey.

163
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,775
They only look the same.

164
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,235
She went to Harvard Law.

165
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,404
She's not in her league with that career.

166
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,323
Anyway, why is she named Erica Shin?

167
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,199
Sol looked surprised, too.

168
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,534
Did you know?

169
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,870
Don't get curious. You'll get hurt.

170
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,246
Hold your horses.

171
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,666
I'm starting to get scared.

172
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,837
If you're that scared, take it down.

173
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,214
No, he's about to get the silver medal.

174
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,842
You're at 100,000 subscribers?

175
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,094
He had a good reason
when he uploaded that video

176
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,721
as if he was forced.

177
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,308
What I'm really curious about
is Ko's response.

178
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,312
The video blew up like this,
but why is he as quiet as a mouse?

179
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,106
He was in the media,
so he probably put an embargo on this.

180
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,317
And he won't take a legal measure.

181
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,904
He can't sue him for spreading falsehood,
but I thought he'd threaten him.

182
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,739
Did you see the bulletin?

183
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,786
Someone raised an issue
on how Yeong-chang came to the dorm.

184
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,666
What? No way.

185
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,627
They're saying we should kick her out
and have her punished.

186
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,586
They're furious.

187
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,879
Hey, don't look.

188
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,506
They want all of you,

189
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,801
from Ye-seul, who gave him a key,
to Sol and Joon-hwi, who let him go

190
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,802
although you knew.

191
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,555
But why did this suddenly resurface…

192
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,768
He wasn't staying quiet.

193
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,443
MOM

194
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,531
MOM

195
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,740
I sent you some tonic.

196
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,201
You'll compete
in the Justice Mock Trial, right?

197
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,956
This was delivered.

198
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,791
HERBAL TONIC

199
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,084
I'm throwing it out.

200
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,419
Why? It must be expensive.

201
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,170
You can have it then.

202
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,548
Again?

203
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,684
While you were busy
stabbing the kids in the back,

204
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,978
they also caused huge trouble.

205
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,438
Take a look.

206
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,899
RELAY VIDEO:
EXPOSING ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

207
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,235
If they want to make a case
against Ko Hyeong-su,

208
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,945
they should at least buckle up.

209
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,947
You can be their help,

210
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,409
just as you saved me
by making Ko abandon Lee Man-ho.

211
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,536
That happened by chance.

212
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,832
Assemblyman Ko was the one
who sent Lee's son to the U.S.

213
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,834
I gave him the Lee Man-ho Act

214
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,336
in exchange for the life of Lee's son
as James.

215
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
He's living a good life as James now.

216
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,801
If Ko Hyeong-su didn't ask James
to send them his recent photo…

217
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,969
Your photo?

218
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,847
Okay. Let me call you back.

219
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,392
I wouldn't have known that Lee Man-ho
had been in contact with Ko.

220
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,480
I had no idea why he broke his promise
to never talk about his son again

221
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,733
and wanted to make a deal
with a man like Lee Man-ho.

222
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,652
What if the world finds out

223
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,448
you made a deal with Lee Man-ho
after you enacted the Lee Man-ho Act?

224
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,659
You threatened him? That's unlike you.

225
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,412
To get Ko to abandon Lee Man-ho?

226
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,705
Threaten him?

227
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,124
I gave him a warning
disguised as a piece of advice.

228
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,591
So he got scared Lee Man-ho will talk
and took the bait.

229
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,845
How could he do anything like this
as a human?

230
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,222
-Darn it!
-I wish to have…

231
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,894
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,
you can't do this to me!

232
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,189
He was suffocated by him,
then the news was all over the media.

233
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,691
At that point,
it doesn't matter what Lee says.

234
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,237
Ko Hyeong-su can easily say
he's talking nonsense

235
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,696
due to his grudge against him.

236
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,366
And who would the people believe?

237
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,326
Lee Man-ho knew that.

238
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,912
That's why he kept quiet,
trying to make a deal with Ko.

239
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,499
But I pried for his connection
and tried to make a deal on his sentence.

240
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,168
So in the end,
Ko Hyeong-su got rid of him.

241
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
That jerk…

242
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,300
Then we took part in Lee Man-ho's death.

243
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,386
And I took part in saving you.

244
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,601
Ye-seul must be insane.

245
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,436
She sued me?

246
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,730
I'll get you an attorney.

247
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,190
Just go get questioned.

248
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,150
I have a phobia against lawsuits!

249
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,112
Dad, you need to stop this.

250
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,864
It'll hurt you, too.

251
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,449
Stopping the lawsuit
isn't the solution to this.

252
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,161
I have a plan in my mind. Okay?

253
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,879
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

254
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,427
Hey, get started on your task.

255
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,765
I found this photo while looking
for the reason of the disclosure.

256
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,897
It's Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,
the prosecutor's acquaintance,

257
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,399
and Cho Tae-yeong,
the CEO of TOYGOODTOY's competitor,

258
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,776
who's also Assemblyman Ko's
head supporter.

259
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,696
If Seo Gi-yeol's son brings up my name
into this matter…

260
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,364
Will you sue him?

261
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,867
I can only stop the reporters for a while.

262
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,203
We should do that
to make people stop assuming, so…

263
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,955
You want to say it's not true?

264
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,211
That's what they're after.

265
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,757
They want to investigate
and see if this is true or false.

266
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,762
They're law students.

267
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,848
And Yang Jong-hoon is behind them,
waiting for a chance to get me.

268
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,561
Then are you going to do that again?

269
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,484
I should use that method.

270
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,487
What? What do you mean?

271
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,033
Our policy changed to differentiate
the credit line level for law students.

272
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,535
Our previous policy was established

273
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,747
back when over 80 percent of law students
passed the bar exam.

274
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,582
But at this point,

275
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,001
the percentage dropped
to 50 percent and less,

276
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,295
so many candidates
never make it in the law.

277
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,923
So the level depends on my grades?

278
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,008
Yes, that's the change in our policy.

279
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,262
If you have bad grades,
your credit line will be adjusted, too.

280
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,014
We need your report card.

281
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,016
How does this make any sense?

282
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,477
Why did the policy suddenly change?

283
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,024
What if I barely managed to pass the year?

284
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,445
Your current loan already exceeds
the credit limit of our changed policy,

285
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,989
so we can't give you any more loans.

286
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,119
You must pay back the amount
exceeding the limit by next month.

287
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,288
So loans are decided on grades, too?

288
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,794
HANJU BANK

289
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,299
ADJUSTMENTS FOR GPA 2.3 AND UNDER

290
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,885
Students who win an award
in the Justice Mock Trial Competition

291
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,012
are exempt?

292
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,058
Are you competing
in the Justice Mock Trial?

293
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,309
No.

294
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,603
-I'll do a civil case. Join me.
-No.

295
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,521
What?

296
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,443
Ji-ho, this says your dad took his life
after embezzling the company fund.

297
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,360
What is this?

298
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,449
There's a comment from this guy
who claimed to have been a manager…

299
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,369
No way. Did Sol serve time in juvie?

300
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,704
And for school violence?

301
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,914
Someone posted photos, too.

302
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,675
YANG WAS SOL'S PROSECUTOR
AND NOW TEACHES HER

303
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,469
KANG SOL GOT IN THANKS TO YANG?

304
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,558
I knew people would expose our info,

305
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,809
but now that they have,

306
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,644
I'm worried about the others.

307
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,272
So you got in trouble without a plan?

308
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,858
We had to cause trouble to find a plan.

309
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,943
We won't sit around and get bullied.

310
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,823
What about the guest book from the funeral
Seo and Ko went to together?

311
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,701
If they didn't lose it…

312
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,911
She had three children.

313
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,289
I'm sure one of them
may tell us the truth.

314
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,711
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

315
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,965
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

316
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,513
Are you here to see me?

317
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,474
No, sir.

318
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,269
Come in for a moment.
I have to talk to you.

319
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,313
I won't go inside.

320
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,403
Your father could've been
the dean of this school.

321
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,074
You know that
he quit because of you, right?

322
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,952
Then you should lie low.

323
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:44,248
You shouldn't associate with troublemakers
who attack Assemblyman Ko

324
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,792
who works hard for our law school.

325
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,254
Think of your father and--

326
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,048
If you're concerned about me,
I'd like to turn it down.

327
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,014
That cheeky brat.

328
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,016
Professor.

329
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,310
Did you send for me?

330
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,569
Hey.

331
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,779
Have you seen Kang Sol B? My roomie.

332
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,123
Hey, you know,
if you win the Justice Mock Trial,

333
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,209
it'll help you become
a judicial researcher, right?

334
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,503
You saw the photo in the comments?

335
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,423
What? The photo? What photo?

336
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,889
HEY, SOL, DID YOU FORGET YOUR JUVIE DAYS?

337
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,057
Darn it.

338
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,227
Take the photo down now

339
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,646
before I file a criminal charge
over portrait rights.

340
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,568
What are you doing?

341
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,612
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY ME FOR THE DAMAGE

342
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,031
There are no clauses
in the Criminal Code for this.

343
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,534
You didn't know it's a civil case?

344
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,660
Of course I knew.

345
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,995
I got angry and confused.

346
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,289
Go with defamation
and make it a criminal case.

347
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,332
I can't. It's true.

348
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,461
I agree that we should abolish
defamation for stating facts.

349
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,672
The comment isn't the problem.

350
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,258
You didn't make it as the court's intern,

351
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,093
so you should win that competition.

352
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,639
Even for me,
it's tough to win an award there.

353
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,642
Then Joon-hwi, too. Two plus one.

354
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,394
I won't be a freeloader
or become a nuisance.

355
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,313
The three of us should compete.

356
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,983
I have a dire reason
to win an award in that competition.

357
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,237
If you want to win, it can't be you.

358
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,113
Maybe your twin sister.

359
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,119
I wasn't going to say this to you, but…

360
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,459
It's a matter of survival.

361
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,047
LAW OFFICER LOAN

362
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,007
ADJUSTMENTS FOR GPA 2.3 AND UNDER

363
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,301
Come on, say something.

364
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,972
Well, you should at least consider.

365
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,144
How much do you need?

366
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,067
If you need money, I'll lend you some.

367
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,322
Hey, we lived together for a while
as roommates.

368
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,074
How can you be so harsh?

369
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,867
She was shaken.

370
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,868
What?

371
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,712
GET OUT, IF YOU WON'T LEAVE, I WILL

372
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,046
CONSIDERING A CLASS ACTION

373
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,298
STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM

374
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,882
YOU'LL CRIPPLE YOUR NEXT BOYFRIEND

375
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,718
SO WHEN? GET OUT!

376
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,038
I apologize for having caused trouble.

377
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,957
I will…

378
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,211
move out of the dorm.

379
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,341
And I also apologize
for damaging the reputation…

380
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,012
of my fellow female students.

381
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,599
But please remember this.

382
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,227
As a woman,

383
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,064
I was tormented by his violence.

384
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,111
I was scared of his threats
and conciliation,

385
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,782
but as a law student,

386
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,536
although it wasn't enough,
I did the best I could to stay honorable.

387
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:58,001
And thanks to all of you
who study the law with me here,

388
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,962
I was able to return.

389
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,267
How superficial.

390
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,775
Hey.

391
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,781
Superficial?

392
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,867
You of all people can't say that.

393
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,785
What?

394
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,247
You got the court internship
Sol B couldn't and saw her trial.

395
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,373
So what if I saw it?

396
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,292
If you did, you couldn't say
it was superficial as a woman.

397
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,169
No, you should not.

398
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,423
It was finalized after the first trial.
Haven't you read it?

399
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,717
What do you mean? I read everything--

400
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,553
Don't even try to lie to me.

401
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,513
You should give it a read.

402
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,432
If you think she's superficial
after you read that,

403
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,518
you're the one who should move out.

404
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,355
Whatever, ex-convict.

405
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,900
Right, that?

406
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,986
Isn't that amazing?

407
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,572
A juvenile delinquent
becomes a student at Hankuk Law.

408
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,407
Doesn't that seem amazing?

409
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,869
She overcame her dark history

410
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,829
and became an officer in law.

411
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,623
People love these stories, no?

412
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,541
What is it?

413
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,170
She says she'll make it big in law
because she's an ex-convict.

414
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,504
My gosh.

415
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,340
If you interned at the court,

416
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,258
you should know

417
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,845
getting sent to a juvenile hall
isn't a part of criminal punishment.

418
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,014
It doesn't leave a record,

419
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,559
so if you call her an ex-convict,
shouldn't you be ashamed as a law student?

420
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,611
LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY, LECTURE ROOM

421
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,241
SELECT

422
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,162
If you told them off for me,

423
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,705
does it mean you'll compete?

424
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,250
If you need money--

425
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,377
I don't want money to come between us.

426
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,588
What I need isn't your money

427
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,382
but your generous heart to help me.

428
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,010
Be honest.

429
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,554
You are thinking about it, right?

430
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,680
Get away from me.

431
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,184
I wasn't going to be this patronizing,

432
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,229
but I let people think
I was Prof. Kang's daughter

433
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,773
to help you get less stressed out.

434
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,234
Did I ever rub that in your face

435
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,486
despite all the misunderstanding
and hatred?

436
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,657
How's the trial going?

437
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,451
It's all right.

438
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,622
I'm doing it without an attorney.

439
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,500
Then it'll get rough.

440
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,712
Not as rough as the time
I got questioned by you.

441
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,134
And I deserve it anyway.

442
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,347
Anyway,

443
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,558
the comments on that video
are really malicious.

444
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,810
Is everyone okay?

445
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,146
How would they be okay?

446
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,482
It's just that they can hold out.

447
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,488
Seung-jae, I have a favor to ask.

448
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,156
Isn't that why you came?

449
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,952
Everything but hacking.

450
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,123
I looked into the students

451
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,041
from your med school…

452
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,006
What? The president?

453
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,466
Do you know how agitated the president is

454
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,886
because of that malicious video
on Assemblyman Ko?

455
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,057
Well, it's not that I wanted to upload it.

456
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,600
If you get on his bad side,

457
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,228
your life at school will be hard.

458
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,816
And I'll be teaching practical classes
on the prosecution next year.

459
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,362
You know that you need good grades
on that subject to be a prosecutor, right?

460
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,197
Of course I do.

461
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,241
What can I do?

462
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,579
Yes, president.

463
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,334
Yes, I understand.

464
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,710
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

465
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,129
Professor, what should I do?

466
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,258
Drop that video
before the president asks to see you,

467
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,761
and upload a public apology
to Assemblyman Ko…

468
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,430
An apology video?

469
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,830
Embezzlement?

470
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,249
They're killing my dad twice.

471
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,797
My dad wouldn't embezzle money--

472
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,799
You're right. He wouldn't.

473
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,259
The prosecution found nothing
on his embezzlement

474
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,178
when they investigated his suicide.

475
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,472
So defamation of the deceased--

476
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,598
Let's wait and see.

477
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,725
It can't be just an individual.

478
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,519
He wanted to wait and see.

479
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,729
Prof. Yang looked into this?

480
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,065
Let's see.

481
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,734
Is your back okay
after you got stabbed by him?

482
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
No.

483
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,034
But I don't think he betrayed me.

484
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,746
Jin Hyeong-u leaked it out,
but Ko Hyeong-su instigated it.

485
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,833
In the end,
my target is the same as Prof. Yang.

486
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,337
And it's true that Ko is playing around
with Article 126.

487
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,215
But I'll fight to the end.

488
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,843
I believe it's constitutional.

489
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,722
Jin Hyeong-u should've turned him down.

490
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,681
If he had,

491
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,975
my dad wouldn't have become a victim.

492
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,105
I'll make sure
I win and make Jin Hyeong-u pay.

493
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,566
I'm on your side.

494
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,570
Okay. Let's fight to the end
and win this case.

495
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,409
We couldn't show our mock court properly

496
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,494
after a man died in there,

497
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,996
so I was disheartened.

498
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,457
But Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su said

499
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,335
he'll do his best to hold
the Justice Mock Trial Competition here.

500
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,630
Did you call me out here

501
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,925
just to share that with me?

502
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,969
How can they slander a man like him

503
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,722
who always does his best
to help out his alma mater?

504
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,892
The students who were in that video
damaged our school's reputation--

505
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,935
You shouldn't punish them rashly.

506
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,570
You put me out of office
for damaging our school's reputation,

507
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,448
but you did it for nothing, correct?

508
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,241
It was a shameful moment

509
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,869
for a school that teaches the law.

510
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,331
That's because the police didn't conduct
a proper initial investigation--

511
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,583
Did you listen to what they said
on the video?

512
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,211
-If it's true--
-It's not true!

513
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,046
They're slandering him!

514
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,215
It's true. Everything is factual.

515
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,511
You should cut Ko Hyeong-su off
while you have a chance, President Lee.

516
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,015
And you're the one who should be
doing his best for the school.

517
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
DATE AND TIME

518
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,353
QUALIFICATIONS

519
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,821
You are interested.

520
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,118
You want to,
but not after your mom's suggestion?

521
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,539
It seems like you want to do it.

522
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,583
Let's do it together then.

523
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,879
Why do you try so hard to persuade me?

524
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,174
Why do you care so much about my roomie?

525
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,761
I'm grateful for her.

526
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,139
Are you sure it'll be okay

527
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,308
for you to record a video?

528
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,811
I won't be okay.

529
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,230
I'll be shattered into pieces.

530
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,946
If it hadn't been for Ko Hyeong-su,

531
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,906
your uncle may not have been involved

532
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,950
in that hit-and-run incident.

533
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,037
And if so, he probably wouldn't have taken
the free land.

534
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,749
Then your uncle wouldn't have been killed,

535
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:21,004
and you wouldn't have been framed
for killing your uncle whom you adored.

536
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,173
If it hadn't been for Ko,

537
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,050
Dan…

538
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,178
wouldn't have left in such a hurry.

539
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,849
Ji-ho's dad
also wouldn't have passed away,

540
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,850
and Ye-seul…

541
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,148
I feel like I owe her,

542
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,318
and I hate owing people.

543
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,492
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL
COMPETITION APPLICATION

544
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,834
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

545
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,756
Hello?

546
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,717
Right now?

547
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,928
Yes, sir.

548
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,271
What--

549
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,814
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL

550
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,608
NAME: HAN JOON-HWI, KANG SOL

551
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,780
KANG SOL A

552
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,615
Hello?

553
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,034
Hey, our professor wants us
at the hideout.

554
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,619
Prof. Yang?

555
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,747
Prof. Yang asked us to come.

556
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,624
Right now?

557
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,835
What time does he think it is now?

558
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,975
I lost my world since I lost you.

559
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,102
I have no reason to live.

560
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,064
I feel like my entire body is paralyzed,
not just the lower half.

561
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,779
I'd like to take this chance
to share my sincere apology to her.

562
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,200
I loved her so much
that I dreamed of marrying her.

563
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,494
When she got into law school,

564
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,788
I felt belittled
as we had prepared together.

565
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,749
I deeply regret and want to apologize

566
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,210
for causing an irrevocable wound
in her heart.

567
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,422
Now that I am crippled,

568
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,925
I finally realized what I have done.

569
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,183
I sincerely apologize

570
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,353
to Ms. Jeon and our people

571
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,480
whom my foolish son

572
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,108
have hurt deeply.

573
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,485
Please put the blame

574
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,198
on this father
who didn't bring him up properly.

575
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,243
And law students of Hankuk University,

576
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,287
please do not get abused

577
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,707
as a vessel in political slandering
against me.

578
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,250
Political slandering?

579
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,002
It's like him.

580
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,296
I can't watch him. Makes me feel sick.

581
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,298
As a politician,

582
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,176
I will pay the price…

583
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,343
FREE LAND

584
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,346
…for not bringing up my son properly
through legislations,

585
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,517
starting with reinforcing punishment
for dating abuse cases.

586
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,979
I will repay you
by working as hard as I can.

587
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,773
Where was this uploaded?

588
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,275
KO HYEONG-SU'S APOLOGY

589
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:30,985
What?

590
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,028
Wait, hey.

591
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,529
Why is this…

592
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,656
I received support and help
for all the laws

593
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,116
-Well, I…
-I put into motion

594
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,284
-Wait.
-from a professor

595
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,829
of Hankuk Law School, Prof. Kim Eun-suk.

596
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,791
-Together, we will do our best
-What?

597
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,044
to amend the laws regarding dating abuse.

598
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,131
Why is Prof. Kim with that man?

599
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,341
To make a law, he said.

600
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:59,305
Also, I'd like to use this chance
to suggest Ms. Jeon, who is also a student

601
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,642
of Prof. Kim Eun-suk,

602
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,020
-to join us in this process.
-Crazy…

603
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,356
What's he asking her to do with him?

604
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,858
My gosh. Why are we watching this?

605
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,444
Why don't you accept it?

606
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,031
Assemblyman Ko's offer.

607
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,199
-Prof. Kim!
-Prof. Kim!

608
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,743
You'll be doing it with me,
so give it a thought.

609
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,289
Goodness, why does my face look so big?

610
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,959
How did you film this video?

611
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,669
I have a bigger face than him?

612
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,753
You do.

613
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,256
I need to talk to you.

614
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,426
Is my face really bigger than his?

615
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,470
I must've been clenching my teeth.

616
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,228
Okay, fine.

617
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,856
I'll tell you. I'll talk.

618
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,899
President Lee told Prof. Jung

619
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,569
to make Ye-bum upload an apology video.

620
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,322
The great Yangcrates looks like
he has no idea what I'm up to.

621
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,448
I love it.

622
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,366
It was Prof. Kim?

623
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,661
I just did as she told me.

624
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,205
She's the mastermind behind this?

625
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,917
The press conference where he proposed
the abolishment of defamation by facts

626
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,878
was also her idea.

627
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,631
She did that to have an upper hand
for the trial of Bad FaMa.

628
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,383
But what's this one for?

629
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,678
How did Prof. Kim come up with an idea
to put on this show?

630
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,263
I'm so disappointed.

631
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,806
I didn't think of her like this.

632
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,476
She even gave him a big hand
during Ko Hyeong-su's lecture.

633
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,896
Maybe she wants to go into politics.

634
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,022
I don't think so.

635
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,441
People love the Ko family's video,

636
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,860
but our video is covered
with malicious comments.

637
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,363
I'll say what they're doing is nothing
but a B-grade show.

638
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,908
I'm going to accept his offer.

639
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,418
Gosh, is someone talking behind my back?

640
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,632
What's this?

641
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,969
BILL TO PREVENT DATING ABUSE

642
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,429
When did you…

643
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,097
The Sunglasses is considering too.

644
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,560
Thank you, professor,
for becoming my special attorney.

645
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,854
I quit defending you
in the middle of the trial.

646
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,148
He didn't appeal, but be on guard.

647
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,902
If you're still thankful,
you can read it over.

648
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,779
BILL TO PREVENT DATING ABUSE

649
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,659
You already saw through my plan?

650
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,452
A public apology?

651
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,246
I can't believe I'm doing this

652
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,290
because of my foolish son.

653
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,085
I want to propose an act

654
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:39,048
which strengthens punishment
for dating abuse to atone for this.

655
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,385
Proposing laws won't get you exempt.

656
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,470
Exempt? No, it's to atone for what he did.

657
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,765
Only someone like me
could pass the laws I propose.

658
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,102
I'm a key presidential candidate
for a reason.

659
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,313
But I can't just press a button
to pop a legislation out.

660
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,733
And it'll get too old
if you hold another press conference.

661
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,238
That's what concerns me.

662
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,782
You should counter them.

663
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,160
Instead of making him take it down,

664
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,081
you should have him upload your video too.

665
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,461
I can't have you see through me yet.

666
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,172
I don't know the details,

667
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,967
but I only did as Prof. Kim said.

668
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,927
She said

669
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,763
I wouldn't have to delete your video
or upload an apology.

670
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,308
I didn't want to be on Mr. Lee's bad side.

671
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,852
What's wrong is that
he got us on his bad side.

672
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,522
When he finds out what he's like,
he'll regret it bitterly.

673
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,443
Yes, we should reveal his true nature.

674
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,572
I thought you were done defending me.

675
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,116
Hyeongseol is taking Lee's case.

676
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,576
Exactly.

677
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,871
If I did you good,
why didn't you continue to hire me?

678
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,956
If you gave me this,

679
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,751
I can bail you out on self-defense.

680
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,171
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u is a tough man.

681
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:04,050
But I, Park Geun-tae,
made him cancel the indictment.

682
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,720
On top of that, he was recently shot down
in a self-defense case,

683
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,222
so he's completely pissed,
it won't be easy.

684
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,611
Prosecutor Jin has his eyes
on these two photos.

685
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,909
If the way Lee Man-ho was stabbed
looks similar to this one,

686
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,536
could your case really be ruled
as self-defense?

687
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:38,626
I defended Lee Man-ho up until his death,
so I'll appear as a testifier too.

688
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,088
I plan on making a strong case
that it wasn't self-defense.

689
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,547
My case

690
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,717
will be ruled self-defense for sure.

691
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,262
Gosh, you seem amazingly confident.

692
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,014
Who's your connection?

693
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,518
Someone who can consider
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u as his minion?

694
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,770
If that's the case, then I'll get lost.

695
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,773
Get lost, then.

696
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:03,984
Okay.

697
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,986
HAPPY CORRECTION, HAPPY PEOPLE

698
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,029
It's me.

699
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,449
Ki Du-seong is 100 percent sure
it'll be ruled as self-defense.

700
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,369
His connection thinks of Prosecutor Jin
as a minion,

701
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,913
so I think it's definitely
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

702
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,040
It looks like Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su
got him

703
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,000
Attorney Song Ki-joon of Hyeongseol.

704
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,169
Anyway, I'll share the details in person.

705
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,593
I'm sure Ko Hyeong-su made you rule
Ki Du-seong's case as self-defense.

706
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,350
You're a prosecutor,
so you shouldn't be treated as his minion.

707
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,199
The guest book from the funeral
on that day

708
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,534
where Ko and my uncle went.

709
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,871
They hadn't lost it.
It was with Mr. Shin Woo-seop's daughter.

710
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,207
His son-in-law went to med school
with Seung-jae.

711
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,962
It's the evidence that Seo and Ko
were at the funeral

712
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,213
on the day of the hit-and-run.

SEO BYUNG-JU, KO HYEONG-SU

716
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,403
But were they in the same car--

717
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,404
It can't prove that.

718
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,366
But why did Ko Hyeong-su fool you
and said he went the day before?

719
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,919
He may be your biggest connection
and the key presidential candidate.

SEO BYUNG-JU MURDER CASE

Let's go with self-defense.

727
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,347
If that's what Assemblyman Ko wants.

728
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,894
Gosh, you should've said so sooner.

729
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,730
I don't usually do everything
as people say.

730
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,315
I mean, it's Assemblyman Ko.

731
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,359
It was Assemblyman Ko…

732
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,030
so you did as he said?

AUNT

736
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,678
You should know by now
that your connection is finished.

737
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,147
AUNT

738
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,038
Do you have anything to tell me?

739
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,878
What did you want to hear from me
to call me out this late?

740
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,213
Nothing?

741
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,215
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

742
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,470
I'm sure you won't dare to interrogate me.

743
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,348
What more do I have to say between us?

744
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,808
We're in the same boat.

745
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,977
Just as you were in the same car with Seo

746
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,229
when he got drunk and hit someone and ran?

747
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,026
I don't know why you're doing this,

748
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,363
but you just have to trust me.

749
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,532
The rope I'm holding on to
should not be a rotten one, you know.

750
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,375
No, of course, it isn't!
What are you so worried about?

751
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,213
I have the law and the media
all in my hands.

752
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,021
Yang Jong-hoon, you lunatic.

753
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,025
How dare you shake Jin Hyeong-u

754
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,112
and get on my nerves?

755
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,742
Hey, that Kang Dan
or Erica Shin or whatever.

756
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,869
-Did you find her number?
-Yes, sir.

757
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,164
This is her number.

758
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,637
STAFF ONLY

759
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,309
Please head that way.

760
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,577
What's the prelim case?

761
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,578
CRIMINAL TRIAL

762
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,537
FEBRUARY 2021

763
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,415
CHARGED WITH DEFAMATION…

764
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,000
All right! A defamation case.

765
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,710
It's the only thing I'm good at.

766
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,297
This is freaking hard.

767
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,592
That's why I wanted to go
with a criminal case.

768
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,553
I want to be a prosecutor.
Why did I take up a civil case?

769
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:07,222
If we went with the criminal case,
we'd be against Joon-hwi.

770
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,475
Hey, so, what if we're against him?

771
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,851
I can win without you.

772
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,811
-Is that all you can say?
-Yes, it is.

773
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,440
Well, I'm scared of speaking
into microphones.

774
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,902
Why can't the main competition
be on paper like the prelims?

775
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,988
How will you stand in court
when you become a lawyer?

776
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,990
Overcome it with this.

777
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,328
Can we really do this in a week?

778
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,914
More time doesn't necessarily mean
a better performance,

779
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:32,915
but we need an award.

780
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,250
Then the president won't be as harsh.

781
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,377
You're right.
I put my faith in you, Ji-ho.

782
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,134
Anyway, why did Prof. Yang bring us here?
It's not a crime scene.

783
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,512
I have nothing else to say.

784
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,055
How were you bailed out?

785
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,643
The land value is high here,
so this café must have cost you a lot.

786
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,229
Something happened to a friend,

787
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,606
so he handed it over
at a very cheap price.

788
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,317
Was your friend a driver to Cho Tae-yeong?

789
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,071
Cho Tae-yeong,
the CEO of a toy company called I-bit.

790
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,117
I have to do something.

791
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,369
The day I came here…

792
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,046
you were at Lee Man-ho's place
with his anklet.

793
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,756
Where did Lee Man-ho go?

794
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,596
I have no idea, okay?

795
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,683
How the heck would I know
where he went and what he did?

796
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,476
Then how did you end up

797
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,979
giving me all these?

798
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,023
He was doing all kinds
of suspicious and weird stuff, so…

799
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,987
I already told the police
and the prosecution.

800
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,738
I'm grateful.

801
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,033
I was cleared of my false charge
thanks to you.

802
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,619
Then you shouldn't be here
obstructing my duty--

803
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,537
Your duty?

804
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,627
Don't people usually say
it's obstruction of business at a café?

805
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,757
What exactly is this duty
that we took you away from?

806
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,302
One more question.

807
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,513
The day we failed to see Ki Du-seong.

808
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,557
I don't know who it is.

809
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,268
BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

810
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,312
Oh, I know who it is.

811
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,316
Around 11 a.m. on December 15th,
who were you talking to?

812
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,865
December 15th at 11 a.m.

813
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,952
Check Choi Jae-cheol's call history.

814
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,590
INVESTIGATOR JUNG TAE-HUN

815
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,178
Did you find
Choi Jae-cheol's call history?

816
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:52,763
Send it to me.

817
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:01,063
DECEMBER 15TH, 2020,
11:00:13, SEOUL, 010-765-3395

818
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,065
3395.

819
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,941
AUNT

820
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,235
AUNT

821
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,528
3395.

822
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:10,989
Darn it!

823
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,282
FIRELOL: THIS IS SLANDER!

824
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,575
FIRELOL: I MUST EXPOSE HIM

825
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,787
HOT PINK CHILI: HIS SON IS A VICTIM
HOT PINK CHILI: NO WAY, KANG SOL

826
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,331
People with these IDs

827
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,459
are very friendly only for Ko and his son.

828
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,128
They must be his avid followers.

829
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,880
These politicians have fans.

830
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,507
He could be the next president.

831
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,176
What if it's manipulated,
disguised as fans?

832
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,969
Organized fake comments?

833
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,431
Ye-bum, can you upload that video?

834
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,810
KO APOLOGIZES IN TEARS,
BUT WITH FAKE TEARS?

835
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,312
My client, Prof. Kim Eun-suk,

836
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,564
decided to take her hands off
of the legislation

837
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,983
of the dating abuse law
with Assemblyman Ko.

838
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,986
She found out
Assemblyman Ko faked his tears

839
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,822
on the video of his public apology.

840
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,868
Darn it. Get it into my eyes, will you?

841
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,662
Get it in there.

842
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,914
Hey, put in some more.

843
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,624
-That's way too much.
-Some more.

844
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,127
I'll put this up.

845
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,171
You need to get here.

846
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,382
-Put it on the floor.
-Yes.

847
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,467
-What's with your handwriting?
-Stay still.

848
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,095
That's way too long.

849
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,014
When my client found out
he shed crocodile tears,

850
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,433
she felt shocked in betrayal

851
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,936
and decided to take her hands off
of the entire legislation process.

852
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,021
This is what Prof. Kim wanted.

853
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,023
PARK GEUN-TAE

854
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,902
Ko Hyeong-su and his son
have put on a huge act together.

855
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,946
Look at these comments.

856
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,451
You're right. These do seem suspicious.

857
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,870
Hey, look at the comments.

858
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,913
This one.

859
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,541
Look at how these IDs swarm in
as if they'd been waiting.

860
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,001
It's suspicious.

861
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,085
BUT HE WORKED SO HARD

862
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,379
They all show support for Ko and his son

863
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,630
but are criticizing us.

864
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,258
They're manipulating these comments.

865
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,802
Prof. Kim wanted to confirm this.

866
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,221
But this phenomenon
can't be used as direct evidence

867
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,390
to prove that Ko Hyeong-su is behind this.

868
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,976
And I think Prof. Yang came here
to find a lead.

869
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:03,977
Right here?

870
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,193
If you won't pick up, hang up.

871
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,696
If you won't hang up, pick it up.

872
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,914

Ko Hyeong-su isn't your fight.

879
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,564
What?

880
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:53,026
It's a piece of cake to destroy you.
Only you will get hurt.

881
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,572
So what? Did you--

882
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,116
What was that?

883
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,328
-Look at where you are.

884
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,830
It's staff only.

Can't you read?

886
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,167
It's not like I went in there.

887
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,378
What's in here?

888
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,214

PARK JUNG-GIL
MOLESTS HIS ADOPTED DAUGHTER

892
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,226
These are the fake news and comments

893
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,312
that drove Ko Hyeong-su's opponent
to death four years ago.

894
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,525
The IDs here are the same as the ones
who made comments on these videos.

895
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,444
Support for Ko,
but criticism for the opponent.

CAFÉ RITA COFFEE: 832-12 YEONSEO-RO

That café was built on the free land
my uncle got from Ko Hyeong-su.

904
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,976
He sold the land
to Cho Tae-yeong's driver,

905
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,895
but Cho actually owns it.

906
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,939
Why didn't you stay in the police academy?

907
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,904
Hey, Attorney Park.

908
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,406
What did you say?

909
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,700
Attorney Song of Hyeongseol sued me?

00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,475
Damn it, these evil jerks!

918
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,727
How can they go on a witch hunt
for everyone?

919
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,103
This is an act of terrorism.

920
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,314
This is considered murder, not defamation.

921
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,815
Stop reading those.

922
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,858
Forget about it.

923
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,778
We have no time to lose our mind
over some malicious comments.

924
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,905
We might end up dead first
before catching Ko.

925
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,990
The public is against us.

926
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,493
This is how he has maintained his power.

927
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,787
And my dad was one of his victims.

928
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,622
We must annihilate this manipulation.

929
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,915
Darn it!

930
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,501
We have to turn in our summary
of arguments in two days!

931
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,294
Close your ears for a second.

932
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,587

ERICA SHIN'S US LAW LECTURE

934
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,262
She's Kang Sol A's twin sister.

935
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,642
They look exactly alike,
but they're on two different levels.

936
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,727
A sexual scandal with Yangcrates?

937
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,646
I can't believe her.

938
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,236
Why would you come here?

939
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,071
Your sister will only lose her spirit.

940

ERICA SHIN'S US LAW LECTURE

941
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,536

00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,347
Everyone.

947
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,685
Hello.

948
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,689
Is Kang Sol here?

949
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,566
Are you Erica Shin?

950
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,194
Where's my sister?

951
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,824
She went to the library
to find some materials.

JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL IN 5 DAYS!

I'm Han Joon-hwi.

954
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,921
Did you make the statement
on the constitutionality?

955
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,632
Yes, I did that.

956
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:46,968
I enjoyed it.

957
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,932
I enjoyed your take
on how it's unconstitutional.

958
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,977
So you're my sister's roommate.

959
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,438
I heard
you two are teammates for a mock trial.

960
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:02,358
Yes. Your sister wrote it. Take a look.

961
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,210
I'm Prof. Kim's attorney, Park Geun-tae.

962
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:26,508
You filed a suit against my client,
Prof. Kim,

963
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:30,678
for slandering you in court
during the Bad FaMa trial.

964
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,349
Right, have you been paying
your child support?

965
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,687
Sorry. I just get very curious.

966
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,523
Aren't you?

967
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,151
I'll let you sue me all you want.

968
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,820
You wanted to tell me that?

969
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,196
No.

970
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,950
I wanted to tell you
not to drop your suit.

971
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,960
Write a note that you won't drop it,
then we'll have it notarized.

972
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,925
You seem a bit worn out.

973
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,012
That figures.

974
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,514
You were framed for murder,

975
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,601
then you got involved
in a sex scandal with a student.

976
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,396
My gosh, Professor Yang.

977
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:29,028
I mean, I've gotten used to dealing
with absurd rumors like that.

978
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,530
Why did you want to see me?

979
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,657
It's not that I wanted to see you.

980
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,823
POWER OFF

981
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,702
POWER OFF

982
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,510
It has been so long.

983
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,262
I wondered why you're Erica Shin

984
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,848
then found out you went to the U.S.,
to your birth father.

985
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,767
He's barely a father.

986
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,936
That married man had an affair with my mom

987
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,897
then emigrated before he found out
he got her pregnant.

988
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,191
But he still gave you a different life.

989
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,110
He's better than that scumbag stepdad.

990
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,197
Just cut to the chase
and tell me why the three of us are here.

991
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,323
Let me tell you that.

992
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,492
I asked for you, prosecutor…

993
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,912
I mean, professor,
I asked him to have you here.

994
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,546
You must have another phone.

995
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,089
I think someone's calling you.

996
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,843
Darn it.

997
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,431
I just need to check the CCTV.
Why can't I see it?

998
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,142
Well.

999
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,019
Hey, well.

1000
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,981
If you won't let me see it,
I'll have to call the police.

1001
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,774
It's a really important flash drive.

1002
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,234
It's not that I don't want to.

1003
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,861
It'll get more hectic with the police,
so just show us!

1004
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:35,863
Gosh.

1005
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,198
STAFF ONLY

1006
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,290
What do we do now?

1007
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,374

FOR LEASE

1015
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,103
Stop shaking my sister around.

1016
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,024
Let her focus on her studies
and graduate law school.

1017
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,026
I don't want her to be involved with you

1018
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,945
only to become a nuisance
for Assemblyman Ko.

1019
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,205
Please ask Sol
to delete the video yourself.

1020
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,540
What if I say no?

1021
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,709
Then I'll upload a video myself

1022
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:15,254
that my accusation of Mr. Ko
was a misunderstanding and a mistake,

1023
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,548
that the letter was all fake.

1024
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,263
Now that she lives in a bigger world,

1025
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,684
she finally got a grasp
on how the world works.

1026
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,938
There was no violation
of the Election Act.

1027
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,025
Why are you taking it this far?

1028
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,029
She went to a juvenile hall because of me.

1029
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,450
And that led to her involvement
in a scandal with you.

1030
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,661
I can't let her get hurt because of me.

1031
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,331
There's no reason for me to stay here.

1032
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,634
Delete her photos from the juvenile hall.

1033
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,640
Delete all malicious comments
on my sister as you promised.

1034
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,725
And the sex scandal.

1035
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,271
Bring everything back to its place.

1036
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:20,570
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

1037
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,321
Do it.

1038
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,198
No way. We can't do that.

1039
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,534
If we only delete her comments,
it'll be obvious.

1040
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,288
Hey, do as you're told.

1041
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,123
Do you want to end up like Lee?

1042
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,043
Fine, I'll do as I'm told.

1043
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,547
Okay, we've been told what to do.
So let's do it.

1044
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,548
Okay.

1045
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,595
DELETE, EDIT

1046
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,638
DELETE, EDIT

1047
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,726

1048
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:52,852

EXPOSING ASSEMBLYMAN KO

1051

THERE'S EVIDENCE! IT GOT COVERED?

1052
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,244
How amazing.

1053
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,000
What are you all doing?

1054
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,462
You're all under arrest
for manipulating online comments.

1055
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,005
-Cuff them.
-Yes, sir.

1056
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,757
-Hey, don't move.
-Freeze.

1057
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,966
-Stop everything.
-Hands.

1058
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,010
-Keep your hands there.
-What's going on?

1059
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,136
-Freeze.
-Okay.

1060
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,638
-Be gentle.
-Don't make a move.

1061
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,972
I'll walk myself. Let go.

1062
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,183
We should consider fake news

1063
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,436
as a part of our free speech.

1064
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,564
Kang Dan,
you became a success as Erica Shin

1065
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,359
all thanks to me, right?

1066
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,490
I hope Yang Jong-hoon remembers that.

1067
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,743
I will remember that.

1068

01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,420
-We'll begin our search and seizure.
-What is this?

1071
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:11,305
All right, now.
I'm Park Geun-tae, an attorney.

1072
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,683
Give me a call if this seems unfair.

1073
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,893
Call me, okay? Goodness.

1074
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,354
Here, take one.
You know me. I'm Park Geun-tae.

1075
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,730
RECENT CALLS

1076
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,190
Here you are.

Park Geun-tae, an attorney.

1078
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,111
INCOMING CALL

1079
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,781
-Hello?
-Detective Jang?

1080
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,452
Kang Dan, you.

1081
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,413
You'll have to pay for this!

1082
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,664
Right.

1083
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:40,001
Ms. Kang Dan's appendix burst,
so she never got on the plane.

1084
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:41,878
What?

1085
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,390
We're in the same boat, you know?

1086
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,851
Are you telling me to destroy evidence?

1087
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,604
Do you think I'll crumble down like this?

1088
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,688
What?

1089
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,024
These are all circumstantial evidence.

1090
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,651
We need his confession.

1091
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,777
There is a way.

1092
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,779
Ko Hyeong-su doesn't trust anyone easily.

1093
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,573
People like Ko may have allies,
but they have many enemies, too.

1094
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,117
I'll represent you, as you wanted.

1095
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,243
Are you sure though?

1096
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,662
The law…

1097
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,164
It'll punish Ko Hyeong-su
for what he did, right?

1098
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,461
