1
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,274
-Damn you…
-Hey, you!

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,236
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,614
You can't do this to me!

4
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,698
Let go…

5
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,286
That's not enough to kill him.

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,287
Damn it.

7
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,124
Choke him harder!

8
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,836
COURT

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,880
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

10
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,429
Is the defense counsel not here yet?

11
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,973
ACCUSED

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,855
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

13
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,528
Don't come closer.

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,740
Kill him!

15
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,372
Get that out of my face.

16
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,998
I said, get it out of my face!

17
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,958
Come on!

18
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,836
Finish him up and rot in jail
until you die…

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,129
as a murderer.

20
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,338
Get lost!

21
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,508
Professor Yang.

22
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,218
-Damn it!
-Hey.

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,387
What? Hey!

24
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,360
Had he actually killed me,

25
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,697
you would've been charged
for incitement to murder as well.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,323
Incitement to murder?

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,951
I showed you that
he has no intention of killing you.

28
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,913
Would he kill someone
wearing a GPS ankle bracelet?

29
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,040
He wouldn't.

30
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,460
He does not want to go back to jail.

31
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,839
Delete that.

32
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,757
About the medical certificate.

33
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,803
The one that says there's a slim chance
your son's right arm and leg will recover.

34
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,513
What about it?

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,515
You and the hospital president are close.

36
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,436
Did you ask him to write it like that
to screw my client over?

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,397
Although he can recover
with physical rehabilitation.

38
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,276
That's right.
That's who you're dealing with here.

39
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,322
So cut the self-defense crap.

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,742
If that stupid girl says
she will gladly accept her punishment,

41
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll, at least, spare her
from a harsh sentence.

42
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
Shit.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,647
Width, 13cm. Length, 30cm.
They're for a shoe size of 275mm.

44
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,067
Size 275mm.

45
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
Hey.

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,614
Why would you catch me?

47
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,283
Because I want to ask you something.

48
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,661
I've been meaning to visit you.

49
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,915
This.

50
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,086
It's my uncle's.

51
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,547
But someone did this.

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,468
My daughter did as her mom said.

53
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,933
What about it?

54
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,977
What you want to ask is "How."

55
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,312
Isn't that what you want to know?

56
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,231
How this ended up in my hands.

57
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
Prof. Yang gave it to me.

58
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,570
He said it was my uncle's.

59
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,912
Catch you later.

60
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,253
They're tracking you anyway.

61
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,713
See you at the police station.

62
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,222
Witness.

63
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,849
COURT

64
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,102
You went to the hospital
upon receiving the defendant's call.

65
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,979
Yes, the emergency room.

66
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,024
Who was with the defendant at the time?

67
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,358
Han Joon-hwi was with her.

68
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,693
JUROR

69
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,945
Just Han Joon-hwi and no one else?

70
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,447
Correct.

71
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,325
Did they seem pretty close?

72
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,785
I thought they were dating.

73
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,454
He was very protective of her.

74
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,291
No further questions.

75
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,542
COURT

76
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,712
JUROR

77
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,424
Counsel, you may cross-examine
the witness.

78
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,259
No questions, Your Honor.

79
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,428
JUROR

80
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,307
-No questions?
-Correct.

81
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,476
PROSECUTION

82
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,728
How come he's not asking anything?

83
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,733
NOVEMBER 9, 2020

84
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,861
PERSONAL INFORMATION

85
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,113
NOVEMBER 9, 2020, 20:15
MESSAGE FROM MY HUBBY

86
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,083
I'll go testify.

87
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,348
JUROR

88
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,977
I won't show the photos on the screen

89
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,439
because they'll remind the defendant
of the painful memories.

90
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,026
EVIDENCE FOR ASSAULT

91
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,073
Witness, you're the doctor
who issued her this medical certificate.

92
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,658
Correct.

93
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,577
Were these bruises caused by being beaten?

94
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,787
Yes, that is correct.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,330
How badly was she beaten?

96
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,209
Worse than this?

97
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,002
Yes.

98
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,796
PROSECUTION

99
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,589
JUROR

100
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,053
Someone kicked me,
and it was very painful.

101
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,681
I can't imagine how painful
that must've been.

102
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,893
LEFT SHOULDER, LEFT EYE, LEFT WRIST

103
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,939
-Objection.
-Can you imagine the pain?

104
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,733
Do you have evidence to prove
that Mr. Ko hit her?

105
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,485
Do you have evidence to refute it?

106
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,030
Up until the medical certificate
was issued, she was always with him.

107
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,367
The text messages and the photos here
prove that.

108
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,330
But none of them states or shows
that he physically assaulted her.

109
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,916
We can't assume he assaulted her
just based on the fact

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,085
that she was with him
before seeing the doctor.

111
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,838
What if she saw no one else
before going to the doctor's?

112
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,923
JUROR

113
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,388
Did she have company the first time
she visited your clinic?

114
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,764
Yes, she did.

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,807
Who was it?

116
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,393
From what I recall, it was her boyfriend.

117
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,314
"Boyfriend"? Are you referring
to Mr. Ko Yeong-chang, the victim?

118
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,192
I actually checked before coming here.

119
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,820
The name on the credit card
was Ko Yeong-chang.

120
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,280
I see.

121
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,533
What did Mr. Ko say to you that day?

122
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,744
He was very angry.

123
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,745
JUROR

124
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,289
He said his girlfriend was assaulted
by her stalker.

125
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,250
He asked for a medical certificate
proving bodily harm.

126
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,547
Knowing the assaulter could be prosecuted
even if the victim agreed to a settlement?

127
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,465
Yes.

128
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,176
How did the defendant react to that?

129
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,386
She didn't really say anything,

130
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,555
so I issued a certificate
proving bodily harm.

131
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,934
Did you, by any chance,
suspect that he might be the person

132
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,478
who assaulted her?

133
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,897
No, I never thought that.

134
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,857
Did you hear that?

135
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,946
Mr. Ko wasn't the assaulter
who caused her to go to the hospital.

136
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,449
In fact, he took her there
as her guardian.

137
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,409
MARCH 26, 2020

138
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,327
Get out.

139
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,455
A FEW MONTHS
BEFORE THE KO YEONG-CHANG INCIDENT

140
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,458
Ye-seul.

141
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,920
Let's get you treated
and get a medical certificate.

142
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,924
I'm a complete asshole if I do this again.

143
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,592
If this happens again,

144
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,137
use the medical certificate
and file charges against me.

145
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,807
Okay?

146
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,063
Let's go.

147
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,114
EVIDENCE FOR ASSAULT

148
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,740
Nonsense.

149
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,534
He took her there after hitting her.

150
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,744
Juror no. 4, please be quiet.

151
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,706
The jurors are not permitted to speak
during the trial.

152
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,749
If you have a question or anything to say,

153
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,544
please write it down and submit it.

154

JUROR INFORMATION: AN SUK-JA

155
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,842
HAS TWIN DAUGHTERS, KANG SOL AND KANG DAN

156
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,469
Looks like Juror no. 4
is on Ye-seul's side.

157
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,231
Weren't you aware that
the content of your post was defamatory?

158
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,483
I had no other option.

159
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,486
Had they paid child support
as they promised--

160
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,240
So you deliberately humiliated them
to force them into giving the money?

161
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,450
Is that it?

162
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,244
I want to ask them

163
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,666
why they're refusing to pay child support
for their own child.

164
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,252
-What brings you here?
-The kids did nothing wrong.

165
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,173
Our Legal Clinic is helping the defendant.

166
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,634
I see.

167
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,178
What about your son's trial?

168
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,933
I get that they hate me,
but why take it out on the kids?

169
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,692
Nonsense.

170
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,362
He took her there after hitting her.

171
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,700
I feel bad that Mom has to see this.

172
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,413
-No! Stay away from me!
-Open the door!

173
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,290
I said, open the door!

174
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,667
-Stop.
-Let go.

175
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,127
-Don't touch me.
-I'll kill him.

176
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,298
I told you to stop!

177
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,175
MENU

178
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,610
Why are you out here?

179
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,611
What?

180
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,114
You don't want to watch the trial?

181
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,240
I should watch it.

182
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,702
Because of Juror no. 4?

183
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,705
I thought she looked familiar.

184
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,916
I never forget a face.

185
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,554
Your Honor.

186
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,599
This witness examination will be focused
on how Mr. Ko sexually assaulted Ms. Jeon.

187
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,227
It will bring back the painful memories,

188
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,272
so please allow Ms. Jeon
to leave the courtroom for a moment.

189
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,358
This is an aggravated assault trial,
not sexual assault.

190
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,777
Which wouldn't have taken place
had it not been for

191
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,362
the sexual assault and the video.

192
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,822
COURT

193
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,159
Ms. Jeon should be protected
as a sexual assault victim.

194
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
This claim cannot be sustained.

195
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,497
We do not agree that the defendant
should be seen as a victim.

196
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,875

COURT

199
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,964
Witness.

200
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,842
You performed a rape kit
on Ms. Jeon, correct?

201
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,759
Yes.

202
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,636
Ms. Jeon.

203
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,099
If you're uncomfortable,
you may step out for a moment.

204
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,392

I'll just stay, Your Honor.

JUROR 2

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,903
Joon-hwi said Juror no. 2
will be a wild card.

209
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,738
But aren't you getting a bad feeling?

210
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,452
You've examined
a number of rape victims, right?

211
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,915
Yes, I'm usually the one
who handles it at our hospital.

212
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,458
The day Mr. Ko was injured,

213
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,836
the defendant was also brought
to the hospital and was examined by you.

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,754
Yes.

215
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,131
As an experienced medical professional,

216
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,510
do you believe that
she was raped by Mr. Ko?

217
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,594
JUROR NO. 2

218
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:27,389
First and foremost, Ms. Jeon

219
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,767
seemed very nervous
when I first examined her.

220
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,646
In the examination, I noticed a few things
that would not have occurred

221
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,940
had she willfully engaged
in consensual sex.

222
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,901
Such as defensive injuries that occurred
while struggling?

223
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,194
The question is leading.

224
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,616
What are these "few things"
you're referring to?

225
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,410
There were abrasions and bruises
on her arms and legs.

226
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,080
Mr. Ko's skin cells were found
under her fingernails,

227
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,667
and there were signs of genital
and vaginal trauma. Based on such--

228
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,962
Can't they happen
during a couple's sexual activities

229
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,965
that are sadistic or rough?

230
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,925
But normally--

231
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,802
Yes or no?

232
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,137
Yes.

233
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,559
Everyone has a different palate,
and the same goes for sexual taste.

234
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,310
That is true.

235
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,020
That's right.

236
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,149
They mutually decided to record themselves
on video while having sex.

237
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,612
So why claim that he raped her
and recorded the video secretly…

238
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,990
Oh, sorry.

239
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,868
Your bullshit made me choke.

240
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,119
COURT

241
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,416
Now, let's talk about whether or not
the video was secretly recorded.

242
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,294
In other countries,
failure to pay child support

243
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,589
could be considered child abuse
and may lead to criminal penalties.

244
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,633
It is a crime that threatens
the child's right to life.

245
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,220
Failure to pay child support
infringes on the child's right to life.

246
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,474
Therefore, it is different
from other financial obligations.

247
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,019
Their personal information was published,

248
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,897
but since they are threatening
their children's right to life,

249
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,732
they brought it upon themselves.

250
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,152
They should have the decency
to pay child support if they can afford

251
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,695
a lawsuit like this.

252
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,073
They're not deliberately withholding
payment. They don't have the money--

253
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,702
The website was created because
of bad parents who can pay it but don't.

254
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,913
PYO YEONG-IN

255
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,080
RESOLVED

256
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,624
Do you know who was here?

257
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,667
Why do you ask?

258
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,587
What?

259
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,007
RESOLVED

260
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,097
Even a lawyer at a big law firm
that everyone knows

261
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,809
refused to pay child support
for his two daughters

262
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,439
until the media got wind of the story
and sent 100 million won a few days ago.

263
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,818
If you don't believe me, you can go

264
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,488
to the other courtroom
where a jury trial is being held.

265
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,283
He is there now,
as the plaintiff's attorney.

266
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,120
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su
supports Bad FaMa.

267
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,375
But he hired Song,
the child support-evading lawyer

268
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,795
whose information was posted on Bad FaMa,
to represent his son.

269
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,926
HAEWON DAILY, REPORTER CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

270
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,769
I am covering this, but…

271
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,607
OBC REPORTER KIM HYEON-JAE

272
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,276
Hey, Kim.

273
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,654
I should've done an exclusive story
on this.

274
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,197
Where are you? Hurry.

275
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,032
What? You don't care?

276
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,006
COURTROOM 418

277
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,048
MY HUBBY

278
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,759
The prosecutor insists
it was recorded with consent,

279
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,261
so we'll call it "the video."

280
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,220
JUROR

281
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,764
The defendant received the video
from Mr. Ko

282
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,350
at 20:15 on November 9th.

283
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,853
November 9th, 20:15.

284
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,688
This is when she received it.

285
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,608
CAM01

286
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,070
MY HUBBY, 1 VIDEO

287
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,165
She was so shocked
that she fainted right away.

288
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,835
Did you know then that
it was a secretly recorded sex video?

289
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,253
I could only guess.

290
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,423
Ye-seul was panicking,
so I couldn't ask her.

291
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,883
WITNESS

292
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,470
If it was recorded with her consent
like the prosecutor is insisting,

293
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,389
would she have reacted that way
upon receiving it?

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,515
JUROR

295
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,227
-Because it was secretly recorded--
-We can't conclude that the reaction

296
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,481
was caused by the video
based on this footage alone.

297
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,611
Witness, you ran to the hospital
with Ms. Jeon on your back

298
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,030
when the ambulance could've taken her.

299
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,365
Yes.

300
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,535
And you were with her the whole time
she was at the hospital.

301
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,245
Yes.

302
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,498
I also heard you asked a friend

303
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,794
to check on the defendant's room
after the incident.

304
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,836
PROSECUTION

305
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
Yes.

306
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,672
That was to ensure they wouldn't think

307
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,175
that she might flee
or try to destroy evidence.

308
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,929
You were afraid she'd be detained
or arrested without a warrant.

309
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,181
That's why you went all out
to protect her.

310
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,353
Then based on that, wouldn't anyone assume
that they're very close?

311
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,898
I wanted to protect her from abuse.
If you think I went "all out"…

312
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,609
Sure, I did it to protect her.

313
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,697
I stopped Assemblyman Ko when he tried
to slap her in the face at the hospital.

314
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,453
But even if it was another friend,
I'd never let something like that happen.

315
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,454
JUROR

316
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,373
I'd never let a friend suffer injustice.

317
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,292
Here, what were you and Ms. Jeon
talking about?

318
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,546
Must I tell you everything?

319
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,549
Let me rephrase that
if you're uncomfortable answering it.

320
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,970
At the time, did you know
that she was planning to testify

321
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,054
in Mr. Yang's trial?

322
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,850
I was guessing she might.

323
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,560
So you didn't know for sure.

324
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,314
Earlier, you said you had guessed
it might be a secretly recorded video.

325
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,567
That means you didn't know for sure.

326
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,945
I guess not.

327
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,904
COURT

328
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,032
As a law student,
shouldn't you have refrained

329
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,452
from testifying if it was something
you weren't sure about?

330
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,707
It could incite the jurors
to jump to conclusions.

331
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
You're right.

332
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,547
If I taught criminal law
at Hankuk University,

333
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,842
I'd teach such basics first.
He didn't teach you this?

334
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,225
The way the two of you
exchanged glances just now

335
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,603
makes me think that you two
must be very close.

336
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,689
I'd like you all to remember this.

337
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,232
JUROR

338
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,735
There, what did you give her?

339
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,989
A pledge.

340
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:03,076
Mr. Ko signed a pledge that he'd never
sneak into her room again.

341
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,537
Why is it that you got it from Mr. Ko?

342
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,540
You said you and Ms. Jeon
are just friends.

343
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,879
-That's--
-What did you say when you handed it over?

344
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,132
"You should listen to Prof. Yang,
not Yeong-chang.

345
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,801
You must listen to your professor
to survive law school."

346
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,387
If Ms. Jeon, who was taken aback
by that remark…

347
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,472
CAN WE MEET NOW?

348
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,684
…happened to see this text message
from Mr. Yang, her professor,

349
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,103
she must've been terrified, right?

350
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,193
That is why she dropped her phone
and panicked.

351
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,110
JUROR

352
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,322
-Objection, Your Honor--
-Really?

353
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,158
I thought you'd say "No objection"
or "No questions" again.

354
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
Why did you ask her to meet up
at that late hour?

355
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,999
Why did he want to see his student
who was going to testify against him?

356
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,628
After this, Ms. Jeon changed her mind.

357
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,798
So to thank her,
you volunteered to represent her.

358
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,467
Isn't that why you're here?

359
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,970
JUROR

360
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,638
JUROR

361
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,644
Excuse me.

362
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,062
JUROR 4

363
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,105
The restroom…

364
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,359
We were all totally focused.
Must you interrupt the flow like this?

365
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,070
We don't have time.
Can't we just continue?

366
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,114
Could you wait?

367
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
No…

368
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,870
COURT

369
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,039
We'll take a 30-minute recess.

370
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,880
WITNESS, JUROR

371
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,260
JUROR

372
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,179
I had a bad hunch when I heard her name,
Bae Sim-won.

373
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,181
She'll be a hard one to beat.

374
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,599
The jurors seem persuaded.

375
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,894
Don't we need a forensic investigation
to prove what Ye-seul saw

376
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,105
in the lobby was indeed the spy cam video?

377
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,524
Hey, you. Why are you here?

378
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,234
What? Why?

379
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,570
Come with me.

380
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,238
Come on. Quick.

381
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,449
Come here. Listen.

382
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,743
Go to Mirinae Middle School.

383
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,329
Pick up this kid
and take him to his academy.

384
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,747
What?

385
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,249
Go. He's a school violence assailant.
I must get him.

386
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,376
Shouldn't the police catch him?

387
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,254
We don't need to "catch" him.
I just want the case.

388
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,007
I can charge a lot
for school violence cases.

389
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,924
Oh, I see.

390
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,886
His mother said she'll hire us
if we help her with this.

391
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,804
Hey, get going.

392
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,848
Now? Ye-seul's trial isn't over yet.

393
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,350
Hey, this is part of your internship.

394
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,810
Hurry.

395
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,354
-But…
-Hurry, go!

396
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,190
Drive safely, okay?

397
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,358
But…

398
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,365
KO HYEONG-SU SUPPORTS BAD FAMA

399
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,077
So many people have read this
and commented on it.

400
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,828
Thanks to you, Choi scored big.

401
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,997
All the other reporters wasted their time.

402
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,916
He acted as though he wouldn't cover it.

403
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,959
I told you he would, 100 percent.

404
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,962
We have the recording,
so he can no longer use Prosecutor Jin.

405
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,256
Thank God the police think
he should be indicted.

406
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,135
I told you that they would.
They had to, because of the recording.

407
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,096
Prosecutors are the problem.

408
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,680
They'll defend their colleague.

409
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,432
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

410
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,394
At the moment, you're one of us.

411
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,153
You're interning under my supervision.

412
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,411
I take my ramyeon very seriously.

413
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,956
You can drink the broth.

414
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,625
KO HYEONG-SU SUPPORTS BAD FAMA

415
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,671
Kiddos, stop trying to mess with me.

416
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,634
They say,
"Once a family, always a family."

417
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,136
So I'll let him off this once.

418
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,263
But you will be hurt.

419
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,767
If you keep messing with me,
you'll regret it big time.

420
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,731
It was 275.

421
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,069
Not 270.

422
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,281
The shoe size of the real culprit.

423
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,036
Since you're my supervisor now,
let's catch the killer together.

424
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,874
It'd be embarrassing for the prosecution
to bark up the wrong tree.

425
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,753
Have some rice with the broth
that I left for you.

426
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,965
Shouldn't you be suspicious of it by now?

427
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,642
The needle mark on his stomach
that wasn't from an insulin injection.

428
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,352
Being stabbed

429
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,565
with this needle right here
would puncture the stomach, right?

430
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,484
Yes, it would.

431
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,239
I'm under a lot of stress
because of my trial.

432
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,616
Please don't visit me again.

433
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,368
Did you see a puncture wound
in his stomach?

434
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,332
No, not during my examination.

435
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,834
It was already quite damaged
from the first autopsy.

436
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,462
What exactly do you mean?

437
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,968
Because of you, I was nearly convicted
of murdering my own uncle.

438
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,847
Please tell me the truth.

439
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,188
I think I heard someone talking about
a puncture wound in the stomach

440
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,815
when I went in there briefly
during the first autopsy.

441
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,069
That is not true. He just gave you
the answer that you wanted.

442
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,195
And to get that answer,

443
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,822
-you said you'd file a petition for him.
-A petition?

444
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,034
If the victim files a petition
requesting leniency for him,

445
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,411
he may be let off with a fine
instead of probation.

446
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,039
To a mere civil servant
at the National Forensic Service,

447
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,874
that is a matter of livelihood.

448
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,588
To keep his job, he had no choice,
but to give you the answer you wanted.

449
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,973
Why not lash out at me if he's that angry?

450
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,433
Why did he have to treat me
as if I was invisible?

451
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,604
The thought of becoming a prosecutor

452
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,648
is scaring me
for the first time in my life.

453
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,656
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

454

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

455
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,414
Have you eaten…

456
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,791
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

457
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,254
Did he just flat out ignore you?

458
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,922
He wants nothing to do with you.

459
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:35,135
It's not like we wanted that conversation
to be recorded.

460
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,598
What's with that scoop?
You didn't even tell me.

461
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,808
What?

462
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,394
WORLD WITHOUT CORRUPTION

463
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,771
How can this be part of the internship?

464
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,400
I get that school violence cases
pay a lot, but I'm not his driver.

465
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,653
Lawyers bust their butt to get clients.
This is hands-on experience.

466
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,363
-I have to go.
-Hey, Bok-gi.

467
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,116
At least, Mr. Park gives you stuff to do.

468
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,201
Prosecutor Jin would only talk
to Joon-hwi.

469
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,870
To him, I'm practically invisible.

470
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,496
Want to be Mr. Park's driver then?

471
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,460
Why did I want to become a lawyer?
I'm fundamentally regretting my decision.

472
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,921
AT LEFT TURN SIGNAL
AT PEDESTRIAN CROSSING

473
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,637
I mean, Ye-seul' trial is taking place
right now.

474
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,639
I should be there.

475
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,558
I'll try to keep you in the loop.

476
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,941
Everything was going great
until the press conference, but…

477
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,526
NICE JOB, HAEWON DAILY

478
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,572
People were so supportive,
but they've suddenly gone cold.

479
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,410
Why did you have to ruin everything
for me?

480
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,872
What were you thinking
when you hired a jerk who refused

481
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,248
to pay child support?

482
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,797
Oh, don't get me wrong.

483
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,258
I only found out today
that he's representing your son.

484
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,643
Here are some precedents
that could be helpful for Ye-seul.

485
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,235
This one's very recent.

486
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,237
She said to the police
she didn't report it

487
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,988
because she feared retaliation,

488
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,449
but she told the prosecutor
that love was the reason.

489
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,993
Such inconsistency could put her
at a disadvantage.

490
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,663
You found a case where the court

491
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,165
ruled in favor of a rape victim
despite inconsistency.

492
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,168
This will be very useful.

493
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,343
Hello.

494
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,639
Going down.

495
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,059
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CONTEST

496
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,353
I heard you didn't get
the court internship.

497
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,563
Right.

498
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,065
Do you think it was because
of the plagiarism scandal?

499
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,817
About that…

500
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,861
I told Prof. Kim

501
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,531
that your conviction is dangerous.
You only see what you want to see.

502
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,117
That's not a fair statement
as I have a smoking gun.

503
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,121
Go public with it.

504
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,414
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CONTEST

505
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,957
That person doesn't want to,

506
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,419
so you can get another chance.

507
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,852
Attorney Song, this crazy idiot.

508
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,156
I can't believe

509
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,409
you withheld child support of all things.

510
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,702
Oh, that was…

511
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,413
I got it all resolved recently.

512
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,292
You're off the case as of this moment.

513
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,086
Sir.

514
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,933
I attended the Bad FaMa trial
to divert media attention,

515
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,145
but the reporters ended up flocking
to my son's trial because of you!

516
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,731
My apologies, sir.

517
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,567
Get lost.

518
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:24,197
Don't even loiter around the courtroom
for my son's trial.

519
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,411
There's an issue with the jurors.

520
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,289
The jurors?

521
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,177
Are you all right?

522
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,095
SOL

523
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,564
MOM
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

524
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,065
Why isn't she replying?

525
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,485
It's not like I can go talk to her.
This is frustrating.

526
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,081
Hey.

527
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,292
About last time…

528
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,796
Now, I know why you want to be
a prosecutor.

529
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,679
Your penetrating question got me
and my conscience.

530
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,700
Tell Prof. Yang I found out
what time Ye-seul first saw the video.

531
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,293
-My gosh.
-Hello.

532
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,502
Hello.

533
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,423
The trial seems to be going well,
thanks to Prof. Kim's testimony.

534
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,511
Even if I don't get acquitted, I want
to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

535
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,306
You helped me the most.

536
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,599
I didn't even do much.

537
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,686
If you are found guilty,
you can file an appeal.

538
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,066
But the prosecutor can do the same
even if I am found not guilty,

539
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,360
so I really hope they pass the bill.

540
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,278
The one Assemblyman Ko proposed today

541
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,698
for abolishing the current defamation law
for publicly alleging facts.

542
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,116
That bill is…

543
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,164
I promise you that I will fight with you
until the end.

544
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,959
-We got this.
-We got this.

545
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,837
Right, it'd be nice
if they passed that bill.

546
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,714
No.

547
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,133
But I refuse to support Ko Hyeong-su.

548
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,594
What?

549
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:55,056
I'm also against punishing those
who tell the truth

550
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,392
and think the defamation law
should be abolished.

551
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,853
But I'm really against Ko Hyeong-su
getting credit for it.

552
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,480
I can't let that happen.

553
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,440
So what's your point?

554
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,192
My point?

555
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,403
So I'm going to…

556
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,531
Why isn't she texting me back?

557
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,473

567
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,227
There she is.

568
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,897
Where's Prof. Yang?

569
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,024
-I thought you guys were with him.
-No.

570
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,944
Maybe he's pulling his hair out somewhere
because Prosecutor Bae got him good.

571
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,781
Based on the evidence so far,
it'll be difficult for Ye-seul

572
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,034
to prove that she was trying to stop him
from disseminating…

573
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:38,951
What?

574
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,162
COURT

575
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,673
We know when she first watched the video.

576
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,055
Are you going to have Seung-jae
testify for her?

577
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,735
I don't want to be on the witness stand.

DIGITAL FORENSICS REPORT

579
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,298
MESSAGE, INCOMING

580
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,676
DON'T FORGET THIS LONG NIGHT WE HAD
MY HUBBY

581
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,978
Are you saying you just helped Ms. Jeon
with her studies because you two

582
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:51,607
were in the same study group?
You're just friends and nothing more?

583
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,276
Correct.

584
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,320
In the group, there is someone
who I really want to look out for,

585
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,406
but it's not Ye-seul.

586
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,615
JUROR

587
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,286
It's someone in the study group?
Then the person must be here.

588
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,747
Everyone in the group is here
to help Ms. Jeon.

589
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,793
-Yes.
-Who is it?

590
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,799
Tell us who it is.

591
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:21,762
You can tell us unless this is a trick
to hide your relationship with Ms. Jeon.

592
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,913
Where is it?

593
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,248
How dare you touch my stuff?

594
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,958
I have no power, you see.

595
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,793
All I did was carry out the orders.

596
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,796
-Hey.
-Get lost!

597
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,674
Damn it!

598
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,594
Shit.

599
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,596
JIN HYEONG-U

600
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,306
Shit.

601
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,392
YANG JONG-HOON

602
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,977
Damn.

603
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,199
If your Bad FaMa client
is found not guilty,

604
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,701
you'll have me to thank for.

605
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,288
So I have to say I was pretty upset
when you brought up Attorney Song.

606
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,504
But I hope…

607
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,968
you're not going to break your promise
just because of that.

608
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,805
The promise you made
upon receiving the Lee Man-ho bill.

609
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,223
Of course, I won't.

610
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,725
I even got choked by him
while provoking him

611
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,519
with the recording that you had sent.

612
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,938
You must keep the promise

613
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,024
even if someone threatens you
with a knife.

614
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,401
Yes, of course.

615
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,987
As long as

616
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,116
Yang Jong-hoon isn't the one
holding the knife.

617
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,576
Don't drag me into his problem.

618
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,630
I have to go watch your son's trial.
Well, then.

619
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,676
-Shall we head out together?
-Go ahead.

620
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,597
Hey.

621
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,641
What?

622
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,991
JAMES

623
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,085
Ms. Jeon, you're studying law
to become a law professional.

624
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,211
Right?

625
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,713
WITNESS

626
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,672
Yes.

627
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,215
Then I'm sure

628
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,427
you were fully aware that filming someone
without their consent,

629
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,139
especially during sex,
is considered a serious criminal offense.

630
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:13,809
Yes.

631
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,562
If Mr. Ko physically abused you
and also filmed you

632
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,149
without your consent,
why didn't you report it to the police?

633
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:29,367
As someone who is studying to work in law,
why didn't she report such a crime?

634
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,537
Especially when she has a history

635
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,082
of filing a police report
against a college friend

636
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,501
who stalked her
before she started law school.

JUROR

638
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,758
What's going on?

639
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,259
-Who's that?
-Ko Yeong-chang!

640
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,302
-What?
-Mr. Ko.

641
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,929
-Ko Yeong-chang, right?
-Mr. Ko!

642
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,722
-Mr. Ko.
-Why is he here?

643
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,391
-Mr. Ko.
-Is it really him?

644
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,975
Mr. Ko, how are you feeling?

645
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,352
-Mr. Ko!
-Please step back.

646
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,311
Just a comment!

647
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,229
Please step back.

648
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,064
-What's going on?
-My apologies.

649
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,525
The victim wanted to be here,
so I brought him.

650
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,030
Prosecutor, please continue.

651
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,287
WITNESS

652
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,040
You can have some water before you answer.

653
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,130
According to your statement,

654
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,258
you didn't report him to the police
because you loved him.

655
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,218
Was that the reason?

656
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,432
You put up with the sexual assault
because you loved him?

657
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,977
That doesn't make much sense.

658
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:43,315
But if this statement is true,
you loved him enough to put up with it.

659
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,528
Then it's understandable
that you totally lost it and attacked him

660
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,281
the moment you heard him say
he wanted to end things.

661
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,493
-That is total baloney.
-That is total baloney.

662
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,328
Hoping he'd let you go unpunished

663
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,706
for the injuries you had inflicted
upon him,

664
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,501
are you now saying you were raped
though you actually had sex with him?

665
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,882
Her claim that she kept quiet out of love
is not true.

666
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,219
She had no reason to report him
in the first place

667
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,223
because Mr. Ko never assaulted her
in any way.

668
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,143
Defendant.

669
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,605
Calm down and return to your seat.

670
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,778
COURT

671
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,616
If you leave the courtroom now,
it may be used against you.

672
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,207
Please make that jerk leave the courtroom!

673
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,251
Juror no. 4, if you speak
without permission one more time,

674
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,587
-you'll be asked to leave.
-Tell her to leave now.

675
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,926
I request we take a recess.

676
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,093
Let's just continue.

677
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,222
JUROR

678
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,181
Your Honor.

679
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,808
COURT

680
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,979
I'd like to give Ye-seul what she wants.

681
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,899
Mr. Ko, I will give you a chance
to speak--

682
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,983
It's okay.

683
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,569
I have nothing to say.

684
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,864
Ye-seul and I were going to get married.

685
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,409
But just because she cheated on me
with a smarter guy at the law school

686
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,704
and let her professor threaten her
and toy with her,

687
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,668
I wanted to end things.
So it is my own fault.

688
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,839
I understand why she got so angry
and lashed out at me.

689
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,050
Your Honor.

690
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,428
Please just give her what she wants.

691
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,267
If she can be happy,

692
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,768
I'll gladly

693
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,022
be called a rapist.

694
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,526
Jeez, that douchebag is really something.

695
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,527
JUROR

696
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,737
Half of my body is paralyzed now anyway,

697
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,365
so I don't care if people call me
a shameless criminal.

698
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:00,911
I just feel horrible, thinking about
what my father might have to go through

699
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,914
because of his stupid son
who was crazy about his girlfriend…

700
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,586
Hurry. Take him back to the hospital.

701
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,878
-What?
-Wait, hold on!

702
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,547
-Mr. Ko!
-Out of the way, please.

703
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,215
-Hurry.
-Just a comment, please!

704
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,717
-Mr. Ko!
-Just a comment!

705
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,718
-Mr. Ko!
-Wait!

706
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,761
-All right.
-Tell us about your condition!

707
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,804
Order.

708
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,722
-Wait!
-Mr. Ko!

709
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,266
-Just a comment, please!
-Wait, Mr. Ko!

710
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,976
-One moment!
-Mr. Ko, are you okay?

711
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,440
HOW DID THE REPORTER FIND OUT ABOUT THIS?

712
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,567
NICE JOB, HAEWON DAILY

713
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,447
-Wait!
-Just a moment!

714
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,198
-One moment!
-Are you okay?

715
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,658
Tell us about your condition.

716
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,076
-Wait! Stop!
-Who's that?

717
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,244
Ko Hyeong-su's son.

718
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,996
-Ko Hyeong-su?
-How are you feeling?

719
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,289
-What?
-How do you feel?

720
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,666
-Just a comment, please!
-Are you okay?

721
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,876
-Wait!
-Mr. Ko!

WITNESS

724
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,312
Prof. Kim.

725
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,735
I don't want to do this anymore.

726
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,588
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

727
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,925
I have to say, provoking Assemblyman Ko
helped me score big.

728
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,802
If you want something bigger…

729
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,392
What's this?

730
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,437
Give a statement to the prosecutor.

731
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,522
Now?

732
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,358
-If you hand over that photo.
-After you give

733
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,818
-your statement.
-Hey.

734
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,780
He's pissed you're scoring all the scoops.

735
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,573
Where are you going?

736
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,325
All scoops are exclusive.

737
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,702
So first, let's--

738
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,704
Then Reporter Kim can score them all.

739
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,123
Mr. Kim.

740
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,250
It's nothing. Hey, let's talk.

741
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,422
JUROR

742
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,800
Counsel, you may continue
to examine the defendant.

743
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,931
DEFENSE COUNSEL

744
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,599
I am afraid

745
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,060
I can no longer represent Ms. Jeon.

746
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,356
JUROR

747
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,610
What's going on?

748
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,820
I beg your pardon?

749
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,405
PROSECUTION

750
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,533
I resign.

751
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,953
Counsel.

752
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,997
What is this about?

753
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,040
Is this some kind of joke?

754
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,919
You requested to be Ms. Jeon's
special defense counsel.

755
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,296
I apologize, Your Honor.

756
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:02,217
I wish to stop defending her
so that she can exercise

757
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,888
her right to defend herself.

758
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,056
Prof. Yang.

COURT

760
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,860
Am I your teacher?

761
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,363
What are you doing?

762
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,657
We'll begin.

763
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,329
Case number 2020-GH311.

764
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,414
Ms. Jeon and Mr. Ko
were in a relationship.

765
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,250
Jeon was indicted for inflicting
serious injuries on Ko

766
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,045
during their heated argument
about a video of their sex.

767
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,089
However, Jeon insists that
she acted in self-defense

768
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,967
while trying to stop Ko
from disseminating the video.

769
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,385
What is the main issue here?

770
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,762
PROSECUTION

771
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,391
What is the main issue?

772
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,524
COURT

773
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,779
Depending on the results of our trials,

774
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,322
this could be our last class.

775
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,116
So I expect your full participation.

776
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,539
WITNESS

777
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,207
The main issue…

778
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,502
JUROR

779
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,879
It's whether or not the video

780
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,757
was recorded secretly.

781
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,300
-That's it?
-Pardon me?

782
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,136
Is that enough for her to claim
she acted in self-defense?

783
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,934
Also whether he tried
to disseminate the video…

784
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,852
Why do the prosecutors disagree?

785
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,396
PROSECUTION

786
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,316
-After watching the video, I--
-Ms. Jeon.

787
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,194
She didn't get angry at him…

788
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:49,366
She neither got angry at Ko
nor told him to delete the video.

789
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,367
JUROR

790
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,995
When he texted her and asked
if she had watched it,

791
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,124
she wrote back "yeah" instead of "yes".

792
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,962
-Did you watch it?
-Yeah.

793
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,798
What's wrong with writing "yeah"
instead of "yes"?

794
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,593
That's…

795
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,470
"Yeah" connotes closeness.

796
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:14,850
It's not a reaction expected from someone
who's shocked after watching such a video.

797
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,811
TEXT CONVERSATION

798
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,730
At the Training Institute,

799
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,858
one of my peers asked me out.

800
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,277
I rejected her,

801
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,988
but she acted as if
we were even closer than before.

802
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,867
I was quite puzzled by her reaction.

803
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,578
I flat out rejected her,
so she must've been shocked.

804
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,996
Why didn't she get angry--

805
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,833
Not everyone gets angry when they're
shocked or when their pride is hurt.

806
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,836
Unless she was going to cut ties with him,
getting angry at him--

807
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,881
I see.

808
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,009
PROSECUTION

809
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,887
Another reason they think the video
wasn't recorded secretly?

810
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,891
I…

811
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,063
Because Jeon's statements
weren't consistent.

812
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,314
They weren't consistent?

813
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,398
WITNESS

814
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,527
Initially, she said it was because
she feared retaliation.

815
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,697
But then, she said it was because
she loved Ko.

816
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,117
The lack of consistency means
she wasn't raped and knew about the video?

817
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,661
I see.

818
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,371
Do you agree?

819
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,126
Did you not do your assignment again?

820
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,504
I told you to read up on the precedents.

821
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,924
ONE HOUR AGO

822
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,467
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES

823
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,684
The Supreme Court
recently quashed the acquittal

824
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,520
of a sexual assault assailant,

825
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,939
granted due to the victim's
inconsistent statements.

826
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,607
Why was it quashed?

827
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,860
Because a little bit of inconsistency
does not mean

828
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,321
her arguments and their credibility
can be nullified.

829
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:55,534
And the victim's extraordinary
circumstances weren't considered--

830
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,912
Then what are Jeon's extraordinary
circumstances in this case?

831
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,460
-What are her extraordinary circumstances?
-The fact that…

832
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,425
she was raped by the man
she was engaged to and loved.

833
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,513
So intimate partner rape is different
from other types of sexual assault.

834
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,472
How's it different?

835
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,226
Open your eyes!

836
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,106
Tell me how it's different.

837
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,821
If it was a complete stranger,

838
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,325
I'd think of it as a terrible nightmare
and shake it off.

839
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,748
But it was my boyfriend, who was part
of the rosy future I had dreamed of.

840

JUROR

841
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,919
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT

842
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,849
After watching the video,
Jeon was shocked and started to panic.

843
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,352
But she felt that she had to text him
"yeah" as usual,

844
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,854
because had she not replied,

845
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,108
he would've called her hundreds of times.
And he would've…

846
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,276
JUROR

847
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,280

TEXT CONVERSATION

849
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,328
She was confused whether it was love,
or he was just abusing her.

850
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,246
JUROR

851
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,791
So she probably didn't even know
how to react to it.

852
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,674
Ye-seul, how dare you?

853
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,386
You've become awfully arrogant
since getting into Hankuk Law.

854
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,723
Let go. Don't do this.

855
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,142
How did you get this?

856
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,229
This angle is way better than
that of Ko Yeong-chang's dashcam.

857
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,105
He can't refute this.

858
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,149
He wanted to disseminate it,
not delete it.

859
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,984
How long have you had this?

860
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,028
Don't ask me
why I didn't share this sooner.

THE DAY OF THE KO YEONG-CHANG INCIDENT

862
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,761
Professor, you were wrong.

863
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,101
I wanted to kill him.

864
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,270
When I found out about the video

865
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,440
and was threatened
that he'd disseminate it…

866
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,570
I wanted to hit that jerk with this
and pummel him to death.

867
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,697
JUROR

868
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,157
I was wrong indeed.

869
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,951
I didn't report it to the police because…

870
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,372
I couldn't even bear the thought
of telling someone about it.

871
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,961
I was

872
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,048
raped by the man I loved.

873
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,845
But you forced yourself to tell others.

PROSECUTION

879
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,398
Because they'll be asked these questions.

880
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,027
"You'll file charges
against your boyfriend?

00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,029
Are you sure you were sexually assaulted?"

882
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,074
-Objection--
-That is not allowed in my class.

00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,483
"What did I do wrong

PROSECUTION

892
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:14,519
While trying to protect herself
from the horrendous situation

893
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,147
of the sex video
being widely disseminated,

894
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:21,192
she unintentionally caused injury to Ko
by pushing him.

895
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,987
Based on the Criminal Code Article 21,

896
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,365
this was an act performed
to prevent unjust infringement.

897
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,118
ARTICLE 21 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE
- SELF-DEFENSE

898
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,162
So I'd conclude she acted in self-defense.

I helped my uncle
when he was working on it.

913
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,726
It can only be ruled self-defense

00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,729
performed in order to prevent impending

JUROR

917
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,868
If he punches me
after getting kicked in the shin,

918
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,122
it's considered mutual combat
and won't be ruled self-defense.

919
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:04,087
If he tries to defend himself
as I'm attacking him like this,

920
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,964
it'll be ruled self-defense.

921
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,674
Let's look at the screen.

922
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,973
Here. The phone fell on the ground.

923
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:18,143
Ye-seul kicked him after that,
wearing her high heels.

924
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,853
Oh, you're right.

925
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,147
Ko dropped his phone, which means,

926
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,151
he couldn't disseminate it at the time,
so she should've stopped attacking him.

927
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,152
No.

928
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,238
She was panicking.
What if she didn't see him drop his phone?

929
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,658
-I mean, it was dark.
-Did you know he dropped his phone?

930
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,705
We'll consider
all extenuating circumstances.

931
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,125
You knew about his phone,
but kicked him wearing the heels

932
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,960
because you were so angry, right?

933
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,634
You kicked him knowing that his phone
had fallen on the ground, didn't you?

934
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,803
You said this earlier.

935
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,348
"I wanted to hit that jerk with this
and pummel him to death."

936
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,312
She should say no even if she knew.
That's what I'd do.

937
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,022
Ko is the bad guy here.

938
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,523
I'd save myself.

939
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,860
You kicked him even though you knew
that his phone had fallen

940
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,112
on the ground, right?

941
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,074
Yes.

942
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,081
For this to be ruled self-defense,

943
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,084
the defendant should've stopped
attacking him

944
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,462
the moment Mr. Ko's phone
slipped out of his hand.

945
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,675
But as she admitted just now--

946
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,676
Are you blind?

947
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,094
Look at that.

948
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,265
She did it because she was afraid
that jerk would pick up his phone.

WITNESS

953
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,775
I don't think I can say no

954
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,818
if I knew about it.

955
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:55,406
But I probably would've done
exactly what Ye-seul did.

956
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,408
Out of fear that he'd pick up his phone.

957
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,868
I think that's what happened.

958
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,704
In other words,
the unjust infringement continued.

959
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,289
He didn't actually pick it up.

960
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,835
If he tried to pick it up, we cannot say
the unjust infringement continued.

961
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,178
Say that again.

962
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,222
They proved his attempt to disseminate it.

963
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,683
Depending on whether or not
it's ruled self-defense--

964
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,477
Damn, that idiot Jin Hyeong-u!
What has he been doing?

965
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,605
-I even went there and put on a show--
-Shut up!

966
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,362
-Tell Prosecutor Jin
-Yes, sir.

967
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,322
to do whatever it takes

968
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,535
to get Juror no. 4 kicked out
before the jurors' discussion begins.

969
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,746
Thankfully, Juror no. 4
is an alternate juror.

970
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,126
I see.

971
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:53,590
I'll take a quick shower
and return before the discussion is over.

972
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,841
Okay.

973
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,928
I sent the photo to Choi after confirming
that he gave his statement.

974
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,430
He wrote an article right away.

975
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,140
Okay.

976
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,224
KO HYEONG-SU ATTACKED

977
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,934
ATTACKED BY LEE MAN-HO

978
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:13,610
Assemblyman Ko wants to get Lee Man-ho
locked up for attempted murder.

979
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,819
I'd appreciate that.

980
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,821
So I won't have to check this.

981
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,783
Give it to my roomie
you want to look out for.

982
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,912
What? Are you disappointed
that it's not you?

983
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:29,000
Well, that makes me want
to look out for you, too.

984
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,010
Byeol is home alone.

985
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,056
Right, alternate jurors also have to stay
until the end.

986
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,974
MILL

987
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,851
Hold on.

988
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,817
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

989
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,163
You somehow managed to win
Reporter Choi over.

990
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,544
You think you can use this
to bring me to trial?

991
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,629
You will be indicted.

992
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,965
You want to clear your father's name
by making me a defendant?

993
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,761
I told you to stop messing with me.
You just can't take hints.

994
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,390
Why do you think I sat in on this trial?

995
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,237
What you see isn't everything.

996
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,241
But then again, how would you know
the substantial truth

997
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,535
that even your father didn't know
until he died?

998
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,670
You need to learn about it
if you want to work in law.

999
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,298
Am I wrong?

1000
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,354
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

1001
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,481
Did you read the article about Lee Man-ho?

1002
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,859
Where is he now?

1003
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,778
He hasn't stepped out of his house
since the article came out.

1004
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,363
EUNPYEONG-GU

1005
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,865
LEE MAN-HO

1006
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:29,078
Please call me
if you notice anything unusual.

1007
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,804
KO HYEONG-SU ATTACKED

1008
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,983
I gave you my blood to save your life.

1009
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,611
You can't do this to me.

1010
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,689
The real culprit is caught.

1011
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,527
As if it was not enough to dig up
Ko's back. You didn't bribe them, did you?

1012
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,695
It won't be acknowledged as self-defense.

1013
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,490
It means Lee Man-ho is the real culprit.

1014
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,992
Tell that jerk Choi
to walk back his remarks

1015
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,787
and make it
look like you caught the culprit.

1016
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,039
I don't think I can work for you anymore.

1017
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,416
Did you really kill Seo Byung-ju?

1018
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,210
But Lee Man-ho…

1019
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,006
