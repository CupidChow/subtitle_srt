1
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,689
Why are you going home alone?

2
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,191
I told you to go with friends.

3
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,818
They're all at the academies.

4
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,779
I'm the only one who can't…

5
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,988
No one else is free.

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,992
Hang in there.

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,911
I'll make lots of money once I graduate

8
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,455
and hire the best tutor for you.

9
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,665
I heard even lawyers struggle these days.

10
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,293
Your grades aren't good enough
to join a famous law firm.

11
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,252
What do you mean…

12
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,880
You little brat. You're too smart.

13
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,466
Hey, I told you
not to use your phone too much.

14
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,509
I'll take it away.

15
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,260
Who says you can? It's Dan's.

16
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,972
Anyway, Lee Man-ho is really scary.
You have to be careful.

17
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,390
You have the spray, right?

18
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,308
Yeah.

19
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,228
Don't worry about me. You should study.

20
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,774
But he actually looks very different
in person.

21
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,609
The kids may not recognize him.

22
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,779
He's so much uglier in person.
He's really creepy.

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,156
Okay.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,533
Study hard!

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,502
I'm uglier in person?

26
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,382
Hey, take a good look.

27
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,176
I don't think I'm that ugly.

28
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,642
Hey, do you carry that around
because of me?

29
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,769
Stay away, or I'll spray you.

30
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,856
Hey, kiddo. I'm not a scary person now.

31
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,484
I don't care what you say.
I am scared, so stay away.

32
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,028
You see, I read the laws
instead of the Bible

33
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,572
when I was in jail.

34
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,699
You could be charged with assault
if you use--

35
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,187
That day,

36
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,067
I brought the sugar packet.

37
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,573
I killed him.

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,368
Professor Seo Byung-ju.

39
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,297
You finally found me.

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,188
KANG SOL B

41
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,588
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

42
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,924
Why are you calling him?

43
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,385
You should've listened to Dad
and stopped yourself.

44
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,179
You made me plagiarize it
just to piss Dad off.

45
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,139
I did it for your sake, not mine.

46
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,309
What's with you?

47
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,520
It's not like he died because of…

48
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,899
That is not the case.

49
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,614
Why don't you study with your tutor?

50
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,741
I'll call your tutor now.

51
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,135
I'm the one
who got rid of the sugar packet

52
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,681
and stole the laptop.

53
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,351
It was all me.

54
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,943
To frame you.

55
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,994
I slipped the drug into his coffee.

56
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,414
So you saw him before I did.

57
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,625
And there were two packets of meth.

58
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,215
Let's talk sober.

59
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,763
I'm totally sober.

60
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,014
I was out of my mind--

61
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,515
Sounds like a drunken slur.

62
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,017
Let's talk another time.

63
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,646
Do you also think I'm a joke?

64
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,402
Do you think

65
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,697
I stayed here
because I didn't feel confident

66
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,783
that I'd pass the judicial exam?

67
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,386
Gosh, I see that he has opened the e-mail.

68
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,721
Give him some time.

69
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,225
Yeah? Gosh…

70
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,897
Hello?

71
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,149
Yes, speaking. I'm Byeol's sister.

72
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,444
What? What did you say?

73
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,076
The sex offender information
you received in the mail

74
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,995
cannot be shared like this
even if it's just a photo.

75
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,914
This is ridiculous.

76
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,291
My little sister sent it to her classmates

77
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,877
so they could all look out
for this rapist.

78
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,797
Still, you can't upload this
in a group chat.

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,632
We should beware of this ticking bomb.

80
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,925
Why is it against the law?

81
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,219
Why must I come here for this?

82
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,470
Jeez.

83
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,889
It's just the law.

84
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,932
Why yell at me?

85
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,351
You're studying law,

86
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,769
so you must know it well.

87
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,605
Yes, I'm well-versed in defamation law.

88
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,399
But I've never even heard of this.

89
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,775
It is there.

90
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,321
Article 55, Act on the Protection
of Children Against Sex Offenses.

91
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,866
PROHIBITION OF ABUSE
OF INFORMATION FOR DISCLOSURE

92
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,243
See? I told you.

93
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,619
You got this case?

94
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,456
Yeah, with my luck.
I don't want to deal with that scum.

95
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,876
This is insane. They're prioritizing
the rights of criminals

96
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,752
over children's safety?

97
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,381
Darn it!

98
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,259
Who are they trying to protect here?

99
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,721
Innocent civilians or evil criminals?

100
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,681
Join the National Assembly.

101
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,184
Actually, let's talk about this photo.

102
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,143
How old is this?

103
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,895
You've met Lee Man-ho.

104
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,104
He looks so different.

105
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,316
You wouldn't recognize him
even if he walked right past you.

106
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,776
-Right.
-Can you find a better photo to use

107
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,154
-before you catch people who have--
-Why don't you…

108
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,159
just tell your cute little sister
to take down that useless photo?

109
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,369
Gosh…

110
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,748
I have to say,
that pepper spray was intense.

111
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,833
The eye doctor said… Oh, boy.

112
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,503
I nearly…

113
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,839
Jeez.

114
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,383
Do you wish it had been worse?

115
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,260
You can talk to me.

116
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,057
-My sister--
-I didn't do anything!

117
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,101
Can't you see?

118
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,270
Your sister attacked me.

119
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,984
My gosh.

120
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,404
I have to say, you look just like her.

121
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,157
Goodness.

122
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,329
Gosh.

123
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,290
Hello? Darn it.

124
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,751
I'm being monitored.

125
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,172
I am at a police station now,
but not as the assailant.

126
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,466
I'm here as the victim.

127
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,177
I'll stay out of trouble.

128
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,138
I'll get this sorted out,
so don't book her.

129
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,099
It's not like I want to do this.

130
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,101
Why are there so many special laws?

131
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
Okay, will do.

132
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,688
Is she really studying law at your school?

133
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,570
I look "just like her"?

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,031
That's right.

135
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,491
Just like Kang Dan.

136
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,412
How do you know her?

137
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,125
She hasn't been coming home lately.

138
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,127
What?

139
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,046
INVESTIGATIONS UNIT 1

140
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,257
Have you been watching our home?

141
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,720
-Don't tell me you live--
-I need to talk to Dan

142
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,929
about something.

143
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,432
You need to talk to Dan?

144
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,683
About what?

145
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,768
If you're curious, bring her to me.

146
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,938
Don't worry about your little sister.

147
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,317
Let her go.

148
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,818
Yeah, I'm going to.

149
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,488
Looks like I've accomplished
my goal anyway.

150
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,956
Are you okay?

151
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,666
No.

152
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,668
I'm not okay.

153
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,386
Just one more drink

154
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,806
You know, I…

155
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,356
I gave up on the judicial exam
so I could teach.

156
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,274
Okay?

157
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,986
My wife always went on about

158
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,739
how Seo Byung-ju passed the exam
on the first try.

159
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:01,911
But I put up with her belittling me
and comparing me with him.

160
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,829
Why?

161
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,583
Because she's the mother of my child.

162
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:13,214
But when that jerk said to my face
that he could see why

163
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:19,637
my wife regretted marrying me
in that sneering tone,

164
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,806
I just…

165
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,184
couldn't control my anger.

166
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,232
Are you okay, sir?

167
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,282
Your dad's not at school either.

168
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,752
Why didn't you say anything?

169
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,715
I have a sweet tooth.

170
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,801
You needed Prof. Yang
to become the suspect--

171
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,718
Enough.

172
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,221
We'll talk at home.

173
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,612
What happened…

174
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,591
You two were out together?

175
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,348
What did you two talk about?

176
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,975
Ask your dad.

177
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,186
Professor Yang.

178
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,313
First, tell him that I saw you.

179
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,529
Yeah.

180
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,199
No.

181
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,992
I said it's fine.

182
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,453
I'll stay with Byeol, Mom.

183
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,413
Don't worry. Just do what you need to do.

184
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,540
All right, bye.

185
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,085
You should go home.

186
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,300
It's here.

187
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,512
Thanks for today.

188
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,223
-Go home.
-What about Lee Man-ho?

189
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,650
Sol.

190
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,236
Hey! Bye.

191
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,448
You must be Byeol.

192
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,117
That must've been scary.

193
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,662
I'm okay now.

194
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,830
What is this now?

195
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,459
This is Han Joon-hwi, my schoolmate.

196
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,754
Oh, the second-round passer?

197
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,257
Sol has told me a lot about you.

198
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,092
Hey, what are you talking about?

199
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,804
But you don't seem like
an arrogant show-off.

200
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,598
Oh, I see.

201
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,893
I'm not a show-off.
I'm just smart, that's all.

202
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,353
Yes, I see that.

203
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,438
You don't seem like the obnoxious type.

204
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,357
Hey, let's go inside.

205
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,483
-Okay.
-Bye!

206
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,917
You know, that smart guy…

207
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
He looks familiar.

208
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,047
Come on. Where could you have seen him?

209
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,800
Let's do this for now

210
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,218
and put up curtains later.

211
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,430
Byeol.

212
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,849
Are you really okay?

213
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,978
But it must've been so scary.
Get some sleep.

214
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,566
Where did I see him?

215
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,589
What happened…

216
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,723
Do you think the reason
she took your laptop

217
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,850
is connected to Professor Seo's death?

218
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,102
No, it wasn't her.

219
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,939
She was with me when the case broke out.

220
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,615
I killed him.

221
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,825
I'm the one
who got rid of the sugar packet

222
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,577
and stole the laptop.

223
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,204
It was all me.

224
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,415
Is it me this time?

225
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,094
KANG SOL B

226
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,891
You finally found me.

227
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,120
Prof. Yang brought you home.

228
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,503
So he saw you?

229
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,967
Why did you two meet up?

230
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,346
I wanted to tell him
why I walked back my alibi.

231
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,433
And? You told him?

232
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,488
Now that he knows I'm your daughter,

233
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,407
you can just tell him

234
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,950
you couldn't tell the police

235
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,036
that I was with you
to hide our relationship.

236
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,955
You can do that, right?

237
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,586
Yes.

238
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,130
Let's do that, then.

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,302
He told me to ask you directly.

240
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,556
I asked him what you two talked about.

241
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,266
Well…

242
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,977
Nothing much, really.

243
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,938
I was too drunk.

244
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,735
I don't need to worry, right?

245
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,990
Yes.

246
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,618
You know,

247
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,997
Mom's not the reason
I want to become a judge.

248
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,882
I'll wear the judge's robe

249
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,551
and replace that photo.

250
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,314
Some parents would gladly sacrifice
their lives for their children,

251
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,650
but some only show up
after their kids have died.

252
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,112
Let's say someone was abandoned
by their parents as a kid.

253
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,323
If they claim their inheritance rights
after the person dies,

254
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,407
the law currently…

255
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
Hey! The one who's dozing off.

256
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,912
Watch your head.

257
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,957
-Just sleep.
-No, it's okay.

258
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,792
It's okay.

259
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,168
The current Civil Code isn't

260
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,670
-equipped
-What's wrong with me?

261
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,421
-to stop
-How could you fall asleep?

262
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,758
such irresponsible parents
from claiming their inheritance rights.

263
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,096
Even the dog isn't helping.

264
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,482
This stupid dog!

265
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,793
Go home. Go.

266
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,129
Go find your mommy.

267
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,014
What are you doing?

268
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,935
You two.

269
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,605
What are you doing here?

270
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,244
This really doesn't suit the image
you've built up for yourself.

271
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,999
Everyone has a thing or two
that trigger their past trauma.

272
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,500
That's true.

273
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,964
But I must say, that dog was so tiny.

274
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,176
You can't use this as leverage over me.

275
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,928
Don't even dream of it.

276
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,889
If you tell anyone, I'll take you to court

277
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,974
-for uttering threats and defamation.
-Sure!

278
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,309
First-hand experience.

279
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,318
Teasing you is no fun
because you're so boring.

280
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,406
By the way, what were you doing
in front of my place?

281
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,784
Were you worried about us?

282
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,622
What? For real?

283
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
You duped me.

284
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,209
What? I duped you?

285
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,379
You sold me the books, remember?

286
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,296
What?

287
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,716
I bought them because you said
you were a Hankuk Law senior.

288
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,927
Are you sure I'll get in at once,

289
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,844
Ms. Senior?

290
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,221
"Ms. Senior"?

291
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,892
HANKUK UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE

292
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,523
Ms. Senior, remember me?

293
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,818
Hey, don't you remember me?

294
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,236
Hey.

295
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,570
What? No, I don't.

296
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,031
I don't remember you at all.

297
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,162
You were right after all.

298
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,497
You actually got in.

299
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,126
You must've felt guilty
lying about being a Hankuk Law student.

300
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,419
Well done.

301
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,505
I have no idea what you're talking about.

302
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,506
Hey!

303
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,633
I'm talking!

304
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,762
Let go of me.

305
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,431
-Let go!
-I said get in.

306
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,099
-Get in!
-Let go!

307
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,767
-I told you to get in.
-I'm off.

308
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,060
Ye-seul!

309
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,814
-Sol.
-We're not done talking yet.

310
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,482
Talk another time.

311
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,068
-Who's that?
-Stop. He's in my study group.

312
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,361
What?

313
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,947
I didn't know you had a guy friend.

314
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,033
Let's talk in the car.

315
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,161
Let's just go. You seem really upset.

316
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,538
Why do you care? She's my girlfriend.

317
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,457
Because she's worried about her.

318
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,542
Just talk another day.

319
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,128
I'm okay. Just go.

320
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,069

Doesn't Ye-seul's boyfriend
give you the creeps?

327
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,644
I really don't like him.

328
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,396
Yeah, something feels off.

329
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,773
Just like at the bookstore.

330
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,442
You remember, don't you?

331
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,239
My gosh, Byeol was that smart cookie.

332
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,907
You lied about being a law student,

333
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,450
and she turned it into reality.

334
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,510
Where is it?

Found it.

338
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,367
What is it?
Are you applying to a law firm?

MOTHER, KIM JEONG-A, AGE 55

340
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,745
Why do they need family info?

341
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,539
It's about time they got rid of it.

342
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,628
Because it's privately owned.
They want to look at your background.

349
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,790
DEFINING PUBLIC INTEREST
ACTED IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST

350
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,138
I'd like to speak with you.

351
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,182
Sure, take a seat.

352
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,697
I forgot to tell you
because I was too flustered.

353
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,242
Please don't tell anyone
that I'm Professor Kang's daughter.

354
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,494
The admin office knew about it.

355
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,246
I heard he told them

356
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,499
to please keep their lips sealed
so no one would find out.

357
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,127
I asked him to do it.
I didn't want anyone to find out.

358
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,878
I couldn't give up on this school

359
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,423
just because of my dad
when my grades were good enough.

360
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,882
I had no choice

361
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,969
but to take his course
because it was one of the prerequisites.

362
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,597
I thought people would know
if I switched courses,

363
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,308
so I just took his class.

364
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,102
But I did not receive
any special treatment.

365
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,857
I'm sure this isn't why
you called me last night.

366
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,818
That was…

367
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,322
About my dad changing his word

368
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,199
and saying he was actually with me--

369
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,493
You were asked about it
in front of the students.

370
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,704
Worried that they'd find out
about your dad,

371
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,539
you couldn't tell the cops the truth.

372
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,999
Correct.

373
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,209
All he did was back up my statement.

374
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,171
But you accused me of plagiarism.

375
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,922
That's why he told me the truth?

376
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,467
Yes.

377
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,095
Hey, I went through these…

378
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,764
Oh, sorry.

379
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,890
I'll leave.

380
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,600
-No, it's not urgent.
-I'm done.

381
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,684
It's really okay.

382
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,607
I think she plagiarized it.

383
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,195
Let's say she wrote this in middle school.

384
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,200
The problem is,
the contest took place ten years later,

385
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,538
so there were many new theories
and cases she could've referred to.

386
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,250
If she was smart enough to write that
in middle school,

387
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,087
do you think she'd copy and paste it

388
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,547
and submit it to the contest

389
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,841
without updating it
after entering law school?

390
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,430
Why did she do this?

391
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,434
She didn't need the award.

392
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,686
Even without that,
she was qualified to get in.

393
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,909
What are you going to do?

394
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,670
Would she want to kill me
if I took issue with it?

395
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,047
Why? Did she say that?

396
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,051
Well, her admission could be revoked
because of it.

397
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,886
Hold on.

398
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,098
-Do you think Kang Sol B--
-How would her parents feel?

399
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,145
Judging from what her mom has done
to sort out the mess…

400
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,522
Right, they would want to kill you.

401
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,610
If Prof. Seo wanted
to take issue with it...

402
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,946
What are you trying to get at?

403
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,657
My gosh! You found your laptop?

404
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,493
When? Where was it? How did you find it?

405
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,538
How far would you go
for the sake of your child?

406
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,666
I could die.

407
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,127
Would you kill someone?

408
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,211
Kill someone?

409
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,226
I heard…

410
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,979
you saw my daughter.

411
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,819
She wanted to know
what you told me last night.

412
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,906
Please don't tell her anything.

413
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,825
I'll turn myself in
before the end of the week,

414
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,411
so just until then.

415
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,707
The police would have nothing
but your confession.

416
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,627
You know they can't do anything
without evidence.

417
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,799
-The cup--
-You slipped a drug into his coffee?

418
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,968
Then you discarded the cup
and the empty sachet outside.

419
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,764
You drugged his coffee
before the mock trial began.

420
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,682
But then, he couldn't have conducted it.

421
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,684
He didn't drink it right away.

422
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,563
He drank it during the break.

423
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,900
Can you prove it?

424
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,864
There's no evidence or witness
to back up your statement.

425
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,284
Can you be convicted when my prints
were found in three different places?

426
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
The prosecution is hoping
that I get convicted.

427
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,500
-Professor Yang.
-My point is,

428
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,876
you turning yourself in

429
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,963
won't really help me prove my innocence.

430
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,843
Then…

431
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,686
Attend my trial tomorrow.

432
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,654
Professor Yang.

433
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,657
-You forgot this.
-Oh.

434
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,286
Are you good with computers?

435
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,288
Sorry?

436
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,957
How did you figure out the password
to my laptop?

437
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,333
It seems suspicious.

438
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,086
Oh, that.

439
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,297
There are many companies
that specialize in it.

440
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,842
Good to know.

441
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,935
Oh, there he is.

442
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,772
I can barely see his face
because of the cap and the mask.

443
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,275
I don't think he lives on campus.

444
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,444
Hold on, just before that.

445
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,361
Rewind it?

446
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:57,290
Is it another ransomware attack
like last time?

447
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,418
It was working fine earlier.

448
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,295
Did you back up everything?

449
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,089
Did I back up…
Yes, I followed your instructions.

450
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,134
Do I have to wipe everything
and reinstall all the programs?

451
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,637
Gosh, I'll have a meltdown
if I have to do that.

452
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,388
Don't worry. I got this.

453
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,146
JU-YEONG

454
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,107
It's okay even if it doesn't happen.
Just relax.

455
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,402
We can be happy without a baby…

456
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,906
That's not what I meant.
What I'm saying is…

457
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,700
We don't have to have a baby.

458
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,120
Okay.

459
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,081
All right.

460
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,921
Are you the one who dropped off my laptop
at the security office?

461
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,594
Seung-jae, they've just announced
the details of the court internship.

462
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
Really?

463
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,931
Which one will you apply for?

464
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,057
The court, right?

465
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,562
I wish my grades were good enough
for the court internship.

466
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,480
COURT INTERNSHIP

467
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,273
Sol B will get the internship, right?

468
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,525
She wants to be a judge.

469
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,486
My roommate's grades
are definitely good enough.

470
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,488
Gosh, I'm jealous.

471
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,533
Why not impersonate her?
You have the same name.

472
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,534
What?

473
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,579
Look at you getting all worked up.
It means you remember.

474
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,748
Fine, I remember. So what?

475
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,375
Hey, why are you getting angry?

476
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,086
Can't you tell that
I don't want to be reminded of it?

477
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,256
So drop it, okay?

478
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,137
Hey, Byeol.

479
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,307
You remembered what?
Do you have nothing better to do?

480
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,976
Just don't run into that neighbor.

481
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,561
Tell her I'm happy we met again.

482
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,148
Attend Prof. Yang's trial with me
if you want to go to the court.

483
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,107
I can go alone.

484
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,069
What's up with you two?

485
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,115
Hey.

486
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,450
REGARDING THE BAD FAMA CASE

487
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,201
I'm picking up the photocopies.

488
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,578
The pretty girl has them.

489
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,122
Me? When did you give them to me?

490
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,667
You wrote this?

491
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,923
Gosh, I should've just said
I couldn't do it.

492
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,260
I want to pull my hair out
because of those red lines.

493
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,972
Why would you pull your hair out?
Yang underlined the good parts.

494
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,558
What? For real?

495
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,518
Let me see.

496
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,104
He underlined most of it.

497
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,189
My goodness.

498
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,484
For real?

499
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,960
My gosh, it must be so nice to study here.

500
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,253
What an eye candy.

501
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,673
-What?
-"Eye candy"?

502
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,383
What's wrong with it?

503
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,804
Ye-seul, was that sexually inappropriate?

504
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,224
You think I'm pretty.

505
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,141
See?

506
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,728
Right, some girls may have never heard
such a compliment.

507
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,814
Now, that's insulting, right?

508
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,858
Ye-seul! I haven't seen you in a while…

509
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,236
I've gotten prettier, right?

510
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,279
All thanks to my beau, I guess?

511
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,533
She means, "Don't even dream of it."

512
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,867
You too.

513
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,662
Aren't you tired
of eyeing our study guides?

514
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,789
You never let me see it.

515
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,208
Can't you share it with me just once?

516
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,460
If I bomb my finals,

517
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,171
I'll be so embarrassed.

518
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,341
You've been there,
so you know what it's like.

519
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,259
Hey!

520
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,858
Got anything to say to me?

521
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,527
No.

522
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,419
What are you doing? Why take it down?

523
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,840
What are you doing?

524
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,841
And what is this?

525
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,467
Why would you…

526
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,762
APPOINTMENT FOR KANG SOL

527
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,097
I booked it.

528
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,474
Go see the psychiatrist with Sol.

529
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,894
What the heck are you doing?

530
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,105
-Get a grip!
-Look who's talking.

531
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,566
What did you do
just so Sol could become a judge?

532
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,361
Even if I've done something crazy,

533
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,780
you can't do this to me.

534
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,407
It's all your fault!

535
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,243
You should take responsibility
for all of it, if anything!

536
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,787
You're right.

537
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,165
It's my fault.
I will take responsibility for it.

538
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,377
So take Sol to the doctor
unless you want to mess her up.

539
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,338
Why would I mess her up?

540
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,464
That won't happen!

541
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,676
Honey.

542
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,387
Our daughter…

543
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,014
What about her?

544
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:06,974
She's doing fine.

545
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,935
Nothing's wrong with her.

546
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,186
Stop driving me nuts.

547
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,354
I told you it's fine.

548
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,815
Since you failed to become a judge--

549
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,733
Our daughter…

550
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,486
does not

551
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:20,947
deserve it.

552
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,368
Have you lost your mind?

553
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,415
You should see a psychiatrist.

554
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,138
Hankuk University law professor
Yang Jong-hoon's first trial

555
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,473
will begin shortly.

556
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,600
He's been consistently denying
his charges,

557
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,520
so a fierce court battle is expected.

558
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:57,942
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S FIRST TRIAL

559
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,987
The court is now in session.

560
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,531
Prosecution, please arraign Mr. Yang.

561
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,912
Yang Jong-hoon is charged
that he murdered Seo Byung-ju, the victim,

562
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:15,126
contrary to Article 250.1
of the Criminal Code.

563
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,131
Defendant.

564
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799
How do you plead to this charge?

565
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,092
Not guilty.

566
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,138
-You plead not guilty?
-Correct.

567
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,056
Thank you.

568
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,725
Defense counsel.

569
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,102
Your Honor, I request that the defendant

570
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,980
be placed under arrest before we move on.

571
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,482
Did you not get
the arrest warrant canceled?

572
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,026
At the time…

573
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,987
we had no choice
since we were misinformed.

574
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,198
But now that we know we were misinformed,

575
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,701
the reasons for his arrest
are still valid.

576
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,203
Since he is a former prosecutor
and a law professor,

577
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,372
he is well-versed in criminal procedure.

578
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,458
He's highly likely
to tamper with evidence.

579
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,378
Most notably, his laptop…

580
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,340
I was going to present this later.

581
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,052
Here is my laptop, which you've been
desperately looking for.

582
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,429
Analyze the data, fingerprints,
and take it apart.

583
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,555
Do whatever you want.

584
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,938
Let's just do this.

585
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:22,234
Let's just pretend we take it seriously,
or your dad will do something crazy.

586
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,948
He'll quit his job?

587
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,327
KANG SOL

588
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,329
Prof. Yang found his laptop.

589
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,955
-What? Really?
-He submitted it.

590
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,509
MY DAUGHTER

591
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,260
COMPOSE MESSAGE

592
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,429
DAD

593
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,348
I'm in court. Can't talk now.

594
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,974
I hope the session goes well.

595
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,892
PICK UP

596
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:55,851
Pick up.

597
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,021
DAD

598
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,481
DAD

599
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,608
The call cannot be connected.

600
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,028
Did Dad say anything else?

601
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,905
-Like what?
-Why does he want to resign?

602
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,906
Because you…

603
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,534
Never mind.

604
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,869
Come on. We'll be late.

605
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,788
What were you going to say? Say it.

606
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,459
Sol! Kang Sol!

607
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,336
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

608
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,299
Why did you look up

609
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,218
lethal dose of meth and how to get it?

610
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,930
I told you I left your laptop
on Prof. Kang's desk.

611
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:33,848
By his desk lamp.

612
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,477
Is Witness Kang Ju-man here?

613
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,895
WITNESS

614
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,813
Yes.

615
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,314
WITNESS

616
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,068
You said Prof. Kang kept asking you
if it really was my laptop.

617
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,280
That's right. I'm not sure why,
but he asked me several times.

618
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,532
Are you sure this is Kang Sol B's laptop?

619
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,077
I told him it was yours.
I said you didn't want to hand it over.

620
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,295
Prof. Kang takes the stand.

621
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,047
"Oath.

622
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,843
I solemnly affirm
that I will tell the whole truth

623
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,845
and nothing but the truth.

624
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,055
I understand that I would be…

625
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,521
committing perjury
if I said anything untruthful."

626
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,402
WITNESS

627
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,073
Prosecution, you may conduct
your direct examination.

628
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,926
You were in your office
at the time of the incident

629
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,514
and you never saw the sugar packet,
which was supposedly

630
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,642
at the scene that day,
according to the defendant.

631
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,812
This is what you told the prosecution,
correct?

632
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,525
Yes.

633
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,944
Your Honor.

634
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,280
The witness has verified
the authenticity of the statement made

635
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,907
in a particularly reliable state.

636
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,908
DICTIONARY

637
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,911
And since the defendant
has the right to cross-examine him,

638
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,330
this statement is considered
admissible evidence

639
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,249
despite the defendant's objection--

640
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,166
No.

641
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,084
JUDGE

642
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:27,920
-What?
-What?

643
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,004
What's going on?

644
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,089
-What now?
-My gosh.

645
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,759
I…

646
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,053
lied.

647
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,471
-What?
-About what?

648
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,603
Witness, so you're walking back
your statement?

649
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,691
Yes.

650
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,026
-What's going on?
-What did he lie about?

651
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,029
Which part of this is untrue?

652
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,823
The sugar packet.

653
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,325
It was there.

654
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,827
-What?
-My gosh.

655
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,203
What is happening?

656
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,246
WITNESS

657
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,915
I know because…

658
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,793
it was mine.

659
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:09,878
What?

660
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,422
-What?
-What does he mean?

661
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,007
What is going on?

662
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,804
I bet you knew about this.

663
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,598
You can't do this!

664
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,684
All these questions are useless now.

665
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:26,937
I rest my case.

666
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,733
He wants to stop things
from going in Prof. Yang's favor.

667
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,863
Counsel,
you may cross-examine the witness.

668
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,367
ACCUSED

669
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,535
Yes, Your Honor.

670
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,722
Witness.

671
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,265
Why…

672
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,142
did you lie?

673
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,479
Why?

674
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,357
WITNESS

675
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,695
I suppose I wanted people
to suspect Professor Yang.

676
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:17,863
-What?
-What?

677
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,448
-But why?
-What's he saying?

678
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,535
Right, but why?

679
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,248
That's…

680
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,710
Was there a reason you needed him
to be suspected of the murder?

681
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,172
Yes, there was.

682
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,173
-What?
-My gosh.

683
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,341
What is going on?

684
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,388
-It's…
-What was the reason?

685
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,308
Unless you're the one
who killed Seo Byung-ju…

686
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,434
Objection, Your Honor.

687
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,186
Just a moment.

688
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,229
JUDGE

689
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,271
Please continue.

690
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,651
Did you…

691
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,278
kill him?

692
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,999
I would like to

693
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,460
apologize to the victim.

694
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,213
-I killed--
-No.

695
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,799
No, Dad. Stop.

696
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,260
-"Dad"?
-Who's that?

697
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:23,971
What is this?

698
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:24,888
ACCUSED

699
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,891
KANG SOL B

700
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,309
Oh, I'm sorry.

701
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,605
I meant to hang up but must've pressed
the speakerphone button instead.

702
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,607
KANG SOL B

703
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,777
Your Honor,
this is considered contempt of court--

704
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,778
That is not true.

705
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,491
I'm the one who should be most excited
to hear him say he killed the victim.

706
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,243
Am I wrong?

707
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,746
Defendant, please be careful.

708
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,333
Counsel, you may continue.

709
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,251
Yes, Your Honor.

710
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,423
Witness.

711
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,217
Please finish your sentence.

712
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,597
Witness.

713
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,808
Yes.

714
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,855
-I'm the one who--
-Professor Kang.

715
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,112
I think you should listen
to your daughter.

716
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,325
What is this?

717
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,367
Please be seated.

718
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,012
My goodness.

719
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,305
She's his daughter?

720
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,350
Darn it. He obviously knew.
Why didn't he tell me?

721
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,478
Why must he make me look like an idiot?
Goodness.

722
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,021
You shouldn't be upset.

723
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,606
He has the upper hand now.

724
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,776
Still, this is unacceptable!
His attorney had no idea.

725
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,194
You fool.

726
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,197
You're all annoyed just because
the trial didn't go as expected.

727
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,990
How could I not be annoyed?

728
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,867
I didn't know he had found his laptop.

729
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,161
Where did he find it?

730
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,665
"I think you should listen
to your daughter."

731
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,916
When did you find out

732
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,876
that your roommate is his daughter?

733
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,503
What? Well…

734
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,505
What? Was it a shot in the dark?

735
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,590
Why does it matter?

736
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,261
We all heard his daughter say,
"No, Dad. Stop."

737
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,845
Then he should stop.

738
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,139
Parents should listen to their kids.

739
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,434
The fact that he's her father
isn't important.

740
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,186
What matters is why he did it.

741
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,109
Just a minute.

742
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,451
You thought…

743
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,872
I stole Prof. Yang's laptop, didn't you?

744
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,961
I thought you stole it, Dad.

745
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,632
The sugar packet too.

746
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,510
You thought I got rid of it.

747
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,678
Then why

748
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,847
didn't you say anything?

749
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,516
You said you saw this.

750
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,025
And you meant I should turn myself in.

751
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,985
What will you do with your made-up alibi?

752
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,821
Prof. Yang will see the police record.

753
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,823
Let's not do this.

754
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,868
-Let's turn--
-No, not that.

755
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,828
-I don't want my life to end here.
-Sol.

756
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,538
You said it was your fault.

757
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,251
You walked back your alibi because of me.

758
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,922
You're withdrawing his testimony?

759
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,343
This cross-examination is pointless
now that we can't trust his testimony.

760
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,677
It's pointless?

761
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,347
To the defendant, it's not.
That's why you're doing this.

762
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,474
Even after taking an oath
to tell the truth,

763
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,726
he tried to lie.
Hence, it should be withdrawn.

764
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,810
Is this possible?

765
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,147
The witness is already
being cross-examined.

766
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,149
You can't just nullify the whole thing.

767
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,109
He can't, right?

768
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,071
You have no authority to--

769
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,156
The cross-examination
hasn't been completed.

770
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,327
There's a special reason
the witness couldn't be trusted.

771
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,578
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

772
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,332
"Did you kill him?"

773
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,002
If you asked me that even just once,

774
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,963
we wouldn't be here now.

775
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,427
-Sol.
-But then again,

776
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,514
I couldn't ask you either.

777
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,231
I didn't do it.

778
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,151
You don't need to lie in court for me.

779
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,252
But he said he indeed saw
the sugar packet.

780
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,587
He tried to lie to us
that he killed the victim.

781
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,672
How do we trust him?

782
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:12,175
That's… Well, he has no reason
to lie about the sugar packet.

783
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,844
Because, if that was also a lie,

784
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,846
he'd be prosecuted for perjury.

785
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,433
And he'd lose his job
as a Hankuk Law professor.

786
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,522
The part about the sugar packet
is admissible.

787
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,778
As the prosecutor mentioned,
the cross-examination isn't over yet.

788
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:36,616
Witness testimony should be considered
as a whole.

789
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,286
So even if the witness
gave a false statement,

790
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,329
it is not considered perjury
if the witness

791
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,040
withdraws or corrects the statement
during the examination.

792
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:44,958
PROSECUTION

793
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,169
Need the case number?

794
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,087
Case number 2008D1053.

795
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,424
My point exactly.

796
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,344
If the part about the sugar packet
is also false, he may withdraw it.

797
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,555
Witness, would you like to withdraw it?

798
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,516
-Well--
-Your Honor.

799
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,976
I request this be aborted.

800
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,062
He gave a false statement.
We should reevaluate his credibility.

801
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,149
-If he's deemed disqualified--
-The counsel can bring him in again.

802
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,776
If he is deemed disqualified,

803
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,652
we will bring him in as our witness.

804
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,404
The prosecutor won't trust them.

805
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,989
Their witness can't be trusted.

806
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:18,950
Order.

807
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,581
We will not cancel our decision
on the witness.

808
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,461
However, the court agrees
with the prosecution

809
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,214
that his credibility as a witness
should be reevaluated.

810
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,884
You are a legal scholar,

811
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,054
so I'm sure you're aware
that perjury is a serious offense

812
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,891
as it can result
in miscarriages of justice.

813
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,352
JUDGE

814
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,062
The cross-examination may continue,

815
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,565
but the court will determine
whether or not

816
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,110
his testimony could be trusted.

817
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,074
So they don't trust him.

818
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,223
Thank you for stopping my dad.

819
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,311
Prosecution, you may conduct
your direct examination.

00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,406
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

825
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,323
Witness.

826
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,325
KANG SOL B
SPEAKER

827
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,537
You were in your office
at the time of the incident…

828
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,290
Sol A did, not me.

829
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,085
Dad and I could
clear up misunderstandings, thanks to you.

830
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,963
Misunderstandings…

831
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,841
I wonder why your dad thought that of you.

832
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,761
There could've been various reasons,
but this is a murder case.

833
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,264
It's not easy to suspect your own child.

834
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,393
If you're grateful to me, be honest.

835
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,146
He must've suspected you
because there was a strong motive.

836
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,524
Does your husband know?

837
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,777
How did you end up like this?

838
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,946
I told Dad

839
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,283
I wanted Professor Seo gone.

840
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,371
I also told him that
I couldn't stand seeing Mom belittling him

841
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,790
and comparing him to Prof. Seo.

842
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,127
That's enough to kill someone?

843
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,170
No.

844
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,590
That's why it's not me.

845
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,978
So she's still denying plagiarism.

846
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,481
What a shame.

847
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,233
The sugar packet is useless now.

848
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,780
The court won't accept
Mr. Kang's testimony.

849
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,199
But I guess you do.

850
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,326
Seeing how you found me
just to tell me that.

851
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,119
No.

852
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:14,709
I just wanted to tell you that
you'd never be able to bring me to trial.

853
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,420
You'll be notified soon.

854
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,340
See you next time.

855
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,396
PROSECUTOR LEE HAN-JU HAS BEEN
ASSIGNED TO CASE 2020-HJ1244

856
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,447
-Oh, who is he?
-What?

857
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,032
Get him on the camera!

858
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:46,950
What?

859
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,660
-What is this about?
-Hold on.

860
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:49,953
-Hey!
-Who is he?

861
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,205
No idea.

862
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,331
Then why take photos?

863
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,041
Because he looks creepy.

864
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,584
-Jeez.
-Come on.

865
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,294
-You fool.
-Look! Over there!

866
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,629
-My gosh!
-There he is!

867
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,217
-Why did you lie?
-Why did you lie?

868
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,260
Why did you do that?

869
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,594
Just a comment, please.

870
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,762
Stop, please!

871
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,556
-Mr. Kang.
-A comment, please.

872
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,391
-Mr. Kang!
-Anything you'd like to say?

873
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,767
Just a comment, please!

874
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,407
So Professor Kang is your father?

875
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,325
Can we talk another time?

876
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,994
-So tired that--
-I get it.

877
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,079
It would've been such a headache
to tell us.

878
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,249
Exactly. If you guys don't get it,
then who would?

879
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,292
We study together.

880
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,461
That's why my feelings are hurt.

881
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,838
-How could you hide it--
-You could do that.

882
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,508
It doesn't mean you can interrogate
someone like this.

883
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,889
Just try to understand.

884
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,432
What's with her?

885
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,934
I can't believe she's shielding you.

886
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,688
Oh, she wants to curry favor with you
because of your dad.

887
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,647
Me?

888
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,649
I'm sure the entire school knows now.

889
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,736
Here, look.

890
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,532

You look tired.

895
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,107
Can you rip up your resignation letter?

896
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,990
How did you know I didn't do it?

897
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,716
How far would you go
for the sake of your child?

898
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,510
I could die.

899
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,971
Would you kill someone?

900
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:13,888
Kill someone?

901
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,099
That I'm not sure.

902
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,995
Then could he have killed someone?

903
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,428
About my laptop.

904
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,514
I had never set a password.

905
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,781
Why didn't you say it's not you?

906
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,866
What do you mean?

907
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,203
Oh, that.

908
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,288
Let them think what they want.

909
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,917
When else would I get to be
a Hankuk Law professor's daughter?

910
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,212
-They'll gossip like crazy.
-They'll find out soon.

911
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,672
I'll be his daughter just until then.

912
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,632
Goodness.

913
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,302
My roommate has more than enough
on her plate now,

914
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,888
so she can deal with the gossip later.

915
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,934
By the way, why did the vice dean

916
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,852
try to lie that he killed Professor Seo?

917
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,980
That is perjury.

918
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,026
It must've had something to do
with my roommate.

919
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,697
Is she a law-ciopath?

920
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,494
Forget what I just said.

921
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,164
I'm saying crazy things
because of the psychopath I saw.

922
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,376
What do you want?

923
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,463
I told you.

924
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,299
Bring Kang Dan to me.

925
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,885
I haven't seen her for almost five years.

926
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,514
She cut all ties with us.
Why are you looking for her?

927
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:23,977
To find my son.

928
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,521
Apparently,

929
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,774
that psychopath is looking for my sister
to find his son.

930
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,028
Gosh, what nonsense…

931
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,575
I had a twin sister.

932
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:40,868
The owner of this?

933
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,245
YOUR GUIDE TO LEET

934
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,247
-How…
-You left it that day.

935
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,874
I read it because you said
it was very good.

936
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,044
Just throw it out.
I don't need it anymore.

937
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,130
Look inside.

938
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,764
What is this?

939
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,309

Hello?

950
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,379
SPEAKER

951
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,464

This is Kang Dan.

SPEAKER

956
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,643
Please tell me

957
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,146
if there's something I don't know
between you and Dan.

958
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,397
Can you handle it?

959
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,024
Prof. Yang is even eviler than Lee Man-ho.

960
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,777
-He's the devil.
-More into something else than the trial.

961
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,572
I have to meet her sister.

962
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,365
Wait. What's your name?

963
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,617
It's absurd
to say Prof. Seo wrote the paper.

964
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,119
How despicable.

965
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,245
Why me?

966
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,330
I needed your help for my revenge.

967
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,250
You wanted to put Professor Seo
in the dock?

968
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,420
What other deal did you make?
You better not mess with my student.

969
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,882
How dare Yang Jong-hoon
cast the bait at me?

970
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,259
-He has to be put away.
-I got an ace up my sleeve,

971
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,428
so he'll never get away with it tomorrow.

972
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,972
I request another witness
be brought in. I found

973
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,348
an eyewitness who saw

974
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,892
the defendant kill Seo Byung-ju.
