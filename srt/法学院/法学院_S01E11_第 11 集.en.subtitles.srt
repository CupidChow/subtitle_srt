1
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,239
CALLS

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,660
I said I did it alone because of a grudge!

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,704
No one put me up to it!

4
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,333
Stop taking wrong guesses.

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,836
Please excuse me.

6
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,518
I'm on my way now.

7
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:51,945
I'm here.

8
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,920
I just arrived.

9
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,880
It's the table under a beach umbrella
with a lit candle.

10
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,637
You promised you'd find him,
so keep your promise.

11
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,734
Is that my son?

12
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,154
Man, look.

13
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,616
You found my son!

14
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,764
Hey, grab your seats.

15
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,808
Sol, come on.

16
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,893
Look at the time. It's an ungodly hour.

17
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,812
You have no time with your internships,

18
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,355
so just give me an hour.

19
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,942
I start at the prosecutors' office,
so I couldn't even sleep.

20
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,360
You were snoring all night.

21
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,613
Joon-hwi is going there with you,
but he's not complaining at all.

22
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,157
Did you stay here all night?

23
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,619
I looked through
the precedents of jury trials,

24
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,747
but not many of the cases I found
were ruled acts of self-defense

25
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,041
in both regular trials and jury trials.

26
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,420
Jurors also rarely rule a case
for self-defense.

27
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,549
Only one case was ruled self-defense?

28
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,721
Which means jurors also have
a strict interpretation of self-defense.

29
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,556
Sex crime suspects are often acquitted,

30
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,182
and self-defense is rarely ruled.

31
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,059
Isn't that disadvantageous for Ye-seul?

32
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,561
Then a regular trial may be--

33
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,689
What if Ko Hyeong-su
uses his judiciary connections?

34
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,110
At least the judge can't rule as he likes
in a jury trial.

35
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,332
Let's go.

36
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,460
Come on in. Come on.

37
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,837
Come in.

38
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,673
So? Did you find anything
we can work with?

39
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,552
His attempt to distribute the video

40
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,846
has to be a fact
for this to be self-defense.

41
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,640
But Ko Yeong-chang insists
he took the video with consent

42
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,685
and was trying to delete it
to destroy our argument.

43
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,354
So we have to prove his argument is false.

44
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,024
Did he ever blackmail you through text?

45
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,363
He planted a spy cam in her alarm clock

46
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,784
then had the nerve to insist
he did it to keep her safe.

47
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,162
We may see it as a sign of a crime,
but he'll say it was love.

48
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,331
He's as sly as his father.

49
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,458
If you recorded him
when he blackmailed you…

50
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,293
Why are you blaming her?

51
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,253
Who does that in a relationship?

52
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,922
He even made spy cam videos.

53
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,006
When you found out,

54
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,759
you should've texted him
to delete it right away.

55
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,054
Should've been more thorough
as a law student.

56
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,889
She did the best she could.

57
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,224
MEDICAL REPORT: INJURY

58
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,560
If you had this,
why didn't you report him?

59
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,064
Well…

60
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,399
The police and the prosecution

61
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,485
already asked her that a million times.

62
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,403
Then you should've answered better.

63
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,448
Your statement at the police
differs from that at the prosecution.

64
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,993
The consistency of a victim's story
is important for sex crimes.

65
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,245
I think it's unfair

66
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,123
to find someone guilty
from consistency alone.

67
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,207
What if they lie well?

68
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,877
Even if they do it with consent,
they can later stick to the rape story.

69
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,420
That's not what we're saying.

70
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,421
What?

71
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,132
-What I meant was--
-I'm sorry.

72
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,884
It's all because of me.

73
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,177
Well…

74
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,721
Hey.

75
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,558
I mean, the evidence of his assault

76
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,519
doesn't prove that
he recorded the spy cam videos.

77
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,354
If someone can be this violent,

78
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,440
doesn't it show
he's capable of recording--

79
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,443
Did you go to dreamworld
in Yangcrates's class?

80
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,862
Analogical reasoning doesn't apply here.

81
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,156
Wait, it might work on the jurors

82
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,157
if we show these.

83
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,786
Before we do that,
they'll see these first.

84
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,754
Let's eat gimbap before we proceed.

85
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,300
Here.

86
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,849
Don't let what Sol said get to you.

87
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,102
Both she and Ji-ho can be
too straightforward and mean.

88
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,228
It's all right.

89
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,730
What she said is right.

90
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,816
You should go to your internship.

91
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,901
Gosh.

92
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,195
-What?
-I mean…

93
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,907
I'm trying to be a human rights lawyer,
but this world won't help me out.

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,367
How can every single office turn me down?

95
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,121
Even so, I can't believe you're going
to the greedy Park Geun-tae's office.

96
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,789
What would you learn there anyway?

97
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,917
So what about you?

98
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,545
Did you find anyone who'll take you?

99
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,297
Hey, at least I took this guy.

100
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,133
But you? No, thank you.

101
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,551
I'd turn you down first.

102
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,094
I got scared that you might come.

103
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,013
My gosh.

104
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,933
-Hello, this is Park Geun-tae--
-Hey!

105
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,392
What?

106
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,188
Move your beat-up car right now!

107
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,690
This is where I park my bike!

108
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,484
Prof. Kim wanted to see me!

109
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,237
Shut your mouth
and move your car right this instant.

110
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,906
Hurry!

111
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,035
Prof. Yang is certain
about your plagiarism.

112
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,081
But I began to doubt it a little
after I heard your story.

113
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,585
I agree that you were smart enough
to write a paper on that subject

114
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,003
back in middle school.

115
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,091
But what if you're so smart
that you can hold out like this

116
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,635
even after copying his paper?

117
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,846
You said you began to doubt…

118
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,433
if I really copied his paper.

119
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,105
If you began to be doubtful,

120
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,983
it means
Prof. Yang's conviction is dangerous.

121
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,742
My goodness.

122
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,710
Everyone named Kang Sol is rude.

123
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,588
-What is it?
-Attorney Park, grab a seat.

124
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,550
I get scared when you call me
Attorney Park, Prof. Kim.

125
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,051
Just call me Geun-tae.

126
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,094
Attorney Park.

127
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
Have you heard of Bad FaMa?

128
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,223
-What perm?
-Bad FaMa.

129
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,808
Yes, what kind of perm?

130
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,020
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

131
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,944
I was really excited about coming here,

132
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,530
but why are we assigned
to Jin Hyeong-u's office?

133
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,576
All I did was sit in his trials.

134
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,328
Do you think he'll recognize me?

135
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,039
Gosh, I'm really scared.

136
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,541
Joon-hwi.

137
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,835
Gosh.

138
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,420
Joon-hwi, wait.

139
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,672
Are you okay with this?

140
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,633
What's not to be okay with?

141
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,051
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

142
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,679
Hello, we're from Hankuk Law School--

143
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,014
Are you here as an intern?

144
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, my name is Cho Ye-bum.

145
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,684
Han Joon-hwi.

146
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,020
We meet again.

147
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,653
HYEONGSEOL ONLY STRIVES TO WIN

148
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,079
Take a seat.

149
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,254
I knew you seemed familiar.
I saw you in court.

150
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,966
So you're in a study group
with Jeon Ye-seul?

151
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,137
We are, but we aren't very close.

152
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,306
"We aren't close."

153
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,852
You'd know a law firm like ours
has very good information.

154
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,356
I believe your study group
is helping her defense.

155
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,150
I did it against my will
because of Prof. Yang's order,

156
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,403
and I got out before I came here.

157
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,571
You got out?

158
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,741
That was unnecessary.

159
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,207
One second.

160
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,253
I said take it down now.

161
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,213
I'll send the money then.

162
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,513
HYEONGSEOL LAW FIRM

163
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,784
You'll be dismissed right here
as of today.

164
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,370
-Sir.
-But here's a guarantee.

165
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,164
As soon as you pass the bar exam,

166
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,458
you can start at our law firm right away.

167
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,423
Seung-jae is here right now.

168
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,593
Where do you think I am?
I'm at the Prosecutors' Office.

169
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,813
Mr. Yu.

170
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,274
Have a seat.

171
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,697
You two both seem very flustered.

172
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,417
This law student, a future officer,

173
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,670
committed a serious crime
and hacked into people's computers.

174
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,300
He had the nerve to hack
professors' laptops for test questions.

175
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,387
Do you know what's funnier?

176
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,932
Mr. Yu's hacking incident

177
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,852
became the smoking gun in proving
defendant Yang Jong-hoon's alibi.

178
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,397
But I don't buy that as the prosecutor.

179
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,360
Shouldn't you have this case reassigned?

180
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,736
Reassigned?

181
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,280
-You're in charge of Prof. Yang's--
-Why?

182
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,993
Do you think I'll make some kind of deal
with this suspect,

183
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,495
who's Prof. Yang's student?

184
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,669
If you're suspicious,

185
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,755
you can question him,
Officer Han Joon-hwi.

186
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,677
You're an intern here,
so I'll let you question the defendant,

187
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,428
although others only let you sit in.

188
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,097
Here.

189
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,392
Let's see

190
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,436
how good you are, Mr. Second-Round Passer.

191
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,278
You're right.

192
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,740
Can assemblymen's offices
really recruit interns from law schools?

193
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,369
It's unusual, but I'm sure
he put it out because he could.

194
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,413
He's on the Judiciary Committee, too.

195
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,458
He's working very hard
even after his son got hurt.

196
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,546
Anyway, you're going to apply for this?

197
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,258
I know you didn't make it at a court
or the Constitutional Court, but this is…

198
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,093
I don't care for big-name firms,

199
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,679
and the National Assembly
sounded fun as the legislative.

200
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,349
-Do you want to join me?
-Me?

201
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,977
You couldn't find an internship
and couldn't sleep.

202
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,771
I was looking for precedents
of jury trials--

203
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,523
I'm not sure if they'll take you.

204
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,195
I may be desperate, but I can't go here.

205
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,864
-No, I can't.
-You can't what?

206
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,490
Hello.

207
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,451
You still need an internship?

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,289
An internship with Assemblyman Ko?

209
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,264
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

210
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,559
Are you aware that prosecution questioning
can be used as evidence?

211
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,855
My statement remains the same
as what I said to the police.

212
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,398
Let me clarify a few things.

213
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,110
Why did you turn yourself in?

214
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,196
Yes, you've been hacking
since the first semester.

215
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,614
Why at this point…

216
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,240
Go ahead.

217
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,495
I was afraid…

218
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,584
I could turn an innocent man
into a murderer.

219
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,681
Do you mean
you might not have turned yourself in

220
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,016
if that didn't happen to Mr. Yang?

221
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,566
Would you have continued
if you hadn't been caught?

222
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,694
That's…

223
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,450
Yes.

224
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,869
I could have.

225
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:40,499
If his innocence could've been proven
without your testimony,

226
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,502
you may never have come forward then.

227
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,717
Do you only feel guilty when someone dies?

228
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,638
What you did not only led to mistrust
of Hankuk Law School's grading system.

229
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,891
You also caused a relative sense of loss
to your fellow students

230
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,394
who study until the point
they look like zombies.

231
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,689
Shouldn't you have been tormented
by such reasons?

232
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,858
Go easy on him.

233
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,318
Bring him some water.

234
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,781
"I needed to stop
Mr. Yang from becoming a murderer."

235
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,867
Is that your conscience?

236
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,912
Or did Mr. Yang find out
about your hacking problem,

237
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,122
and you couldn't help but do--

238
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,124
-Joon-hwi.
-I am here…

239
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,626
on behalf of the prosecutor.

240
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,962
Just answer my question.

241
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,644
On the day of the incident,

242
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,273
did you really overhear the conversation

243
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,734
Mr. Yang had on the phone
with Mr. Seo Byung-ju…

244
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,945
in his office closet?

245
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,343
Are you all right?

246
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,763
Joon-hwi seemed like
a completely different person,

247
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,681
as if he's possessed by Prosecutor Jin.

248
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,100
We have so much history.

249
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,727
How can he be so harsh on you?

250
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,530
Seung-jae.

251
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,740
If I hadn't done that…

252
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,618
I know.

253
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,374
Seung-jae.

254
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,303
If it hadn't been for you,
you think I would've done that?

255
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,597
So it's better that you do it?

256
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,607
It's better to get bitten
by a crazy dog from another family.

257
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,693
If your own pet dog bites you…

258
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,364
it really breaks your heart right here.

259
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,786
Right.

260
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,455
Some credit is due.

261
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,793
Officer Han Joon-hwi,
you've done very well.

262
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,796
You're a born prosecutor.

263
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,300
I should learn from you.

264
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,645
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

265
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,565
So there are two Kang Sols
at Hankuk Law School.

266
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,276
You want to be in the judiciary,

267
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,612
so why do you want
to come and work for me?

268
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,448
I want to experience
the process of lawmaking.

269
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,076
Passing the Lee Man-ho Act
to turn a crisis into an opportunity

270
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,494
was very impressive.

271
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,415
If you let me work with you, not for you,

272
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,626
then I'll be extremely useful.

273
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,962
All right. You got the job.

274
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,222
You're rather shameless, aren't you?

275
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,558
How dare you come here.

276
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,769
KO HYEONG-SU

277
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,438
I barely managed to pass my year,

278
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,398
so it's tough to find an internship.

279
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,152
And you're supposed
to keep enemies closer.

280
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,153
Enemies?

281
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,197
Because I've been helping Ye-seul.

282
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,576
The one whom you interviewed before me
is also helping her out.

283
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,622
If you give the job only to her,
won't people get suspicious of you?

284
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,539
People may think

285
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,001
you're trying to bribe her
to find out what our defense strategy is.

286
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,796
Do you think
I'll fall for such a petty trick?

287
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,591
I couldn't care less about your strategy.
Get lost.

288
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,933
Assemblyman Ko will be interested in this.

289
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,147
How did you…

290
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,443
Prof. Kim asked if you'd be willing
to take me with that document.

291
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,907
Well, to the point that she'd offer this?

292
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,500
Jin played a smart move.

293
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,672
He made you go after Seung-jae,

294
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,384
then he'll sit back and comfort him.

295
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,434
I wasn't thinking.

296
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,562
He got the best of me.

297
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,492
You're after the culprit.

298
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,831
It had no fingerprints.

299
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,755
Width, 13 cm, length, 30 cm.
They're for a shoe size of 275 mm.

300
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,691
Someone who could stab the stomach at once
would have to be a doctor or a nurse.

301
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,569
-Or…
-You'd have to know your anatomy.

302
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,321
It was for organ trafficking.

303
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,448
Like a history of organ trading.

304
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,712
The real culprit
must've wiped the fingerprints.

305
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,506
Why didn't he destroy this?

306
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,716
Why do you think Ki Du-seong gave me those

307
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,510
instead of pointing to the culprit?

308
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,181
Your gut feelings could be wrong.

309
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,391
It means

310
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,728
there is someone who instigated my death
behind the real culprit.

311
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,897
Sorry?

312
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,815
QUESTIONNAIRE

313
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,733
I CONFIRM EVERYTHING AS THE TRUTH

314
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,068
Byeol.

315
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,945
Sol!

316
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,032
Is she asleep?

317
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,913
Mom, get up.

318
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,874
Stop avoiding me.

319
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,129
You're avoiding me
because of the notarized document, right?

320
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,930
You know who Ko Hyeong-su is.

321
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,350
And that he approached Byeol's dad
to shut Dan's mouth, right?

322
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,481
-You knew.
-So what if I did?

323
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,902
He was about to lose his organs
because of his gambling debt.

324
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,154
So I begged her

325
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,240
to help me out just that one time.

326
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,241
I did that…

327
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,537
because I didn't know
what that would mean for her.

328
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,000
So why are you doing this to me?

329
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,002
Why are you doing this to me?

330
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,067
I heard you were assigned
to Prosecutor Jin.

331
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:46,985
Yes.

332
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,571
Don't bring Seung-jae up. What about Choi?

333
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,784
He deleted the photo of the toy.

334
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,038
Which means he's emotionally shaken.

335
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,750
Keep knocking on his door
until he opens up his heart.

336
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,295
I'll look for a lead
to publication of suspected crimes

337
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,546
next to Prosecutor Jin.

338
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,636
How did it go at the law firm? Doing okay?

339
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,600
Fired? You got fired? Over what?

340
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,810
Because of Ye-seul?

341
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,105
Where's Ji-ho? Is he okay?

342
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm not okay.

343
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,153
You were there for a few days.
Did you hear anything on their strategy?

344
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,033
Did they ask you anything?

345
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,247
In return, there is something
we want to hear from you.

346
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,916
They wanted me to say
that Ye-seul was dating Joon-hwi.

347
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:43,875
MUST FIND EVIDENCE!

348
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,880
Their argument is that
Ye-seul was two-timing him with me.

349
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,966
They'll try to prove that to the jurors.

350
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,970
And they'll want to do that through you,
people I study with every day.

351
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
It'd be a jackpot
if they get it out of his roommate, Ji-ho.

352
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,684
Then they shouldn't have fired him.

353
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,769
If they hold him down,
it'd look like a deal.

354
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,187
Right.

355
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,064
The credibility plummets, too.

356
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,607
That's false witness anyway.

357
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,858
You're fired because…

358
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,610
I don't know if I'll say yes or no.

359
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,736
Hey, Ji-ho.

360
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,698
Didn't you catch Ko Yeong-chang
at Ye-seul's dorm

361
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,824
and make him sign a note?

362
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,992
Don't answer that.

363
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,369
Is there anything suspicious
in your text with her?

364
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,871
I need to shut him up. Stop talking.

365
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,501
1ST PRETRIAL HEARING

366
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,544
Starting now,

367
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,797
we will begin the pretrial hearing
of the jury trial

368
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,091
for case number 2020-GH311.

369
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,051
Your Honor.

370
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,222
May I request that the prosecution
do something before we begin?

371
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,559
I hope you won't play dirty

372
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,854
and emphasize that I'm currently
getting tried for murder charges

373
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,356
to the jurors of this jury trial.

374
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,942
Play dirty? What do you think of us?

375
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,985
Cut it out.

376
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,112
We won't do that.

377
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,033
Please begin.

378
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,036
This trial ends in a day.

379
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,204
Can you reduce the number of witnesses?

380
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,914
We selected only the ones we need.

381
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,624
Then let's do it over two days--

382
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,543
The jurors may get contaminated.

383
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,504
Are you suggesting
we'll try to bribe the jurors?

384
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,007
No, not you, prosecutors.

385
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,759
I meant the victim's father.

386
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,762
He put pressure on attorneys
to get her locked up,

387
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,263
so I ended up sitting here.

388
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,640
Who knows what he'll do to the jurors?

389
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,641
Defense counsel.

390
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,310
Please begin.

391
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,982
He can't be tried in this state.

392
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,484
Exactly.

393
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,736
That's why I want to show them
my situation!

394
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,987
Keep it down.

395
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,368
It was about time

396
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,871
I needed to bring up something big.

397
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,957
Then she brought a present from you,
Prof. Kim.

398
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,335
How could I turn her down?

399
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,712
I had no choice but to take her.

400
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,551
The abolition of defamation
by publicly alleging facts

401
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,679
and claiming punitive damages
through a civil case?

402
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,601
It may not be as big
as the Lee Man-ho Act,

403
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,977
but it'll be a big issue.

404
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,979
I can draw attention, too.

405
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,274
If you want attention,
you should have a press conference, too.

406
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,237
If you do it
on the day of the Bad FaMa jury trial,

407
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,655
it'll be the best timing.

408
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,824
MAKE SIMPLE COPIES ON YOUR OWN

409
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,991
Prof. Kim.

410
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,161
About the abolishment
of causing defamation by facts.

411
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,456
I don't think you should hand over
your important and hard work

412
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,083
to a man like Ko Hyeong-su.

413
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,669
I don't have to do the internship,
so if it was for--

414
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,254
Why would she do that for you?

415
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,423
She wouldn't give it up for you.

416
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,049
Exactly. Why would you do that?

417
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,218
I'm sure she has a plan.

418
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,220
Just go do your internship.

419
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,680
Prof. Kim.

420
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,765
You record my lectures, right?

421
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,850
What? Of course.

422
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,561
Why did you give that bill
to Assemblyman Ko?

423
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,105
What about the time
when Lee Man-ho came in?

424
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:59,446
I need to blow up this issue
so that the media will stay away

425
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,323
from reporting on his case.

426
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,494
The contents look
very meticulous and thorough.

427
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,871
It looks excellent.

428
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,334
Right, do you know a website
called Bad FaMa?

429
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,839
I heard it's a website that exposes
parents who don't pay child support.

430
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,509
Why do you ask?

431
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,555
I heard
the defamation suit is a jury trial.

432
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,307
When's the trial?

433
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,144
It's on the same day
as Yeong-chang's trial.

434
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,063
Is that so?

435
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,566
QUESTIONNAIRE

436
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,278
There are 41 candidates who expressed
their interest in becoming a juror.

437
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,364
Among them,
40 people sent back the questionnaires.

438
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,365
You'll find information

439
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,869
such as their gender, age, job,
education, family relations,

440
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,746
and other basic information.

441
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,164
Supplemental questionnaire…

442
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,418
Come on.
You should be the most invested in this.

443
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,337
-That's not helpful.
-What are you saying?

444
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,215
About half of the ruling
is decided from the jury selection.

445
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,300
The battle here is the most furious.

446
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,886
To find jurors
who'll rule in Ye-seul's favor…

447
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,054
Give it a good try.

448
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,096
Hey.

449
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,640
Prof. Yang--

450
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,809
Prof. Yang.

451
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,021
What's with him?

452
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:18,441
He volunteered as an attorney
to turn this into a jury case.

453
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,862
How can they give this to us
two days ago, not even two weeks?

454
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,533
It's in our hands now,
so we'll make good use of this.

455
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,701
This might be better for her.

456
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,994
If we got this two weeks ago,

457
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,790
Ko's side would've run background checks
and had more information than us.

458
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,836
You're right. I wouldn't put it past
Ko Hyeong-su to bribe the jurors.

459
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,838
Getting favorable jurors is important,

460
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,215
but will the jurors like
Prof. Yang's style?

461
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,551
You're right.

462
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,888
The prosecution brought a star prosecutor
who won every single jury trial she had.

463
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,725
She captures the jurors with her charms.
Her name even means "juror," Bae Sim-won.

464
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,729
COURT

465
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,733
Don't try to teach the jurors.

466
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,611
You can't press on them
or push them like your students.

467
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,449
And that face.
Don't make that face before the jurors.

468
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,912
Don't. You have to present yourself
looking very sharp.

469
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,499
Jury trials are different
from criminal trials.

470
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,042
To get on their good side--

471
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,795
I'm not going to do that.
Facts and legal principles--

472
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,380
That's not all.

473
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,716
Are you going to ruin Ye-seul's trial?

474
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,384
In order to persuade the jurors

475
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,970
who have good ethics
but minimal legal principles,

476
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,556
your impression and attitude matter.

477
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,977
The more you seem likable,
the easier it is to persuade them.

478
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,647
That's why Prosecutor Bae
is good at jury trials.

479
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,150
She's your biggest enemy.

480
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,776
So was Jin Hyeong-u.

481
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,113
But you never turned him down.
Back in the training institution--

482
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,698
You turned me down coldly.

483
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,911
Long time no see.
It's great to see you, my friend.

484
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,162
Sure, nice to see you.

485
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,872
He turned me down ages ago.

486
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,207
I wouldn't hold a grudge to this day…

487
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,959
No, I would. I liked you that much.

488
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,753
You look the same, Jong-hoon.

489
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,549
But this fight isn't that hard.
I can leave my grudge out of this.

490
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,385
A fight in a courtroom?
You mean a dispute.

491
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,638
We'll have to see if it's hard or not.

492
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,432
You're all here.

493
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,767
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

494
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,021
You heard that Prosecutor Ha's mother
passed away this morning, right?

495
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,231
I did.
And that you'll be covering for him.

496
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,818
It's my first time at a jury trial,
so I'll learn a lot.

497
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,531
She's the prosecutor
for the jury trial today.

498
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,369
These are probationary officers
from Hankuk Law School.

499
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,037
Nice to meet you. Learn a lot.

500
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,124
You probably don't know
because you're only doing trials.

501
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,753
This is the guy whom the defendant
two-timed the victim with.

502
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,217
Special Attorney Yang Jong-hoon
better be ready for this trial.

503
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,555
May I have a word with you?

504
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,980
The hearing will continue.

505
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,358
There was zero possibility that
it was an injection instead of drugs.

506
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,069
Did you say
the needle stabbed his stomach?

507
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,321
There was no record
in the first autopsy report.

508
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,031
That's why I disagreed,

509
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,075
to summon and check with the examiner.

510
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,536
Sadly, he couldn't be reached.

511
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,538
That's why that autopsy report was used,

512
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,456
which could've left out the information.

513
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,709
The examiner
who conducted the autopsy again

514
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,211
also did not see
a needle mark on his stomach.

515
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,630
He wouldn't care
if he came to tamper with the case.

516
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,260
Even if he did, he couldn't have
seen anything after the first autopsy.

517
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,221
Yu Seung-jae…

518
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,599
won't speak as you wish he would.

519
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,729
Do whatever you want.

520
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,776
BILL ABOLISHING DEFAMATION BY FACTS

521
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,862
This is doubly annoying.

522
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,530
Why are we putting on a show?

523
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,657
He's doing this
on the day of his son's trial.

524
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,492
Bad FaMa's trial is today, too.

525
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,911
That's why this feels even worse.

526
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,914
Not only is he making use
of the proposal from Prof. Kim.

527
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,499
He's also slyly using Bad FaMa.

528
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,419
Bad FaMa might be using
this bill proposal instead.

529
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,754
What?

530
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:11,382
It abolishes defamation by facts
then offers claiming punitive damage, too.

531
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,676
Prof. Kim worked very hard on this one.

532
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,304
Why do you think
she handed over such great work to him?

533
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,056
Then her plan was…

534
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,558
Bad FaMa will benefit from this, too.

535
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,603
A strong political figure
is swaying the media, too.

536
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,646
Prof. Kim came up with a good plan.

537
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,274
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

538
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,859
ABOLISHING DEFAMATION BY FACTS

539
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,985
Hey.

540
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,654
Prosecutor Jin? All of a sudden?

541
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,158
Yes, the investigating prosecutor
just lost his mother.

542
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,243
Anyway, that sly man.

543
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,288
The only thing he told us
was to come and sit at his trial,

544
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,332
and it was Ye-seul's trial.

545
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,460
Wait.

546
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,296
Prof. Yang also found out about it
just now?

547
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,300
I'll call you back.

548
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,927
Mom.

549
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,263
What is this? What happened?

550
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,850
I slipped on a staircase
while handing out flyers.

551
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,644
I'm fine.

552
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,270
Why didn't you tell me?

553
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,606
You came here to be a juror like this?

554
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,192
They said I'll get 60,000 won
just for showing up.

555
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,447
I can't even make 50,000 won
for handing out flyers all day.

556
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,033
That's odd.
I didn't see your questionnaire.

557
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,082
I forgot to turn that in.

558
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,000
Is it too late to hand that in?

559
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,424
I was busy, so I forgot to turn it in.
I'm sorry.

560
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,015
I'm so nervous.
I should've taken a calming pill.

561
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,100
What if I get dropped?

562
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,602
It'd be great if you do it,
but this is done randomly.

563
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,272
If you don't make it,
watch Ye-seul's trial.

564
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,773
I really want to make it.

565
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,899
Of course he should.

566
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,486
He stopped me from defending her
to be a juror.

567
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,156
If you look so desperate,

568
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,074
there's a chance they'll drop you.

569
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,410
-So try to look indifferent.
-Okay.

570
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,662
Don't say or do anything to stand out.

571
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,290
Prof. Kim, I have to talk to you.

572
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,795
And don't appear to be
strongly opinionated.

573
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,298
Try to remain uncertain and vague.

574
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,799
Once you get selected,

575
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,219
you can show your claws
during the deliberation.

576
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,137
Okay?

577
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,221
I see.

578
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,557
Did you all get your numbers?
Did I miss anyone?

579
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,642
Me! Over here! Coming!

580
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,935
I should run. Okay.

581
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,103
I hope he gets dropped.

582
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,314
You can do it!

583
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,277
I brought my contract,

584
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,695
so let's wait here,

585
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,947
and if he gets dropped,
let's join the counsel.

586
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,991
You said she won't be found innocent.

587
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,659
You saw the reporters out there.

588
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,580
Assemblyman Ko is interested in this case,
and so should I.

589
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,664
My gosh.

590
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,751
If you handed over that awesome bill to Ko

591
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,753
to use it in Bad FaMa's favor
for the trial…

592
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,589
I think it's really wrong.

593
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,634
Assemblyman Ko is trying to use

594
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,303
Bad FaMa's trial
to raise his approval ratings,

595
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,388
but you're using him for Bad FaMa's trial,

596
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,349
so how are you different from him?

597
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,019
You should be different
from a guy like Ko Hyeong-su.

598
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,104
I should be.

599
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,857
It has started.

600
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,692
Speaking the truth

601
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,071
must be protected
under our freedom of speech.

602
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,364
PRESS CONFERENCE

603
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,407
It is unconstitutional

604
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,619
to criminally punish a person

605
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,955
who has spoken the truth

606
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:33,251
to protect the reputation of someone
built upon falsehood.

607
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,545
Article 307.1 of the Criminal Code

608
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,257
and Article 70.1
of the Act on Information Protection

609
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,843
can punish individuals
for publicizing facts.

610
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,013
I wish to abolish
defamation by alleging facts

611
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,267
and put an end to this unfair suffering

612
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,145
as the victims
are turned into perpetrators.

613
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,773
Once this bill passes,

614
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,359
defamation cases like Bad FaMa's,

615
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,528
held today as a jury trial,

616
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,615
will no longer be subject
to criminal penalties.

617
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,662
It's different from the deal we made!

618
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,872
Darn it.

619
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,666
Man.

620
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,752
-I will stop this.
-I came to find my son here.

621
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,753
Questions, please.

622
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,798
I believe a related bill
has been proposed already.

623
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,216
But it's me.

624
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm not just proposing this.

625
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,638
I will make sure it passes,
just like the Lee Man-ho Act.

626
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,764
PRESS CONFERENCE

627
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,436
Eleven years ago,
you called me an asshole, judge.

628
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,937
You must be relieved

629
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,732
the criminal statutory limitations
and the civil statute of limitations

630
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,816
have expired.

631
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,902
But I'll make sure these people
who are within the statutory limitations

632
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,406
are punished,
and I'll file for compensation, too.

633
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,658
Look, that's not the attitude of a thief,
is it?

634
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,702
I'm showing the bitterness of the law.

635
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,078
After Lee Man-ho's release,

636
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,788
I came to know

637
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,541
that he is preparing to sue

638
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,669
those who have criticized him
for defamation.

639
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,297
I was appalled.

640
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,219
If he sincerely reflected on his actions
and wanted to atone for his crimes,

641
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,390
how could he do anything like this
as a human?

642
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,892
-Damn it!
-I wish to have

643
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:16,604
this bill passed as soon as possible
because of Lee Man-ho.

644
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,232
When you call a wicked man wicked,

645
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,986
it would be absurd for anyone
to be charged criminally.

646
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,953
Don't you think Lee Man-ho
will sue you for defamation?

647
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,831
All I did was state the truth.

648
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,541
I must

649
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,002
pass this bill before he does that.

650
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,837
Even if he sues me,

651
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,549
I won't back down
and will, rather, face it gladly.

652
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,719
I will show Lee Man-ho, that wicked man,

653
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,598
what justice looks like.

654
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,064
Where are you going?

655
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,774
Oh, well…

656
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,694
You aren't on your way to the court,
are you?

657
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,446
Will you come with us?

658
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,823
Why would I go there?

659
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,159
It's already shameful,
so why are you two going?

660
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,789
Assemblyman Ko and I worked hard
to make sure the trial stays quiet.

661
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,877
Let's go watch it quietly.

662
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,800
People are already saying
Hankuk Law School is the hotbed of crime.

663
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,593
Only if they're both found guilty.

664
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,431
If they're all innocent,
this will be an amazingly valuable lesson.

665
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,186
So you're insisting on going there?

666
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,856
Assemblyman Ko is at the court, too.

667
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,025
Come with us.

668
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,156
COURT

669
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,076
And now, we will begin
the jury selection process.

670
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,663
If a juror candidate
makes a false statement

671
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,999
in the selection process,

672
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,336
you may be fined up to two million won
according to Article 60

673
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,340
of the Act on Citizen Participation
in Criminal Trials.

674
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,678
Now, please take a look at the screen.

675
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,727
Once you are seated
in the jury seat on the day of the trial,

676
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,898
judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel
will ask you many questions.

677
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,567
IN SESSION

678
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,069
That's the end of my internship today.

679
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,988
It took a toll on my heart.

680
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,617
His darned press interview
began to trend on the Internet,

681
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,453
and it drew people's attention
to Bad FaMa's trial, but…

682
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,623
And he successfully made people
forget his son's trial.

683
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,957
Is this locked?

684
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,461
This session isn't open to the public.
You can't come in.

685
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,009
Why are you so curious?

686
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,595
Prof. Yang will do a good job.

687
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,765
I heard Prosecutor Bae Sim-won
or someone is invincible.

688
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,434
I hope we only get jurors
who'd rule in Ye-seul's favor.

689
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,647
I hope he makes use of the selection
we came up with after a thorough analysis.

690
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,274
A civil servant in his 50s

691
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,277
with a 28-year-old job-seeking son,
the same age as Yeong-chang.

692
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,487
We should dismiss him.

693
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,739
He'll be more empathetic
toward Ko Yeong-chang.

694
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,325
He has a 26-year-old daughter
who's a flight attendant.

695
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,953
Aren't dads more concerned
about their daughter than their son?

696
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,579
Yes, you might be right.

697
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,122
QUESTION 1: OCCUPATION

698
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,500
Let's keep him here.

699
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,670
An OB-GYN doctor couple in their 50s.

700
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,255
They have a 21-year-old daughter.

701
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,633
They'd be in our favor.

702
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,801
QUESTIONNAIRE

703
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,304
Joon-hwi, where should we sit?

704
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,766
I mean, we came with Prosecutor Jin.

705
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,603
You're working for the prosecutor
so you want to sit there? Go ahead.

706
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,355
It's not that we will. If we can--

707
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,773
You do that.

708
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,526
-Where's Ye-seul?
-She's here. I should go.

709
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,404
Hey, two-timer.

710
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,657
It wouldn't help her
if you're seen with her.

711
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,741
I can go, right?

712
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,493
Just go be with Jin Hyeong-u.

713
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,580
Come on, I didn't mean
I absolutely want to do that.

714
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,760
Ye-seul.

715
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,470
Hey.

716
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,394
Aren't you doing your internship?
Are you allowed to be here?

717
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,734
Let me get you coffee.

718
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,944
No, I'll get it myself.

719
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,580
She shouldn't wear heels, right?

720
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,791
Be thankful that she's not wearing
red lipstick and mascara.

721
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,792
Have you seen Sol A?

722
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,586
What about me?

723
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,087
It's about Bad FaMa.

724
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,380
What about Bad FaMa?

725
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,798
Where's Ye-seul?

726
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,176
Over there.

727
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,310
-Hello.
-Hello.

728
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,227
Hey.

729
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,938
Good luck on your internships.

730
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,233
When you have time,
you should come and watch the trials.

731
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,151
Okay.

732
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,071
How many interns are here from our school?

733
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,281
-A total of seven, ma'am.
-I see.

734
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,493
So what's your internship like?

735
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,577
EXEMPTIONS

736
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,705
Do any of these exemptions apply to you?

737
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,208
How old are you?

738
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,293
I'm 74.

739
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,546
You don't have to do this
if you're over 70.

740
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,008
It'll be really tough for you to sit there

741
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,593
all day long.

742
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,928
All day long?

743
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,513
Yes, all day long.

744
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,974
Yes, sir.

745
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,518
I can't do it.

746
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,727
All right.

747
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,813
How do I become this juror or whatever?

748
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,943
I'm not kidding. How do I become one?

749
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,195
You have to raise your chances.

750
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,699
My 7-year-old daughter

751
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,868
has a grade 1 disability
due to brain lesions,

752
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,954
and she is unable to move on her own.

753
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,790
-I asked my mother to look after her--
-Goodness.

754
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,084
You should go be with your daughter.

755
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,462
Excuse me, Candidate 37, please be quiet.

756
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,630
Yes, okay.

757
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,841
DEFENSE COUNSEL

758
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,926
Make sure you get Candidate 37!

759
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,060
INFORMATION ON JURY CANDIDATES

IN SESSION

765
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,090
Don't be disappointed
if you don't get chosen at first.

766
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,305
Do you know anyone who has suffered
or caused grievous bodily harm?

767
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,435
Her fiancé's mother was hit by a car
then became paraplegic.

768
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,229
It's grievous bodily harm.
The prosecution will choose her.

769
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,148
Let's avoid her.

770
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,066
My boyfriend's mother was hit by a car.

771
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,818
We have much to do for the wedding,

772
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,197
but he makes me do everything
using his mother as an excuse.

773
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,700
If her future mother-in-law is disabled,
she'll be more annoyed.

774
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,203
"Why did she get into an accident?"

775
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,496
She's on our side.

776
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,747
I see.

777
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,667
His mother must be heartbroken
for taking up her son's time.

778
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,668
Sorry?

779
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,963
My nephew fought with a thief

780
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,382
then was imprisoned
for making him lose his sight.

781
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,676
If he tried to stop a thief
from coming in,

782
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,929
he might think imprisonment was unfair.

783
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,056
He probably claimed self-defense.

784
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,017
-Do you think his punishment is unfair?
-One second.

785
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,729
He said the investigation was fair.

786
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,191
He should be punished
if he made him lose his sight.

787
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,402
But imprisonment doesn't seem fair
since it was a thief,

788
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,820
so I think probation sounds fair.

789
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,490
You're right.
Then he won't agree with self-defense.

790
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,993
It might've been different
if it were his son.

791
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,370
Ye-seul is a stranger.

792
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,704
QUESTIONNAIRE

793
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,126
Among assault, injury, fraud,
sexual assault, murder,

794
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,087
and attempted murder,

795
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,257
which crime do you believe
is not punished harshly enough?

796
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,842
It's sexual assault, isn't it?

797
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,469
She's right. It's rape.

798
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,806
Look, the question asked
what she thinks of criminal punishment.

799
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,684
She said it's too light
then put "rape" in brackets, too.

800
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,605
Please!

801
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,274
Please make it.

802
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,737
It's not light.

803
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,366
Criminal punishment for sexual assault
is as severe as that of murder.

804
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,661
Trespassing upon a residence and rape
get you 8 to 13 years in prison

805
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,746
and murder gets you 10 to 16 years.

806
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,749
I think he studied a bit of law.

807
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,546
"How good are you at persuading others
at meetings and work

808
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,214
to agree with your opinions?"

809
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,299
He said he's very good.

810
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,094
He's a wild card.

811
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,430
What do you think
has the weakest punishment?

812
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,889
Assault and injury, of course.

813
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,850
And it's not indicted upon objection.

814
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,811
You don't get punished
once you settle the case.

815
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,062
What makes no sense is

816
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,565
how domestic violence
can't be indicted upon objection.

817
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,319
JURY SELECTION BOX

818
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,198
Defense counsel, any questions?

819
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,617
No, Your Honor.

820
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,909
PROSECUTION

821
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,539
The prosecution and the defense counsel
will now make requests

822
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,542
to have candidates evaded
for reasons and no reasons.

823
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,210
APPLICATION FOR CHALLENGE FOR REASONS

824
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,671
PROSECUTION

825
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,214
APPLICATION FOR CHALLENGE

826
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,842
2, 18, 24 TO BE EVADED

827
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,731
The number 2, number 18,

828
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:08,111
and number 24 candidates
are dismissed from their candidacy.

829
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,203
JURY SELECTION BOX

830
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,458
-Number 38.
-Yes.

831
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,586
-Number 5.
-Yes.

832
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,881
Number 37.

833
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,217
Yes! I'm right here.

834
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,848
Number 37, you seem to have hurt your leg.
Will you be all right?

835
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,975
There's not a problem.

836
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,528
I have a question
for candidates 5, 37, and 38.

837
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,238
Let's say

838
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,783
my girlfriend cheated on me
while she was dating me,

839
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,993
then I asked her to break up with me.

840
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,955
But she couldn't accept it
and ended up causing grievous damage

841
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,457
while she continuously pestered me.

842
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,837
Should I request
to have her severely punished?

843
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,380
Or should I ask for mercy?

844
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,800
If you were once in love with her,
you should ask for mercy.

845
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,344
What are you talking about?

846
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,807
By the way,
how did you end up dating a girl like her?

847
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,477
Don't worry.

848
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,688
You won't have to ask
for a severe punishment.

849
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,316
The law will make sure
she gets punished for what she did.

850
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,402
Isn't that right?

851
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,281
Exactly. A man needs to date a good woman.

852
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,284
I also think what she did
is too cruel to plead for mercy.

853
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,994
Yes, that's exactly what I said.

854
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,538
Okay, please maintain order.

855
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,040
Defense counsel, questions?

856
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,292
I don't have any.

857
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,962
And I will continue to ask no questions.

858
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:01,558
Candidates 5, 7, 11, 37, 38,

859
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:06,271
46, 58, and 76

860
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,106
are chosen as the jury.

861
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,236
In case one of the jurors

862
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,073
is unable to carry out their duty
due to sudden illnesses and so on,

863
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,659
we will select a reserve juror.

864
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,995
According to Article 31.4

865
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,664
of the Act on Citizen Participation
in Criminal Trials,

866
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,251
I will not disclose
who the reserve juror is.

867
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,797
The selection process is concluded.

868
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,299
Drink some.

869
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,595
Your trial will begin soon.

870
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,430
You'll have a tough time in there.

871
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,724
Brace yourself.

872
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,779
It's not your fault
that Ko Yeong-chang ended up like this.

873
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,617
You had to be examined for rape
because of him.

874
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,036
Just remember that.

875
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,461
The prosecutor offered to suspend
his indictment.

876
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,423
Don't try to stop me.

877
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,676
I don't know about you,
but I can at least talk.

878
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,803
I examined Ye-seul
against the president's order

879
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,471
and even came here as a witness.

880
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,556
Go ahead.

881
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:28,979
It wasn't easy for me
to appear here as a witness.

882
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:34,526
If you can be found innocent
without an account from his witness,

883
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,362
I don't want him to stand there.

884
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,323
-Ju-yeong.
-I want to shut his mouth

885
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,950
and get his indictment suspended.

886
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,953
Don't mind her.

887
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,830
She's just frustrated, that's all.

888
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,625
I heard you're a certified
digital forensic examiner.

889
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,919
I am.

890
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:58,258
Could I find out the hour
in which my client had seen this video?

891
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,135
Until the hearing ends.

892
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,180
Professor,
please don't let him be a witness…

893
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,856
DON'T FORGET THIS LONG NIGHT WE HAD

894
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,899
DO AS I SAY
LOVE YOU

895
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:20,030
JEON YE-SEUL'S JURY TRIAL BEGINS

896
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,459
Please.

897
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,505
Dear members of the jury,

898
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,217
in accordance
with Article 27.4 of the Constitution,

899
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,595
we hold to the presumption of innocence.

900
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,933
Which means the defendant of this trial
is presumed to be innocent

901
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,935
until she is found guilty.

902
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,397
Therefore, the defendant has
no obligation to prove her innocence.

903
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,275
The prosecutors must prove
she's guilty as charged

904
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,612
only to the extent
that will not arouse reasonable suspicion.

905
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,199
What the heck is he saying?

906
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:08,787
I request the members of the jury
to rule on her case

907
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,624
solely on the evidence presented
and investigated in this court

908
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,460
according to the Principle of Adjudication
Based on Evidence,

909
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,587
Article 307 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

910
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,465
You must rule on her
solely on the evidence…

911
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,133
BAD FAMA'S JURY TRIAL BEGINS

912
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,927
…presented and accepted in this court.

913
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,187
Man, this is as good as a closed trial.

914
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,022
It's Ko Hyeong-su's power.

915
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,440
Everyone is at Bad FaMa's.

916
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,025
The defendant, Jeon Ye-seul,

917
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,654
had been dating the victim
for three years.

918
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:47,325
They both aspired to get accepted
to Hankuk Law School in the year 2020,

919
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,829
but only the defendant was accepted,
not the victim.

920
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,789
After her enrollment,

921
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,709
the defendant did not have enough time
to meet with the victim

922
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,419
due to the murderous amount of studies.

923
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,171
She had something going on
with a guy in her study group.

924
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,923
Doesn't that mean she two-timed him?

925
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:09,681
The victim, Ko Yeong-chang, found out
she had been two-timing him.

926
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,726
On December 5th, 2020, around 9:00 p.m.,

927
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,729
he asked her to break up with him

928
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,856
in the back
of the Hankuk Law School building,

929
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,900
but the defendant
refused to accept their breakup.

930
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,113
The victim, who was drunk,
called her filthy

931
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,784
then tried to delete a video of them
since he wanted to break up.

932
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,121
Then the defendant assaulted the victim
in a fit of anger.

933
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,375
The victim hit his head on the ground
and was grievously injured.

934
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,502
Goodness. Unbelievable.

935
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:46,384
Of course, the defendant probably
did not devise a plan to cause harm.

936
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,137
If only they hadn't grown apart

937
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,182
after the acceptance and rejection
into the school…

938
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,685
They were so deep in love
that they would've been married by now,

939
00:55:56,561 --> 00:56:00,356
so much so that they agreed to film
a video of their private moment together

940
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,524
and cherish it forever.

941
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:10,241
The victim barely escaped death
from a fatal brain injury

942
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,743
and became paraplegic.

943
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,830
Therefore, we applied
Article 258 of the Criminal Code

944
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,000
and indicted her
for causing grievous bodily harm.

945
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,671
What she said isn't her charge
but a big fat lie! A lie!

946
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,756
JUROR

947
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,094
GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM

948
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,181
If it were fun enough to make me laugh,
I would've called it a novel.

949
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,891
But it was pretty lousy.

950
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,269
-Defense counsel.
-I accept the warning.

951
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,200
Before I came into the trial,

952
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,453
my colleague gave me a good nagging.

953
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,832
She said I have to get on your good side.

954
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,254
She suggested that
if you don't find me likable,

955
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,215
my client would suffer or something.

956
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,845
-Is that the case?
-No.

957
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,016
Since I was sitting across from you,

958
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,686
I could see your confusion

959
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,064
when the judge informed you
of the presumption of innocence

960
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,733
and ruling solely
on the evidence presented here.

961
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,280
To put it plainly,
the presumption of innocence is this.

962
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,158
You may remember me from the news

963
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,578
as a defendant on trial
in the law school murder case.

964
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,708
However, I made a special request
to the judiciary

965
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,502
to take up her case as an attorney.

966
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:49,048
They did not hold to any prejudice
and presumed I was innocent

967
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,302
because I haven't been found guilty
at my trial

968
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,472
and accepted my request.

969
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,057
They presented

970
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:02,020
that a defendant shouldn't be treated
as a criminal.

971
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,444
If any of your family or friends
suffered from grievous bodily harm,

972
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,779
would you blindly judge
against the defendant

973
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,907
just because she's charged with that?

974
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,119
Or since a person's life is at stake,

975
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,289
would you try to make a fair judgment
apart from your personal feelings,

976
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,041
solely grounded on the evidence?

977
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,420
If you just nodded,

978
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,132
you understood what it means
to rule only on the evidence presented.

979
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:35,845
There are no jurors who are advantageous
or disadvantageous to the defendant.

980
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,933
There is only advantageous
or disadvantageous evidence.

981
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,728
We just need you to make a decision
solely on the evidence.

982
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:49,776
Even if you know anybody who suffered
from domestic violence or dating abuse,

983
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,986
please do not show
any pity or sympathy for her.

984
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,075
The fact of the incident is this.

985
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,827
The defendant
was in an abusive relationship.

986
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:00,995
The accident happened

987
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,290
as she tried to stop the victim
from spreading their spy cam sex video.

988
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,169
We claim self-defense in accordance
with Article 21 of the Criminal Code.

989
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,340
CRIMINAL CODE ARTICLE 21: SELF-DEFENSE

990
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,182
Is this really his first time
at a jury trial?

991
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,892
It's his first time as counsel.

992
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,978
PROSECUTION

993
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,898
Look at how he turned
all of our hard all-nighters into nothing.

994
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,192
But I really want to give credit
to Attorney Yang.

995
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,321
He had the jury and the judges
completely under control.

996
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,824
Did you see the prosecutors
and Ko's attorneys?

997
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,826
Especially how Prosecutor Jin looked grim.

998
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,165
-Let's go for lunch.
-Yes, sir.

999
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,876
I'll be testifying later.

1000
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,754
There's no need to sit with him
and cause a misunderstanding.

1001
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,797
Let's go.

1002
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,140
-Hello?
-Go.

1003
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,728
What did you say?

1004
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,817
YOUR CASE IS TRANSFERRED
TO THE PROSECUTION

1005
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,236
Prosecutor Jin's case
isn't transferred yet, right?

1006
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,155
It got transferred to be indicted.

1007
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,741
You surprised me.

1008
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,452
Okay.

1009
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,163
So what? They'll acquit in that case.

1010
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,539
That's why you should…

1011
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,249
What?

1012
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,586
You just put a straw in my drink
then expect me to betray Prosecutor Jin?

1013
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,212
You did that to my dad.

1014
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,883
What happened to your dad is…

1015
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,265
Fine, I honestly had no idea
that the toy my son loves so much

1016
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,392
was made by your father.

1017
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,353
-If I had known--
-You know that now.

1018
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,772
So testify that he slipped it to you.

1019
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,023
I can't!

1020
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,485
I can't do it.

1021
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,655
What if my career as a reporter ends?
Will you take responsibility?

1022
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,407
Let the living live on.

1023
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,202
I'll give you something more interesting.

1024
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,707
-What do you think about this?
-Let's talk about it later.

1025
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,000
All right, everyone.

1026
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,712
-Say something.
-We're in front of the sacred court.

1027
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,382
We shouldn't make a fuss here.
Let's do this later.

1028
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,383
-One second!
-Mr. Ko!

1029
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,176
You want to write a piece on Ko?

1030
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,347
I'll help you report huge exclusive news,
Mr. Choi.

1031
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,767
What?

1032
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,523
It's been received very well.

1033
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,026
They're more excited than the time
when you passed the Lee Man-ho Act.

1034
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,071
What about Yeong-chang?

1035
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,740
Attorney Song told you not to worry.

1036
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,575
Tell him to end it soon.

1037
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,953
I'll be at Bad FaMa's court after lunch.

1038
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,100
-Damn you.
-Hey, you!

1039
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,062
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

1040
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,440
You can't do this to me!

1041
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,524
Let go…

1042
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,112
That's not enough to kill him.

1043
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,113
Damn it.

1044
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,659
-Choke him harder!
-Stay away.

1045
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,415
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

1046
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,083
PROSECUTION

1047
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,970
Is the defense counsel not here yet?

1048
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:49,932
Don't come closer.

1049
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,188
Kill him.

1050
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,765
How this ended up in my hands…

1051
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,642
I thought she looked familiar.

1052
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,560
-I never forget a face.
-Tell me!

1053
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,563
For what reason did he make you do that?

1054
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,273
Shouldn't you be suspicious of it?

1055
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,901
Why do you think
Prosecutor Jin attended Ye-seul's trial?

1056
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,069
By chance?

1057
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,906
Actually, the one you stabbed
in the back is not me.

1058
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,825
My apologies.

1059
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,701
The victim wanted to be here,
so I brought him.

1060
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,663
I'll gladly be called a rapist.

1061
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,666
Are you saying you were raped
though you actually had sex with him?

1062
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,085
I resign.

1063
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,920
I can no longer represent Ms. Jeon.

1064
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:05,466
