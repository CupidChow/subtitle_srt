00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,189
APRIL 2016 (4 YEARS AGO)

2
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,108
About my violation
of the Public Official Election Act.

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,777
PROSECUTOR YANG JONG-HOON

4
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,821
That cheeky brat
went to see Yang Jong-hoon.

5
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,451
He won't listen to me.

6
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,038
You'll have to make him listen.

7
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,249
He only associates with you
in the prosecution.

8
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,836
That's the least you can do for me.

9
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,089
And I called

10
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,468
that airhead over.

11
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,639
Hello.

12
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,315
You need to take off your clothes
to work up a sweat.

13
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,776
You said you'd cooperate, so I came.

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,570
According to the accuser, Ms. Kang Dan--

15
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,699
Kang Dan? She's only doing this
to blackmail me for money.

16
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,035
You spread fake news
about your opponent to win--

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,411
Prosecutor Yang.

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,039
Aren't you busy?

19
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,417
You still have a long way to go.

20
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,838
I can't believe
you fell for that young girl's scheme.

21
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,715
Take your clothes off.

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,802
It is rather hot.

23
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,473
I need to see you.

24
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,350
I came to see Assemblyman Ko.

25
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,311
So you told people to spread fake info?

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,981
Let's sweat it out, then.

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,822
Now, give me an answer.

28
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,584
TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY BY THE LAW

29
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,672
Is this Prosecutor Yang's phone?

30
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,639
KANG DAN

31
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,850
KANG DAN

32
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,018
This is Kang Dan.

33
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,987
Isn't this
Prosecutor Yang Jong-hoon's number?

34
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,948
You're Kang Dan?

35
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,868
Hello? Hello? Are you Kang Dan?

36
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,328
It's me, Kang Sol. Hello?

37
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,914
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

38
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,832
Hello? Hello…

39
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,635
The rice is rather firm today. Perfect.

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,928
I'm craving ramyeon now.

41
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,561
How did the trial go?

42
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,396
You should've come see it yourself.

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,524
I'll be a witness for the next trial,
and I've got no time to go twice.

44
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,152
Of course.
Our finals are around the corner.

45
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
So why is Professor Kang Ju-man…

46
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,115
He looks good on camera.

47
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,742
Go ask him. I'm curious too.

48
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,954
Is Sol A really Professor Kang's daughter?

49
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,207
Sol A looks much better in person.
Go ask her yourself.

50
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,293
What I want to say right now is…

51
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,548
may I have a bite?

52
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,175
After you throw in some firm rice.

53
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,969
Man.

54
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,263
CALLS

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,597
CALLING…

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,853
Was that really the Dan I know?

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,899
How did she contact you?

58
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,818
Why is she calling you?

59
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,111
I asked around for her.

60
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,282
I thought I saw her last year
at the Criminal Law Conference

61
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,449
held at Harvard.

62
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,583
You can't complain later.
You said I can have it all.

63
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,003
You aren't the type who asks for a bite.

64
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,629
I do it for ramyeon.

65
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,466
Do you really believe that

66
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,386
she wrote her paper in middle school?

67
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,391
Wasn't she your rival in middle school?
Then you'd know what she can do.

68
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,184
Right.

69
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,064
It'd make much less sense to say
Professor Seo wrote that. How despicable.

70
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,235
"Despicable"?

CEO SEO GI-YEOL KILLS SELF
AMID PROSECUTION

72
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,575
"CEO Seo Gi-yeol of TOYGOODTOY,
a renowned Korean toy company,

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,329
took an extreme measure
during the prosecution investigation.

74
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,915
According to Seoul Jungang Police Station,
Seo was found around 5 p.m.

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,210
in his office
after setting himself on fire.

76
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,463
He was found by his son.

77
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,381
The police found nothing suspicious,

78
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,968
and they considered the fact that
he had been under extreme stress

79
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,262
due to the recent
prosecution investigation,

80
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,598
as likely factors to conclude
he committed suicide."

81
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,518
The son who found his father
burnt to death

82

after the prosecution investigation.

83

That's me.

84
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,862
The prosecutor who interrogated him

85
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,783
was Seo Byung-ju.

86
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,085
Your uncle didn't just kill a kid
with his car.

87
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,879
He disclosed my dad's accusation
and killed him too.

That's what he wrote in his paper.

101
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,618

Please tell me

if there's something I don't know
between you and Dan.

Can you handle it?

107
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,856
Did she leave home

108
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,692
because of what's in that letter?

109
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,736
Further discussion won't help you
get better grades in the finals.

110
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,155
Worry about that first.

You'll have to repeat the year
if you don't pass this test, correct?

00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,549
Yes, I need to pass my classes first.

119
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,762
Shut your mouth
and focus on studying for the finals.

Why did you do that?

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,936
Why do you let people
take this the wrong way?

It's all over.

133
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,627
If she didn't do it, it's all good.

134
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,798
She was only worried about herself

135
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,011
when I mentioned the possibility
of confessing the crime,

136
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,429
but a person died.

137
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,268
And she brazenly said
she didn't plagiarize his paper.

138
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,313
I told her to do that.

139
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,939
-Honey.
-And I did too.

140

That's how people live.

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,865
Everyone else does worse things
then move on and continue to live.

143
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,367
That's not normal!

144
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,745
"Normal."

145
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,875
Professor Kang Ju-man.

146
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,712
In the eyes of your family of judges
who passed the judicial exam at once,

147
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,924
you're the abnormal one.

148
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,717
Didn't you know that?

149
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,639
You should

150
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,643
let your daughter live a normal life.

151
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,981
Stop making a big deal out of this.

152
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,403
Don't say anything stupid to our daughter.

153
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,074
If you really want to,

154
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,159
we'll get some counseling.

To Prosecutor Yang Jong-hoon.

156
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,091
I'm not sure if I could
send this letter to you,

157
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,843
but I still wanted to apologize.

158
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,972
Prosecutor Yang, I promised
to never compromise with injustice,

159
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,683
but I'm sorry
I didn't hold on to my words.

160
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,936
I ended up kneeling down
before filthy money.

You're my son.

My son.

Didn't she get 29 points
during the midterm?

179
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,914
Yes, and I got a D plus
in the first semester.

180
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,583
If you wish, I'll gladly do it.

181
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,506
Who is it?

182
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,051
Ye-seul.

183
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,177
-Sol.
-Come on in.

184
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,059
May I crash here?

185
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,352
Here?

186
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,854
I don't want to sleep alone.

187
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,733
Okay.

188
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,695
You can sleep here.

189
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,822
I have to stay up all night anyway.

190
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,617
We can both lie down.
It's big enough for two.

191
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,997
-What I meant was…
-Okay, sure. Go to sleep.

192
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,957
I need to study some more.

193
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,669
Lie down.

I was worried about you, babe.

00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,153
-My gosh, hey!
-Whoa.

207
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,488
Darn it.

208
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,032

-Whoa, hey!

209
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,076
Darn it. Let me go!

210
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,203

Hey! Darn it.

00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,263
What are you doing? Hey, stop.

213
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,432
Darn it. Let me go. Let go!

214
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,060
Ouch. Let me go, you jerk!

215
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,022
Darn it. Man.

216
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,818
Why was she in her room?

217
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,069
I was really shocked!

218
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm the one who's shocked.

219
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,739
Why were you at the women's dorm?

220
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,492
How did you get into the room
without the student ID…

221
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,788
I gave it to him.

222
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,625
What?

223
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,627
You've been secretly coming in?

224
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,421
She was scared to be alone
after her roommate took a leave.

225
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,133
I should be here for my girl
if she's scared.

226
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,176
Isn't that so, babe?

227
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,053
-I'll report him.
-Joon-hwi.

228
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,721
"Joon-hwi"?

229
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,517
I told you not to be so friendly with him.

230
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,313
You want to report me? Go ahead.

231
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,398
Do it.

232
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,692
This idiot has no idea who I am.

233
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,319
Hey, wait.

234
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,289
Ye-seul gave him a student ID.

235
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,292
If anyone finds out she let him in
and stay the night,

236
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,459
she'll get kicked out.

237
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,670
What can she do? That's the rule.

238
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,922
Hey, just let it go this once

239
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,090
for Ye-seul's sake.

240
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,760
I can't let it go for her sake.
Why do you think she came to your room?

241
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,182
Man, this is so freaking annoying.

242
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,476
Why were you away?
Didn't you know I was coming?

243
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,813
I'm sorry.
I didn't think she'd sleep there.

244
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,400
-So you weren't at another guy's room?
-Yeong-chang.

245
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,277
Why are you avoiding me?

246
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,613
I wasn't. I got anxious and scared.

247
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,782
I thought you'd come by
only once in a while

248
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,034
when I gave you the ID.

249
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,785
If you come by every single night,

250
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,454
I'll get kicked out.

251
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,039
Let them, and move in with me.

252
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,457
Yeong-chang.

253
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,877
Give me the ID.

254
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,510
This is the last time I let you slide.

255
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,054
Thanks so much, Sol.

256
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,138
Let's go.

257
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,685
You can't leave like this.

258
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,701
I'm sorry, Sol.

259
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,828
You couldn't even sleep.

260
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,914
I'm really sleepy.

261
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,085
Don't take this the wrong way,

262
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,963
but your boyfriend

263
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,048
seems a little dangerous.

264
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,510
To be honest, not a little, but very.

265
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,679
It's not like that.

266
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm worried about you.

267
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,726
Obsession isn't love.

268
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,522
I said it's not like that.
Go back to sleep.

269
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,693
This is the last time I'll let this go.

270
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,822
I had a tough time
trying to convince Joon-hwi.

271
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,339
MISSED CALLS FROM MY HUBBY

272
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,935
Write down that you'll take
civil and legal responsibility

273
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,228
if this happens again.

274

Aren't you a law student?

275
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,734
These notes have zero validity in court.

276
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,569
But it can be used as evidence

277
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,988
to prove you're a repeat offender.

278
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,035
I can't write it. And I won't.

279
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,871
If you knew who I am--

280
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,372
You should be scared. I'd know.

281
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,460
If I tell people whose son went
snooping around at a girls' dorm,

282
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,046
your dad's name will go viral first.

283
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,380
You jerk.

284
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,890
Say it.

285
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,016
Say what?

286
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,604
Look back on what you did as you write.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR OFFICE

Going down.

289
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,329
Prosecutor Jin
didn't disclose your suspected crime.

290
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,831
Lee Man-ho was the source of his article.

291

PROSECUTOR LEE HAN-JU

292
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,962
Hey.

293
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,382
You must be here in anger
since the police found me innocent.

294
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,054
You must have lots of spare time,
but you didn't have to come.

295
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,057
You won't be able to lose your anger.

296
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,103
The evidence you turned in
was all rejected.

297
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,237
How could I lie to you?

298
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,908
Reporters asked for my take on the reason
why Seo was killed by Yang Jong-hoon.

299
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,744
I mean, they asked me.

300
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,622
So I just shared my opinion. That's all.

301
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,292
May I go now?

302
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,425
I checked with him again,

303
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,469
and he admitted to it.

304
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,596
But Jin said he disclosed
my suspected crime

305
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,431
on the ride to the spot inspection.

306
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,184
I turned in the prison guard's testimony.

307
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,520
Prosecutor Jin's side turned in

308
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,856
the testimony of the other guard
who was there.

309
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,399
He said he took it as a joke.

310
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,694
That you took his joke
a little too seriously.

311
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,904
Man, a joke, my foot.

312
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
He always manages to escape.

313
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,827
It was a stretch on your part.

314
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,414
In this situation,
unless some reporters come out and say

315
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,583
their source was Prosecutor Jin,

316
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,169
you can't get him indicted.

317
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,260
Hot Americano with an extra shot, please.

318
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,055
I'll take one with one shot less,
so put that one in his.

319
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,432
I'll pay for both.

320
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,102
Thanks for the coffee.

321
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,440
Well, I shared my blood with you,
so I guess I deserve some coffee.

322
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,319
What's the deal you made
with Prosecutor Jin?

323
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,989
What deal?

324
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,951
He's the first jerk
who locked me up behind bars.

325
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,661
Why would I make a deal with him?

326
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,001
It wasn't rape back then.

327
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,419
It was for organ trafficking.

328
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,924
I shudder whenever I hear his name.

329
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,509
Do you think I wanted to help him?

330
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,680
It's just because that prosecutor
asked me to tell the truth.

331
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:22,437
Man, I shouldn't have babbled
even if those reporters pestered me.

332
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,609
I enjoyed your trial.

333
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,320
You seemed to be
more into something else than the trial.

334
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,447
Don't lay a hand on my student.

335
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,033
Lay a hand on her?

336
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,868
I was just asking for a favor.

337
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,539
That girl has

338
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,042
an older sister.

339
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,880
And I really have to meet her sister.

340
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,635
You have to meet her sister?

341
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,352
Did you have to go that far?

342
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,314
You were almost spying on him,
filming and recording his voice.

343
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,276
I looked through everything all night,
and my impression is that…

344
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,152
COMPLAINT

345
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,159
…it wasn't my uncle.

346
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,330
That's what you want to believe.

347
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,292
I respect your reasonable doubt.
I would've done the same.

348
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,543
I'll look for evidence

349
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,421
to break your suspicion
and back up my argument.

350
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,342
By the way,
does Professor Yang know about this?

351
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,637
Yes.

352
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,686
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

353
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:56,906
Ouch. Gosh. My butt hurts.

354
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,869
Darn it.

355
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,751
Aw, man.

356
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,172
No way!

357
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,490
KICS: PROGRESS OF CRIMINAL ACCUSATION

358
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,159
You even wrote the complaint for me.

359
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,121
That just proved Article 126
of the Criminal Code is useless.

360
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,293
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

361
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,253
Okay.

362
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,049
-You may go.
-Sorry?

363
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,510
You knew it wouldn't be easy.

364
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,596
You can't learn that in class.

365
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,265
You have class, right?

366
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,110
Goodness, is this the Ji-ho
who can't lose a second?

367
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,111
What are you doing?

368
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,282
You're popular for a professor
without a class.

369
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,452
Goodness, I would've been at your trial

370
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,538
if it hadn't been for my baby.

371
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,958
Right, I heard Kang Sol
is the vice dean's daughter.

372
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:35,130
It's a surprise that
it wasn't Sol B, but Sol A.

373
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,799
I heard it's Sol A.

374
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,969
Everyone at school knows
because of this photo.

375
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,637
Take a look.

376
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,598
WITNESS CHANGES TESTIMONY
IN LAW SCHOOL MURDER TRIAL

377
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,144
With the plagiarism and all,
it'd be way more problematic if it was B.

378
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,354
-It's B.
-What?

379
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,480
His daughter.

380
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,565
It's Sol B?

381
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,401
Wait, one second.

382
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,862
Goodness, then the plagiarism…

383
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,490
Was he involved with her plagiarism?

384
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,785
So that's why.

385
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,620
That's why he wanted to quit.

386
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,710
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

387
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,337
Your daughter was accepted here

388
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,131
and she got to take your lecture

389
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,050
after you talked to the school
and asked for understanding.

390
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,218
This is unnecessary.

391
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,261
DEAN OH JEONG-HUI

392
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,596
Please reconsider.

393
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,810
I'm sorry.

394
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,022
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

395
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,617
It's me, Professor Yang.

396
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,121
The vice dean doesn't seem to have
enough strength to rip his resignation.

397
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,917
I should do that.

398
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,634
Ms. Oh.

399
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,513
Please help Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su
hold a successful special lecture.

400
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,728
We're practically forced to be here.

401
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,188
A special lecture, not class?

402
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,523
Is Assemblyman Ko that big?

403
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,400
Prof. Jung wants his connection
before he runs for presidency.

404
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,570
I'll be punished for offending him
if I skip this, right?

405
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,239
Offending someone isn't a crime.

406
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,865
-Where are you going?
-Out.

407
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,992
He'll mark you down as absent
if you skip it!

408
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,953
I can't believe how confident he is.

409
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,205
Go on. I have to do something.

410
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,706
Wait, you too?

411
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,335
Did you see that? Only students
with good grades can cut like this.

412
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,170
I'm so jealous. Gosh.

413
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:43,258
Anyway, Seung-jae hasn't been
talking as much lately.

414
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,676
It seems he has changed.

415
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,303
Seung-jae has never talked much.

416
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,890
-To me, Ye-seul seems to have changed.
-Me?

417
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,309
I haven't even seen her around lately.

418
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,146
Don't worry.
You'll see me more often starting now.

419
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,027
You can go first.

420
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,659
I see. She was busy
getting lovey-dovey with him.

421
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,370
I told you to just forget about her.

422
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,206
Don't be shot down.
You should ask her out.

423
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,250
Come on, she's seeing someone.

424
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,127
Go do anything if it isn't illegal.

425
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,005
-What? What if someone steals your guy?
-She'll die.

426
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,090
Gosh, speak for yourself.

427
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,720
Just take her from that kid.

428
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,930
That kid? He's someone's precious son.

429
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,765
Yes, a precious kid to someone.

430
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,726
I see, that's what you meant.

431
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,645
-Just as how you're Prof. Kang's kid?
-What?

432
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,814
Why is he here? He doesn't even go here.

433
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,942
-He's getting ready to study here.
-What?

434
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,237
So he's a kid who's in preparation.

435
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,365
Let's make it quick
since we have a lecture.

436
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,784
I gave it a thought.

437
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,954
On that day, the teaching assistant

438
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,875
left my laptop in front of the cart
to leave it at Prof. Kang's office.

439
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,836
Where's Professor Kang Ju-man's class?

440
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,841
Then you took the laptop
that was at the very front.

441
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,345
I got those confused.

442
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,681
It was the same model as mine.

443
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,601
Your laptop is the same model as mine?

444
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,937
It isn't.

445
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,773
Well, that day,

446
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,692
my laptop was acting funny,

447
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,362
so I brought my wife's.

448
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,989
Her laptop is the same model as yours.

449
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,909
In that case, the laptop which the TA left

450
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,953
at Prof. Kang's office thinking it's mine,

451
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,955
should've been your wife's laptop.

452
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,292
Give me an answer.

453
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,757
Why wasn't it your wife's laptop,

454
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,134
but Prof. Yang Jong-hoon's laptop?

455
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,147
-Did you turn the power on?
-Yes.

456
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,899
Mr. Choi Jung-hyeok?

457
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,819
Han Joon-hwi, I called you.

458
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,905
Right. Yes.

459
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,160
So you're Mr. Seo Byung-ju's nephew?

460
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,080
Yes, I've seen you before.

461
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,457
Really? Have we met?

462
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,210
When did we meet?

463
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,671
In front of my uncle's place.

464
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,173
Don't you remember

465
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,844
asking him to help you
leak this information out?

466
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,685
CARCINOGENS DETECTED IN T COMPANY'S TOY

467
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,061
REPORTER CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

468
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,739
HAEWON DAILY, REPORTER CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

469
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,948
Nice to meet you.

470
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,992
SPECIAL LECTURE
BY ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

471
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,037
I got the privilege to stand before you
here at Hankuk Law School,

472
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:04,208
the brightest future law officials
of our nation.

473
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,002
It's a great honor,

474
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,380
yet my heart breaks as I stand here.

475
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,548
Yangcrates is here.

476
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,800
SPECIAL LECTURE

477
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,677
Because my close friend, Seo Byung-ju,

478
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,598
was brutally murdered
at the mock court he helped build

479
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,435
through his donation.

480
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,230
How could
"Hankuk University Law School Murderer"

481
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,400
become the most searched word?

482
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm sure all of you were appalled as well.

483
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,951
Since the case is still in trial,
I'll refrain from mentioning it.

484
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,706
However, he was once a role model
to many junior prosecutors.

485
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,918
So I still can't believe

486
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,797
he was involved
in a drunken hit-and-run incident,

487
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,382
then went on to make a deal
with a sex offender

488
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,137
to let him off with feeble-mindedness.

489
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,849
What's ironic is

490
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,519
I proposed the Lee Man-ho Act

491
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:06,896
and passed it

492
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,316
to revise the article
on feeble-mindedness.

493
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,824
I'd like to give you a big hand
for bringing a revision on that article.

494
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,326
Bravo!

495
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,671
You don't have to give me a hand.

496
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,506
I only did my work

497
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,218
-as one of legislators.
-Did you come up with the idea

498
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,055
for the Lee Man-ho Act?

499
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:44,976
Of course.

500
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,312
From what I know, a student
at Hankuk University made the suggestion,

501
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,981
then you only picked it up.

502
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,158
That did not happen.

503
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,492
So do you not know her?

504
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,911
She was in your campaign,

505
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,914
then reported your violation
of the Public Official Election Act.

506
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,041
Prof. Yang.

507
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,127
Sit down. Just sit.

508
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,340
There must be a big misunderstanding.

509
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:22,430
I understand how shocked you are
for standing in court as a murderer.

510
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,681
Don't.

511
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,353
I'm used to standing in court,
but I'm appalled by the fact

512
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,566
students who'd be studying
the Criminal Code are forced to be here.

513
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,859
Forced to be here?

514
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,861
I decided that

515
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,239
his lecture
is as valuable as my lecture, so--

516
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,034
It's a shame that
your lectures are only worth that much.

517
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,537
This was my class.

518
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,332
So the class should be irreplaceable
like mine.

519
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,967
Has he gone insane?

520
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,931
-That jerk!
-Yeong-chang, calm down.

521
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,307
Let me go.

522
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,100
-Yeong-chang, calm down.
-Calm down?

523
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,436
How can you tell me to calm down?

524
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,105
Did you hear what he said
to your future father-in-law?

525
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,398
He's a professor!

526
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,108
He's your professor.

527
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,904
-I haven't been accepted.
-You'll get in next year.

528
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,113
I know you'll make it.

529
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,907
What if I don't?

530
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,202
Why? You want to leave me?

531
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,663
That's not what I meant.
Even I got accepted.

532
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,997
But you're smarter, so--

533
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,207
Exactly!

534
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,960
If you got accepted, why can't I get in?

535
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,254
That's why
my father treats me like an idiot.

536
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,174
-Ye-seul.
-Yeong-chang.

537
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,718
I love you so much.

538
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,721
You aren't allowed to treat me
like a nobody.

539
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,223
Darn it!

540
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,225
Are you crazy?

541
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,060
Ouch. Darn it.

542
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,647
Ye-seul, why do you let him
trample all over you?

543
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,775
Hey, who do you think you are
to meddle in our relationship?

544
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,320
You go keep your butt out of pain.

545
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,656
Ye-seul.

546
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,286
Where's Prof. Yang?

547
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,247
How does he know my butt hurts?

548
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,833
I never told anyone about it.

549
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,046
What are you saying?

550
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:24,593
I mean, I guess it's very stressful
for you to stay away from lecturing.

551
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,179
You wouldn't usually do that
in front of students.

552
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,348
What about you applauding like crazy?

553
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,142
I thought of getting into politics

554
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,060
just to revise
the article on feeble-mindedness.

555
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,314
But thanks to him,
I didn't have to do that.

556
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,274
Right.

557
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,902
What's this about a student
who suggested the Lee Man-ho Act?

558
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,865
And a whistle-blower
of the Public Official Election Act?

559
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,659
Everything you said was very dangerous.

560
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,828
I'm sure
it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing.

561
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,247
It's unlike you to give someone an excuse.

562
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,125
-An excuse?
-Yes.

563
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,545
An excuse for Assemblyman Ko
to sue you for slander.

564
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,505
Do you think he will?

565
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,631
What?

566
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,301
You sound like you want him to.

567
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,763
Is that it? Was that bait?

568
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,682
Goodness, it was bait.

569
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,683
But why?

570
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,812
Hey. I'll see you at the Copy Room.

571
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,483
Why should Assemblyman Ko take that bait?

572
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,904
Gosh, he never tells me anything.

573
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,075
Come to your room right now.

574
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,204
Didn't I tell you
to dismiss Yang Jong-hoon immediately?

575
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,415
Who do you think
helped you become president?

576
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,626
Yet you fail to control him
and bring me shame?

577
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,752
Ouch.

578
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,087
I'm sorry.

579
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,880
Are you all right, sir?

580
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,508
Hey, wait.

581
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,218
Yes?

582
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,767
Are you a student here?

583
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,352
Yes, I am.

584
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,729
-What's your name?
-Me?

585
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,564
I'm sorry, but why?

586
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,067
Where are you?

587
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:04,902
I'm Kang Sol.

588
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,489
Hurry up and come. It's really weird.

589
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,282
Yes, to your room.

590
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,909
QUESTIONS: KANG SOL

591
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,620
I brought witness questions
for your next trial.

592
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,916
You have an office.
Why do we always meet here?

593
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,253
Tapping devices hear you by day,
and spy cams see you by night.

594
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,297
He's the "Law School Murderer".

595
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,091
He's the biggest troublemaker,

596
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,176
so who knows what he has in his office?

597
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,430
When it comes to trouble,
you're the biggest troublemaker.

598
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,224
Look, you have tapping devices
and spy cams.

599
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,600
And speakers.

600
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,395
It's starting to feel like
you're slandering me.

601
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,564
Who knows what's planted here?

602
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,648
Don't worry.

603
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,861
Ta-da.

604
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,156
Yes, you're dirty.

605
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,366
-Goodness. Unbelievable.
-See?

606
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,742
What is it?

607
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,204
I need to check something.

608
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,790
Check what?

609
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,313
Hey, goodness.

610
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,898
I got you, you jerk.

611
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,944
You're finished now.

612
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,362
You're dead.

613
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,825
Did you know he had been recording you?

614
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,870
Darn it.

615
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,671
I don't feel very safe
about letting Kang Sol A take the stand.

616
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,090
What about her?
She's definitely on his side.

617
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,510
That's why I feel more anxious.

618
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,930
She might get emotional
and be led by the prosecutor's questions.

619
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,306
I'm more anxious about you.

620
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,975
Why do you have no confidence
and keep asking your client?

621
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,144
I never asked him too many questions.

622
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,356
And it's not that I don't know. I do know.

623
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,317
I wanted to make sure of everything,
so I'm just checking.

624
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,320
You'd ruin his trial
if you decided to check twice.

625
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:17,243
Anyway, we didn't approve of Kang Sol B
as our witness.

626
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:21,080
So why didn't the prosecutor
request to have her as a witness?

627
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,750
Try to put your head to use
before you check with him.

628
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,379
Vice Dean and Kang Sol B
saw the sugar packet at the crime scene.

629
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,590
The prosecution wants the judges
to drop the sugar packet.

630
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,343
Why would they call Kang Sol B
and make her bear witness?

631
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,263
But I have to ask her
if she saw the sugar packet.

632
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,431
That's why they didn't want her.

633
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,601
Then we should have her as a witness.

634
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,728
You're very quick, aren't you?

635
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,855
-I'll make the request, okay?
-No.

636
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,066
Why not?

637
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,152
I don't think
they'll trust the vice dean's testimony.

638
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,779
So we should get her.

639
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,531
I won't have her in the court.

640
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,578
PRINT, COPY, BOOKBINDING

641
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,633
I thought you'd have me as a witness.

642
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:17,720
Did you find out

643
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,306
why my laptop
was at the vice dean's office

644
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,432
instead of yours?

645
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,561
Even if you found out the reason,
you wouldn't tell me.

646
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,273
If I were to have you as a witness,

647
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,776
I'd also ask you about the laptop
as well as the sugar packet.

648
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,820
But you won't tell the truth.

649
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,905
You won't have me at the witness stand

650
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,491
because I may be charged with perjury?

651
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,456
Because you may not be charged
with perjury.

652
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,794
You'll tell a lie as if it's the truth
even after the oath

653
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,547
yet leave enough room
to avoid getting charged.

654
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,300
I swore none of my students

655
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,470
will turn out to be
someone who takes advantage of the law.

656
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,265
So I can't let you taint my career.

657
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,189
Let's meet over there
once you're ready to tell the truth.

658
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,316
I want to start

659
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:16,195
from the moment you went to see Prof. Seo
on the day of the incident.

660
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,126
Plagiarism.

661
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,672
It won't be easy to disclose the truth.

662
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,340
I understand.

663
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,969
You probably think everything will be over
the moment you admit it.

664
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,308
But no.

665
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,478
The moment
you choose to gloss over your fault,

666
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,189
the door to damnation opens up.

667
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,238
Like I told your father,

668
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,949
before I make an issue of this,
you should--

669
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,158
What could I possibly…

670
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,495
do?

671
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,617
What are you doing here?

672
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,536
Hey.

673
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,580
Getting some air.

674
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,914
I see.

675
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,458
Gosh.

676
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,836
I should be keeping my mouth shut
and studying.

677
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,838
That's how I can save myself.

678
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,923
But I see a million things to meddle in.

679
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,010
What drives me crazy the most is

680
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,845
I shouldn't ask though I'm curious.

681
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,889
Why can't you do that?

682
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,975
If I found out now,
I'd probably break down,

683
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,810
then I'll ruin all my tests.

684
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,271
I'll be finished
once I do badly on the finals.

685
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,773
Right, flunking out.

686
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,401
-That's not good.
-No.

687
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,362
I worked so hard to get in here.

688
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,159
There's something I'm curious about, too.

689
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,496
You're the A-plus guy
who doesn't have to study.

690
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,831
-If you're curious--
-May I ask?

691
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,127
Why did Prof. Kang bear false witness?

692
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:38,921
Well…

693
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,342
Does this have something to do with Sol B?

694
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,220
One second.

695
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,682
Yes, professor.

696
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,601
Right now?

697
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,605
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

698
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,319
I greatly appreciate your help.
Thank you very much.

699
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,155
We were just doing our job.

700
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,157
I'm glad we were able to help.

701
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,453
That's also the reason why
this Legal Clinic is here.

702
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,539
She's here.

703
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,458
-Goodness, hello.
-Hello.

704
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,586
Thank you.
It's all thanks to your interpretation.

705
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,422
Her indictment might be suspended.

706
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,423
Suspended?

707
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,926
I was fined last time.

708
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,971
It's all thanks to you.

709
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,556
Don't say that.

710
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,599
I only did as my professor told me.

711
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,686
-That professor is here.
-I see.

712
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,939
Hello, thank you.

713
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,442
Thanks to you, she won't be fined.
Her indictment might be suspended.

714
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,029
Didn't they tell you
to stop running the website?

715
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,323
How did you know?

716
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,075
Wait, they had a condition?

717
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,619
Gosh, I knew it.

718
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,540
That's the reason why
I came to see you again.

719
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,543
You don't want to stop running it, right?

720
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,169
No.

721
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,214
I don't run it for my benefit anyway.

722
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,050
But it'd be much better
if your indictment were to be suspended.

723
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,304
Just let them indict you,
then be found innocent in court.

724
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,472
-Sorry?
-"Just let them indict you"?

725
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,226
Have you been indicted?

726
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,605
She can be found innocent in court?

727
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,774
-Who's going to make it happen? You?
-Sorry?

728
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,860
-Can you be responsible?
-No, I meant…

729
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,446
You spoke words
you can't be responsible for.

730
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,949
There's a need to bring up this issue

731
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,076
since unpaid child support
is a major problem.

732
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,329
So you're using a trial
to manipulate opinions?

733
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,830
Who taught you to do that?

734
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,834
-Was it you?
-Prof. Yang.

735
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:41,960
I'm sorry.

736
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,589
Please disregard what she said.

737
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,925
I'm sorry.
I spoke up without thinking it through.

738
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,053
No, it's all because of me.

739
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,016
Just repeat the year instead.

740
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,185
You didn't learn anything from me.

741
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,519
You better retake it.

742
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,777
Ouch.

743
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,071
What's wrong?

744
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,490
He wants me to repeat the year? Nonsense.

745
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,450
Someone told you to flunk out?

746
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,327
Just go on your way.

747
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,829
Let's get ready for Prof. Yang's trial.

748
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,748
-Make some time--
-Go do it alone.

749
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,083
I don't have to do this.

750
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,584
You suggested we do this.

751
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,919
I'm not going to do it.

752
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,880
Prof. Yang is even eviler than Lee Man-ho.

753
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,048
He's the devil.

754
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,177
-And the trial?
-I'm not going.

755
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,846
If you fail to appear, there's a fine--

756
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,139
I'll just pay the fine.

757
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,476
You won't see me, Kang Sol,
at that witness stand.

758
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,811
"Oath.

759
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,812
I solemnly affirm

760
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,981
that I will tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

761
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,401
I understand that
I would be committing perjury

762
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,069
if I said anything untruthful."

763
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,454
Your footprint wasn't found on the scene,

764
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,748
but you volunteered to be a testifier.

765
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,209
-Yes.
-Why?

766
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,045
Because I was sure
Prof. Yang was innocent, but…

767
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,630
But?

768
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,426
To be honest, I'm not so sure anymore.

769
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,389
I really wish I could say that.

770
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,306
WITNESS

771
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,851
But I'm still 100 percent sure
he didn't kill him.

772
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,018
Witness.

773
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,563
I really didn't want to be sitting here,

774
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,023
but I had no other choice
because I'm that sure.

775
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,692
Why is she so pouty?

776
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,485
She has all the reasons to pout.

777
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,237
But she still showed up.

778
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,114
I don't quite understand.

779
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,324
He died of methamphetamine overdose.

780
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,534
The defendant's fingerprints

781
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:41,037
were found on the meth sachet,
the coffee cup, and lid.

782
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,789
How can you be sure he's innocent?

783
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,293
Even if his fingerprints were found
on the meth sachet and the coffee cup,

784
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,755
it's not like anybody saw Prof. Yang
put the meth in his coffee, right?

785
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,590
It's not like there's an eyewitness.

786
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,758
Only I ask questions.

787
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,010
You'll just answer.

788
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,344
Okay.

789
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,680
Witness.

790
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,767
You were sent
to a juvenile detention center

791
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,643
for assault back in high school, correct?

792
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,024
And the defendant was the prosecutor.

793
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,609
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

794
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,904
-Really?
-Objection--

795
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,573
-Objection!
-The witness cannot make an objection.

796
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,327
Your Honor,

797
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:21,870
I have no idea why

798
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,956
the prosecutor brought up something
that has nothing to do with this trial.

799
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,124
No.

800
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,543
Her conviction
of the defendant's innocence

801
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,796
is contrary to the evidence
proving his guilt.

802
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,965
This question is necessary
to break the credibility of her testimony.

803
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,384
Continue.

804
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,762
Back then,

805
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:42,432
the defendant ignored the victim's request
to have you punished severely

806
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,560
and punished you lightly
to the juvenile detention center

807
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,437
instead of criminal punishment.

808
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,773
Well, the victims were--

809
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,191
Please answer yes or no.

810
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,070
-Yes.
-And you are taking his side today

811
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,239
because he showed you mercy, correct?

812
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,574
-I am not taking his side.
-Answer yes or no.

813
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,784
Yes…

814
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,495
or no is not necessary
when the witness answers.

815
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,458
Would you still be sure of his innocence
if you were sentenced criminally,

816
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,168
in other words, more severely?

817
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,003
No, right?

818
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,964
-I'm not sure if--
-That's all.

819
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,349
What?

820
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,059
About four years ago,

821
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,979
do you remember how
the CEO of TOYGOODTOY killed himself?

822
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,189
A few days ago,

823
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,150
Seo Byung-ju's nephew
came and asked me about it.

824
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,402
The witness right there?

825
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,528
Yes.

826
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:38,905
Witness.

827
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,365
WITNESS

828
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,076
Why are you smiling?

829
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,788
I remember how I almost ended up
sitting there as a defendant, too.

830
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,875
You tried to indict me
as an accomplice to him--

831
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,879
You said you did not see
the sugar packet at the crime scene.

832
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,463
No.

833
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,257
But I was busy checking on my uncle--

834
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,301
-Answer yes or no--
-It's not necessary.

835
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,262
I'm the one
who told the witness before me.

836
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,266
But if you still want me to…

837
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:07,976
yes.

838
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:15,066
Your Honor, the witness was there
after Professor Kang Ju-man came by.

839
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,861
If he still did not see
the sugar packet there,

840
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,780
it lowers the reliability
of Professor Kang Ju-man's testimony

841
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,491
on how he brought sugar
to the crime scene.

842
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:27,203
I understand how you tried very hard
to destroy the credibility of the sugar.

843
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,705
Just because I didn't see it

844
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,957
-doesn't mean nobody else did.
-I rest my case.

845
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:31,875
Oddly enough,

846
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,503
you didn't request the one who saw
the sugar packet as your witness.

847
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,172
I was finished questioning him.

848
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,341
Please delete his final remark
from the record.

849
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,093
I'll say it during the cross-examination.
It's unnecessary.

850
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,303
JUDGE

851
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,305
You let the prosecutor toy you around,

852
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,390
but look at how he's playing with him.

853
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,309
Defense counsel, cross-examine.

854
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,937
Keep a good eye on him.
This is how you'll learn.

855
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,064
You won't even ask questions.

856
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,154
No broadcasting scheduled for today?

857
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,368
Not in the mood.

858
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,537
It's on the subrogation right.

859
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,168
Ms. Kang Sol?

860
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,006
Why didn't she call us a bit later?

861
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,390
What brings you here?

862
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:29,975
Let's go inside.

863
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,194
I'm finished.

864
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,114
Defense counsel, cross-examine.

865
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,366
Let me do it.

866
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,661
I'd be grateful.

867
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,455
Your Honor.

868
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,626
Yes, I just got here, Father.

869
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,839
I'll call you after the trial.

870
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,177
I'll begin questioning.

871
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,682
JUDGE

872
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:11,766
Witness.

873
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,936
You once came to me with this.

874
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,856
Your Honor, the evidence wasn't
a part of the main examination.

875
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,441
I request to question him

876
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,943
on an issue that wasn't a part
of the main examination.

877
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,822
Are we going to see something new
with every single witness?

878
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,742
Many aspects weren't disclosed
during the investigation.

879
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,909
What is he…

880
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,369
Permission granted.

881
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,125
Strictly speaking,

882
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,210
we're allowed to only cross-examine

883
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,713
on things mentioned
during the main examination.

884
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,007
Article 76.1,
Regulation on Criminal Procedure.

885
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,801
The judge just granted me permission
to question him

886
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,387
on something not mentioned
in the main examination.

887
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:55,060
Therefore, this will be considered
as a main examination,

888
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,604
which forbids me
from asking leading questions.

889
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,107
Defendant. This is not a lecture hall.

890
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,317
Yes, it's a courtroom.

891
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,279
Look at how he couldn't help
but give a lecture.

892
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,448
Listen up.

893
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,659
Then let me question you on the aspects

894
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,120
the prosecution overlooked.

895
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,874
Why did you come to me with this?

896
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,711
SUMMER BREAK, 2020

897
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,798
You want to make an accusation
against Prof. Seo Byung-ju?

898
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,175
Article 126, the Criminal Code.

899
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,677
I want to accuse him
for publicizing suspected crime.

900
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,430
Prof. Seo publicized
your dad's accusation as a prosecutor

901
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,682
then caused him to take his own life?

902
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,644
Yes. If you saw the files,
I'm sure you'd know--

903
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,605
Prosecutors are never indicted
for publicizing suspected crimes,

904
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,564
not even once.

905
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,982
Are you aware of that?

906
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,610
-Yes.
-And it'll never be easy.

907
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,279
I'm aware of that.
That's why I came to you--

908
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,280
Why me?

909
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,368
Tell me a reason why you need me
to get your revenge.

910
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,456
I needed your help for my revenge.

911
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,125
A revenge against who?

912
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,168
Professor Seo Byung-ju.

913
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,420
He killed my father.

914
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,339
-What?
-Really?

915
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,091
What on earth is this now?

916
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,177
-Seriously?
-He killed him?

917
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,012
-Did you know about this?
-No.

918
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,140
Order.

919
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,102
Witness, continue.

920
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,151
My father…

921
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,987
He was the CEO of a toy company.

922
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,448
I wonder if you remember TOYGOODTOY.

923
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,033
Mr. Seo, this is bad.

924
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,120
Then someone said
carcinogens were detected in his products.

925
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,206
Apologize to the children!

926
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,208
-Apologize!
-Stop using carcinogens!

927
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,044
News articles poured out,
and his name trended online.

928
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,880
Protests and demands of compensation…

929
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,839
FUN WORLD OF TOYS

930
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,799
But that's probably all you remember.

931
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,927
After the investigation,

932
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,222
none of his toys included
a toxic level of cancer-causing agents.

933
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,818
My father lost his reputation
and was framed unfairly.

934
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,990
He took his own life
after he lost everything.

935
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,877
-Objection.
-Of course you'd object.

936
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,796
The Korean law guarantees
the presumption of innocence.

937
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,509
So how was the witness's father framed
because of a false accusation?

938
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,928
Before the investigation was completed,

939
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,764
the media heard of his accusation
then reported on it.

940
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,736
After my father passed away,
I swore to avenge his death

941
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,614
on Prof. Seo Byung-ju,

942
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,616
who killed him
by leaking out his accusation.

943
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,579
Are you saying Seo Byung-ju is an enemy
who killed your father?

944
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,289
Your Honor, he's leading the witness.

945
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,999
What exactly am I trying to get to?

946
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,710
He's trying to point out
the witness's resentment

947
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,421
to prove the witness has
a stronger motive than him…

948
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,592
Come to think about it,

949
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,262
the witness does have
a much stronger motive

950
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,471
to murder the victim.

951
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,523
Did you tell any investigators
about your relationship with Seo Byung-ju?

952
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,275
I never had a chance to.

953
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,442
No one asked.

954
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,902
No one asked?

955
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,406
The basic step in murder investigation

956
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,366
is finding hateful relationships
of the victim.

957
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,995
I guess they were set
on having you as the culprit.

958
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,955
-Objection!
-And I agree.

959
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,000
Your Honor.

960
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,502
The witness is sharing an opinion

961
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,171
and a very personal opinion he has of me,
not facts.

962
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,259
Witness, only provide factual testimonies.

963
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,304
Do not share your personal opinions

964
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,056
such as how you could've been
sitting here in my place

965
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,641
if they asked you one question

966
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,644
before they began to design a whole story
on my motive of murder.

967
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,272
Come to my office
to tell me such personal opinions.

968
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,861
Then I have no choice but to ask.

969
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,614
Seo Byung-ju.

970
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,370
Did you kill him?

971
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,712
Is this real?

972
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,633
The son of TOYGOODTOY's CEO
is Yang's student? I got chills.

973
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:40,219
He thinks Seo Byung-ju disclosed
his dad's accusation.

974
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,098
So that's why his nephew came to see me.

975
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,518
I hope he didn't do this
to get revenge for his father.

976
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,646
If he did,
he totally killed the wrong man.

977
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,563
Be quiet.

978
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,151
Man, I can't believe this mess.

979
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:59,280
It didn't look like
Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.

980
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,324
So what if he feels guilty at this point?

981
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,743
But still, he leaked it out,
not Seo Byung-ju.

982
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,036
I told you to be quiet!

983
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,340
Then I have no choice but to ask.

984
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,051
Seo Byung-ju.

985
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:21,969
Did you kill him?

986
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,142
I didn't need to.

987
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,144
You didn't need to?

988
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,064
It was the day my father died,

989
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,775
so I went to tell him
I'll get my revenge by the law.

990
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,782
My nephew, you're here.

991
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,425
You aren't my nephew.

992
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,677
You're my son.

993
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,683
My son.

994
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,354
Do you know how much…

995
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,150
I love you?

996
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,486
I do.

997
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,121
Please don't forget that…

998
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,083
my son.

999
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,591
Seeing him high on drugs

1000
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,011
seemed worse than his death.

1001
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,309
You left him there
knowing that he was on drugs?

1002
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,769
Because he was on drugs.

1003
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,938
I couldn't call 911,

1004
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,609
so I called a friend of mine at school
who used to be a doctor.

1005
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,027
SEO JI-HO

1006
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,528
But he didn't pick up.

1007
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,238
Prosecution.

1008
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,826
The witness held a grudge on the victim
and witnessed him intoxicated.

1009
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,579
Don't you find
the record of statement on Seo Ji-ho

1010
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,289
to be a bit too insufficient?

1011
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,834
Yes, well…

1012
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,380
Since the defendant fed coffee with drug
to the victim,

1013
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,967
I thought it's natural for the witness
to see the victim intoxicated.

1014
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,344
It wasn't drugs, it's sugar!

1015
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,345
Defense counsel.

1016
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,765
I knew we needed to have Kang Sol B here.

1017
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,891
Defense counsel.

1018
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,854
You stated you were in your office
at the presumed time of his death,

1019
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,066
between 14:25 and 14:55, correct?

1020
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,068
Yes.

1021
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:47,156
2:25 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

1022
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,289
SEO JI-HO

1023
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,093
You're right.

1024
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,391
JUDGE

1025
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,608
I was in my office.

1026
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,398
You weren't there
at the time of the incident?

1027
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:06,652
Your Honor. I found an eyewitness
who saw the defendant kill Seo Byung-ju.

1028
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,447
People are beginning to doubt it,
and reasonably so.

1029
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,990
I never suspected Prof. Yang.

1030
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,492
It feels awful to see myself
beginning to suspect him.

1031
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,078
Who do you think the witness is?

1032
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:17,872
Hold on.

1033
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:21,125
Does it mean there's a possibility
that Prof. Yang actually killed him?

1034
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,045
Seung-jae, what happened to you that day?

1035
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,839
He said this new witness
saw you murder the victim.

1036
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,299
He's sitting in this court.

1037
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,675
It's game over.

1038
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,386
When you actually saw that,
you got out of control?

1039
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:37,224
