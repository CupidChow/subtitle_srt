[The Night is Still Young]

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,780
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,000
Your Highness,

4
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,190
you've been accompanying Her Highness

5
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,910
for several days without rest.

6
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,090
Why don't

7
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,550
you take a brief rest as well?

8
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,490
It's not time to rest yet.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,900
Do we have any leads?

10
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,140
Yes, we do.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,770
The Eagle Guard is already tracking and monitoring.

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,720
Before the matter is fully investigated,

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,340
don't let Her Highness know.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,060
I'm afraid she'll worry too much.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,539
I understand, Your Highness.

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,990
Where is His Highness?

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,310
Your Highness,

18
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,750
His Highness has been patrolling all night.

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,050
His current whereabouts are unknown.

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,960
[We found General Shangguan. Come quickly. Mingxuan]

21
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,840
Ye Mingxuan.

22
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,460
Weiyang.

23
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,480
Ye Mingxuan,

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
you said in your secret message that you found my father.

25
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,730
Where is he?

26
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,400
Follow me. You'll see for yourself.

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,100
General Shangguan!

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,760
Stop!

29
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,240
Father!

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,579
Father!

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,470
What on earth happened?

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,950
How did this happen?

33
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,070
Ye Beichen,

34
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,270
why did you attack General Shangguan?

35
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,050
Ye...

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,160
Father...

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,960
Ye...

38
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,400
Ye Beichen...

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,860
Father!

40
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,830
General Shangguan!

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,450
Father!

42
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,230
-Father!
-Ye Beichen!

43
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,620
It was indeed you.

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,020
To usurp the throne,

45
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,270
you took advantage of the General's camp inspection

46
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,320
and cruelly murdered him.

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,350
Your crime deserves death.

48
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,890
Nonsense.

49
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,010
What reason would I have to harm General Shangguan?

50
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,790
Reason?

51
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,240
It's obvious.

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,520
General Shangguan must have discovered your secret plot of rebellion,

53
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,810
and he refused to be your accomplice

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,780
or aid your evil deeds.

55
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,500
Out of resentment, you killed him to silence him.

56
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,000
You...

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,150
Ye Beichen.

58
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,340
It was actually you.

59
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,650
I trusted you so much in vain.

60
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,200
Why did you kill my father?

61
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,930
Weiyang.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,530
Your Highness.

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,100
♫Lend me a moment of joy, with dreams of fantasy♫

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,950
♫Lend me half the warmth, to heal a lifetime♫

65
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,920
♫Lifting a cold lamp, illuminating the city♫

66
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,970
♫Who waits in the fleeting years♫

67
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
♫Refusing to budge an inch♫

68
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,019
Ye Beichen,

69
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,240
let go of me!

70
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,660
♫Hate that we can't meet♫

71
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,880
Ye Beichen!

72
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,390
-Ye Beichen! Let go of me!
-Ye Beichen!

73
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,150
Let go of her!

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,190
-Let go of me!
-Ye Beichen!

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,160
Ye Beichen, put me down!

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,750
♫Lend me a setting sun, to fall on a lonely city♫

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,350
Let me go!

78
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,930
Weiyang, listen to me.

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,120
It's not like that, Weiyang.

80
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,750
♫Lend me the silent wind, to accompany me for a while♫

81
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,510
♫Frost on my heart, as cold as bone-eating ice♫

82
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,070
♫Chasing memories of years gone by♫

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,659
♫Geese pass, leaving only regrets and cries♫

♫Our love was a mutual mistake♫

85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,400
Ye Beichen,

86
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,940
I wish I could cut you into a thousand pieces right now!

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,580
♫I sigh half my life, unable to leave the fog♫

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,870
Weiyang,

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,870
calm down first.

90
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,760
Think carefully.

91
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,340
How could I possibly harm your father?

92
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,790
♫Lighting another stick of sandalwood♫

93
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,350
I saw it with my own eyes.

94
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,340
I saw my father pointing at you.

95
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,180
♫Burning the bitterness of parting♫

96
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,450
How could that be false?

97
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,110
♫Looking back, life is but a dream♫

98
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,890
There must be something strange about this matter.

99
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,670
I will definitely find out the truth for you.

100
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,050
♫Leaving only love and hate to return to the dust♫

101
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,160
The truth?

102
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,100
Do you think I would still believe these

103
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,450
fabricated lies of yours?

104
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,330
Weiyang,

105
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,910
I've done so much for you,

106
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,390
yet it can't outweigh a few words of provocation?

107
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,840
No matter what you say now,

108
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,270
I feel like you're just making excuses.

109
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,470
I only believe what I've seen with my own eyes.

110
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,040
♫Lend me a setting sun, to fall on a lonely city♫

111
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,350
So, I'll find out

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,960
the truth myself.

113
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,630
Weiyang, listen to me.

114
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,670
The mastermind dares to frame me,

115
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,150
♫Lend me the silent wind, to accompany me for a while♫

116
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,490
which means they're weaving a big net.

117
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,260
Staying by my side is the safest for you.

118
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,340
Ye Beichen, stop pretending to care.

119
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,920
♫Frost on my heart, as cold as bone-eating ice♫

120
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,950
If you have the guts, kill me now.

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,400
Otherwise, I will definitely uncover the truth

122
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,600
and kill you for revenge.

Your Highness,

134

Her Highness, she...

135
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,450
It's all my fault.

136
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,770
I was careless for a moment.

137
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,650
I thought I had everything under control,

138
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,400
yet I fell into Ye Mingxuan's trap

139
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,470
and caused her to witness her father's death.

140
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,320
I was at a loss for words at that time.

141
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,920
She lost her reason,

142
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,930
which is understandable.

143
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,890
Order the Eagle Guard

144
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,710
to guard her strictly.

145
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,300
Absolutely do not let her leave the palace.

146
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,960
Yes, Your Highness.

147
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,140
Father.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,300
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,670
I'm sorry, Father.

150
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,710
I thought that by living again,

151
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,170
I could change the outcome.

152
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,710
But I never expected

153
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,220
that I still couldn't save you.

154
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,270
And I even caused your death to happen earlier.

155
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,230
I lived again

156
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,120
just to save you.

157
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,100
But why hasn't anything changed?

158
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,950
Everything is already destined.

159
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,900
How could it be easily changed?

160
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,230
My good daughter,

161
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,460
don't be too hard on yourself.

162
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,100
Father knows

163
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,100
you've done your best.

164
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,169
Father has to go now.

165
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,740
Weiyang,

166
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,820
you need to learn to take care of yourself.

167
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,900
No.

168
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,750
No, Father.

169
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,400
Father.

170
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,110
Don't leave me alone.

171
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,940
Father.

172
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,720
Father!

173
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,040
No.

174
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,230
No.

175
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,650
No.

176
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,580
No.

177
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,870
Father!

178
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,450
Ye Beichen.

179
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,750
My lady.

180
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,030

Yue!

My lady.

184
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,740
His Highness ordered

185
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
that the Queen should rest well.

186
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,180
No one is allowed to disturb her.

187
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,980
Miss Yue, please leave.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,610
Yue!

189
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,950
