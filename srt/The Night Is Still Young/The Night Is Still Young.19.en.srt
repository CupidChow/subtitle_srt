00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,350
My lady!

00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,530
My lady!

5
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,230
What's the matter? Why are you in such a hurry?

6
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,830
Someone claiming to be a messenger from the Xuannan Army

7
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,310
delivered a confidential letter,

8
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,630
and requested that you open and read it personally.

9
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,330
You only need to exploit Ye Beichen's weakness

10
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,990
to lure him away.

[King Yan's Mansion]

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if he refuses to let go,

13
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,180
we can still buy time.

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,130
Your Highness.

15
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,259
Chu Mo, I need to go to the Town God's Temple.

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,330
You take the team and continue forward.

17
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,030
Yes.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,870
You come with me.

19
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,550
Yes.

20
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,350
And I will lead another team

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,420
to intercept the prisoner on the official road.

22
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,450
Your Highness,

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,300
you truly are prescient.

24
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,000
As long as we frame the Xuannan Army's mutiny

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,539
and Feng Xuanyi's death

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,990
as a mutual destruction with the Eagle Guards,

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,470
both sides will fight to the death.

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,100
When the Xuannan Army revolts,

29
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,220
and court disputes arise again,

30
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,520
that will be my true moment of power.

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,630
Your Highness is wise.

32
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,400
How dare you

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,250
kidnap my Queen?

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,360
You're asking for death!

35
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,480
Your Highness,

36
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,540
I'm not afraid to die.

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,850
The Queen Yan will be buried with us anyway.

38
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,800
Come on!

39
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,510
Used by thieves, utterly foolish.

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,730
If you were my subordinate,

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,030
I would have already cut off your head

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,840
and hung it outside the tent.

43
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,230
Take a good look.

44
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,780
This is His Highness's handwriting.

45
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,370
Ye Mingxuan has just become the Crown Prince

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,510
and urgently needs military power.

47
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,040
But Jun Yang is leading troops outside

48
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,110
and is cut off from information.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,210
He only knows that I'm cooperating with Ye Mingxuan

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,080
but doesn't know I've been harmed by him.

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,290
I'm worried Ye Mingxuan will deceive them.

52
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,130
If the Xuannan Army is used by him,

53
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,640
it will surely lead to endless troubles.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,720
You can give this blood letter to Jun Yang

55
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,350
to eliminate future troubles.

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,940
[The one who harmed me is Ye Mingxuan.]

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,630
Ye Mingxuan actually betrayed His Highness

58
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,390
and played us for fools!

59
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,390
You've been used as pawns.

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,890
The time you bought is enough

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,350
for Ye Mingxuan to step on your brothers' bodies

62
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,790
and assassinate Feng Xuanyi.

63
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,380
Let's go!

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,100
Hurry.

65
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,580
I guessed Ye Mingxuan wouldn't let me leave easily

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,090
and would kill me.

67
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,130
But I didn't expect

68
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,860
you to protect me.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,040
If you die,

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,570
the Xuannan Army will rebel,

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,959
and the court will be in turmoil.

72
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,430
Tonight, you'll leave with the Eagle Guards through the small path.

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,370
Your Highness, it's Ye Mingxuan's death squad.

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,280
It's indeed him.

75
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,500
What a Crown Prince.

76
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,540
I will always remember your great

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
kindness to the Xuannan Army.

80
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,250
Now that we've cut off Ye Mingxuan's connection with the Xuannan Army.

81
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,850
It's like cutting off one of his arms.

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,450

He's at the end of his rope.

85
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,570
But we must also prevent him from desperate counterattacks.

86
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,790
When our great revenge is achieved,

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,950
I suppose we

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,050
and everything around us

89
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,980
will gradually get better, right?

90
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:43,990
Of course.

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,300

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,280
Garrisoning troops requires money.

171
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,010

he has lost the supply from the Xuannan Army.

175
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,800
He can only borrow from the imperial armory,

176
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,780
using inferior goods as substitutes.

177
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,740

I will not let him escape.

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,990
Order the Eagle Guards to lie in wait on the official road.

185
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,930
I will lead the troops to surround and eliminate them.

186
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,610
As you command.

187
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,500
Weiyang.

188
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,780
I have urgent military matters to attend to.

189
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,710
It's a pity...

190
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,220
It's alright.

191
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,470
Duty comes first.

192
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,930
These paintings can be drawn anytime.

193
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,930
Wait for me to return.

194
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
Your Highness, they're here.

195
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,800
Don't move! Surrender your weapons and you won't be killed!

196
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,770
Your Highness,

197
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,210
the people and military equipment

198
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,250
are all here.

199
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,800
Something's not right.

200
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,880
So many military equipments

201
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,810
can't be escorted by just a few people.

202
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
Ye Beichen?

203
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,560

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,220

My lady!

238
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,130
Something terrible has happened!

239
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,350
News has come from the Eagle Guards

240
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,810
that His Highness has fallen into an ambush.

241
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,870
What exactly happened?

242
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,910
Your Highness,

243
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,460
last night, His Highness discovered

244
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,070
the Crown Prince's secret troop garrison.

245
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,700
He led the Eagle Guards

246
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,480
to intercept their military equipment transportation,

247
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,090
but they fell into a trap.

248
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,390
Whether they will survive is uncertain.

249
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,300
Where did this happen?

250
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,890
Take me there quickly.

251
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,350
Yes.

252
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,780
Search.

253
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,210
Keep searching.

254
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,150
As long as there's no body,

255
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,650
it's a good sign.

256
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,060
We can't give up even the slightest hope.

257
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,170
Yes, Your Highness.

258
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:28,870
Let's go!

259
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,640
-Yes!
-Yes!

260
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,510
This is...

261
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,960
My lady.

262
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,140
Could His Highness have been captured?

263
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,339
They disappeared because of Ye Mingxuan's

264
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,310
secret troop garrison.

265
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,680
There must be

266
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,630
a register of provisions

267
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,950
and a list of soldiers.

268
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Such important things,

269
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,770
he must have hidden them himself.

270
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,020
Mingxuan.

271
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,390
[Past Life]

272
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:24,890
Mingxuan.

273
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,589
Mingxuan.

274
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,280
Weiyang.

275
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,850
Weiyang.

276
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,060
As long as we find the ledger,

277
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,610
even if Ye Beichen has truly been captured by Ye Mingxuan,

278
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,470
we'll have leverage.

279
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:26,990
[Ledger]

280
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,810
Weiyang?
