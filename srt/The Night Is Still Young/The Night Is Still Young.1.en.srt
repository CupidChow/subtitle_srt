Report!

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,070
King Yan has rebelled!

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,230
Report!

6
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,350
King Yan has rebelled!

7
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,900
My lady,

8
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,180
King Yan has massacred the entire Shangguan family.

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,310
Now, to seize the Shangguan family's military power,

10
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,690
he's coming to take you away, as well!

11
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,670
He's already broken into the inner city!

12
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,820
Today is the wedding of the Fifth Prince and Miss Shangguan.

13
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,670
We must defend the city gates with our lives against King Yan!

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,989
Charge!

15
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,230
Ye Beichen,

16
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,570
you cruelly murdered my father

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,820
and massacred my entire Shangguan family.

18
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,750
Even if I die the cruelest death today,

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,880
I will make you pay blood for blood.

forcibly take your nephew's wife,

30
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,900
and disregard human ethics.

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,640
Hand over Shangguan Weiyang,

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,300
and I might leave your body intact.

33
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,710
King Yan is committing treason.

34
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,140
His crime deserves death.

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,200
Show no mercy!

36
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,010
Ye Beichen,

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,820
even if you die ten thousand times,

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,950
it won't be enough to pay for the lives of my Shangguan family.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,800
Ye Beichen,

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,150
how dare you poison me!

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,050

Once you find Ye Beichen,

kill him on the spot!

45
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,460
Yes, sir!

46
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,630
Don't worry. They've already left.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,360
Your Majesty, please issue a decree

48
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,270
to bestow Shangguan Weiyang in marriage to me.

49
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,710
Your Majesty, I am unwilling.

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,440
Thank you for your kindness, King Yan,

51
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,560
but I already have someone I love.

52
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,800
General Shangguan plotted to murder the Emperor.

53
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,990
The evidence is conclusive.

54
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,470
Throw him into the imperial prison!

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,940
Clearly, you framed my father

56
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,329
to seize the Shangguan family's military power.

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,830
the deep blood feud between us

59
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,390
is irreconcilable.

60
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,920
Even if I fall into the endless depths of hell,

61
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,770
I will curse you for all eternity

62
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,540

why am I here?

76
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,710
Didn't you make an appointment with the Fifth Prince

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,150
to meet at the Lantern Tower?

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,650
Mingxuan…

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,830
What year is it now?

80
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,800
Today is the fifteenth day of the first month in the year of Jiayou,

81
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,670
the Lantern Festival.

82
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,870
The Lantern Festival in the year of Jiayou?

83
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,020
How did I return to three months ago?

84
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,490
How is this possible?

85
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,930
Could it be...

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,830
Could it be that I've been reborn?

87
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,510
My lady.

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,400
It's three months until my wedding

89

with Mingxuan.

90
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,950
Nothing has happened to the Shangguan family yet.

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,570
My father is still alive.

92
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,180

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,580

Yue,

95
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,520
wait here for Mingxuan for me.

96
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,180
Just tell him

97
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,760
I have an urgent matter and need to go back to see my father.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,200
My lady.

99
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,470
It's him.

100
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
That's right.

101
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,430
I once saved his life during the Lantern Festival.

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,480
After that, we had little interaction.

103
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,360
But he repaid kindness with betrayal,

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,130
plotting against the Shangguan family behind our backs.

105
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,220
I only regret not being able to grind his bones to dust.

106
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,330
Now that I have a second chance,

107
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,100
I swear to change everything.

108
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,740
I will cut off the root of this fate,

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,440
protect my family,

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,950
and never make the same mistakes again.

111
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,540
Over there.

112
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,390
Tomorrow night is the Emperor's family banquet.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,110
There can be no mistakes.

115
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,710
Yes.

116
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,070
-Remember.
-Father!

117
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,790
Here…

118
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,400
Father!

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,020
Father.

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,680
Weiyang?

121
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,050
Father!

122
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,860
I'm so glad you're alright.

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,159
Look at you.

124
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,330
You're engaged now.

125
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,180
Why are you still acting like a child?

126
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,140
What…

127
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,230
Why are you crying?

128
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,960
Did the Fifth Prince bully you?

129
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,930
I just had a nightmare.

130
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,010
I dreamed that we'd never see each other again.

131
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,130
Silly girl.

132
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,620
Am I not right here, safe and sound?

133
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,170
The position of Crown Prince has long been vacant.

134
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,270
Shangguan, what do you think of the Fifth Prince?

135
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,910
I do not align myself with any faction.

136
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,440
Please be cautious with your words, Lord Li.

137
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,350
Forgive my frankness,

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,020
but you and King Yan each hold a military tally.

139
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,480
He intimidates foreign states

140
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,840
while you command respect in the court.

141
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,620
Even if you wish to remain neutral and uninvolved,

142
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,030
it will be difficult.

143
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,330
Mingxuan.

144
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,720
Mingxuan.

145
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,460
I missed our appointment last night because…

146
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:44,970
It's alright.

147
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,560
You never need to explain yourself to me.

148
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,030
Oh, right.

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,220
I've specially kept something nice for you

150
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,450
in the ice cellar.

151
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,810
Wait here, I'll go get it.

152
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,390
Then, let's meet at our usual place later.

153
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,800
Mingxuan!

154
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,510
There's something I…

155
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,550
What?

156
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,670
Surprised to see me?

157
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,110
I didn't mean to disturb Your Highness.

158
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,960
I shall take my leave now.

159
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,300
You're quite good at avoiding me.

160
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,820
This is my first time meeting Your Highness.

161
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,900
How could I be avoiding you?

162
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,270
First time?

163
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,200
Then, who do I have to thank for the wounds on my body?

164
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,950
I don't understand what you're talking about.

165
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,200
Then, let me help you remember.

166
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,900
Your Highness, please restrain yourself.

167
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,970
I am already engaged to Mingxuan.

168
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,390
I am to be your future niece-in-law.

169
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,950
So what if you're my nephew's wife?

170
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,200
Harassing your nephew's wife in broad daylight,

171
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,230
aren't you afraid of being ridiculed by everyone?

172
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,060
I couldn't care less.

173
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,430
What exactly do you want?

174
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,780
You dare to attempt to assassinate me.

175
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,330
How should I punish you?

176
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,740
The one who tried to assassinate you that day was clearly an assassin.

177
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,720
It has nothing to do with me.

178
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,960
Oh, really?

179
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,330
So, you've stopped pretending, huh?

180
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,430
You...

181
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,440
Fifth Prince.

182
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,980
Get out of my way.

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,860
Fifth Prince.

184
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,490
Get out of my way!

185
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,070
You can't go there.

186
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,410
-Weiyang!
-Let go of me.

187
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,510
Weiyang!

188
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,050
Let go!

189
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,150
Move aside!

190
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,950
Let go!

191
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,550
Weiyang!

192
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,640
Let go of me!

193
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,440
Weiyang!

194
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Weiyang.

195
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,540
Let go.

196
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,470
Let go.

197
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,270
Weiyang.

198
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,410
Uncle?

199
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,800
Why has the Fifth Prince forgotten his manners?

200
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,930
Uncle, why are you with Weiyang?

201
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,160
So what?

202
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,220
Uncle, you've just returned from the northern frontier.

203
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,590
You don't know yet

204
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,690
that I already have someone I love.

205
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,650
She is General Shangguan's only daughter,

206
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,130
Shangguan Weiyang.

207
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,510
Weiyang,

208
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,950
you should address him as Uncle, too.

209
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,770
Uncle.

210
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,280
Mingxuan.

211
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,690
I disturbed Uncle by accident.

212
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,470
Let's go.

213
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,200
Alright.

214
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,150
Try this.

215
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,320
Is it good?

216
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
It's a rare delicacy from the foreign tribute.

217
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,750
I knew you'd love it.

218
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,050
Mingxuan.

219
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,370
I heard there will be fireworks at today's family banquet.

220
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,600
Could you have them removed?

221
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,550
Why?

222
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,170
The fireworks are dazzling and colorful.

223
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,420
Don't you like them?

224
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,950
Save the Emperor!

225
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,080
[Past Life]

226
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,890
The previous fireworks incident

227
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,610
gave Ye Beichen an opportunity to claim credit.

228
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,250
What reward do you desire?

229
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,690
[Emperor]

230
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,290
I request Your Majesty to issue a decree

231
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,770
to bestow Shangguan Weiyang in marriage to me.

232
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,400
I've heard

233
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,970
that a few days ago, fireworks caused a fire in the suburbs,

234
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,430
resulting in casualties among some vagrants.

235
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,560
We should be more cautious about the family banquet in the palace.

236
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,840
Such dangerous items

237
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,230
really shouldn't be present.

238
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,780
Weiyang.

239
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,350
The items used in the palace are certainly safe.

240
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,400
You don't need to worry.

241
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,650
Mingxuan,

242
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,090
have you forgotten New Year's Eve

243
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,660
when I was almost injured by firecrackers?

244
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,660
Now, whenever I hear fireworks,

245
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,830
I have nightmares.

246
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,580
Could you order the fireworks display to be removed,

247
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,610
please?

248
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,810
Alright.

249
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,990
Alright.

250
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,050
[Humble as Bamboo]

251
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,640
Thanks to King Yan for guarding the border.

252
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,110
Foreign countries fear and respect his prestige.

253
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,590
Every January,

254
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,370
they present these numerous rare treasures,

255
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,620
allowing us the fortune to admire this glass vase.

256
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,210
-Yeah.
-Yes.

257
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,540
It's nothing but borrowed power.

258
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,120
Foreign countries submit to His Majesty's dragon might.

259
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,310
Father,

260
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,380
[Third Prince]

261
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,560
this scene inspires me to compose a poem.

262
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,440
It goes:

263
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,470
♫The winds rise, and the geese return in rain-soaked furs♫

264
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,460
The Emperor's longevity brings blessings to all.

265
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,050
♫In the capital, carriages and horses are slow♫

266
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,250
Dragon's power protects the nation for a thousand autumns.

267
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,720
♫I can't undo my love for several lifetimes♫

268
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,480
His Majesty's light shines upon the world.

269
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,670
The Emperor's virtue is praised in all directions.

270
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,940
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

271
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,720
♫Entangled in love and hate, love is hanging by a thread♫

272
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,400
The fireworks have been canceled.

273
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,240
♫I hate to not look at your eyes♫

274
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,690
♫I ask under the moon, in front of the city tower♫

275
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,190
Your third brother and sixth brother

276
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,320
are over there composing poems

277
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,430
to please the Emperor.

278
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,920
♫She's in red♫

279
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,590
Shouldn't you hurry over?

280
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,680
♫We meet with fierce glares and end all grudges with one word♫

281
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,440
Let them compete among themselves.

282
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,440
♫The sharp sword in the heart says farewell to the empire♫

283
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,130
I just want to

284
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,850
stay here with you.

285
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,790
♫We've parted in this life; let's meet again in the next life♫

286
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,360
Come, let's go enjoy the moon.

287
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,160
The fireworks this year are really impressive.

288
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,180
You're behind this, aren't you?

289
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,760
Watch out!

290
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,980
Protect the Emperor!

291
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,700
Protect the Emperor!

292
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,100
Your Majesty, this way!

293
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,920
Protect the Emperor!

294
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,730
Let's see how you can stir up trouble now.

295
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,950
Father, be careful!

296
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,330
Mingxuan!

297
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,660
Your Majesty,

298
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,220
the Fifth Prince's back was burned by sparks.

299
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,000
I have applied a cooling and healing salve.

300
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,760
He only needs to rest for a few days to fully recover.

301
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,070
You may leave now.

302
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,730
Father.

304
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,130
Mingxuan,

305
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,580
you have done well in protecting me.

306
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,340
I shall reward you generously.

307
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,590
Tell me, what do you want?

308
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,700
Father,

309
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,420
Weiyang and I are in love.

310
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,050
Father, please choose an auspicious date

311
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,990
for our wedding.

312
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,950
Since you two are in love,

313
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,070
your marriage

314
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,480
should indeed be put on the agenda.

315
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,350
I will allow you to marry in three months…

316
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,160
Your Majesty!

317
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,329
Your Majesty,

318
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,349
the fireworks incident was not an accident.

319
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,020
Someone deliberately planned it.

320
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,130
I just inspected the fireworks launching device.

321
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,920
Someone indeed tampered with it.

322
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,390
We need to investigate this matter thoroughly right away.

323
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,240
What?

324
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,140
Someone dares to attempt to harm me?

325
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,010
Mingxuan,

326
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,220
go and investigate this thoroughly.

327
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,980
Yes, Father.

328
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,590
Father.

329
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,530
My dear daughter,

330
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,210
the weather is so nice today.

331
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,400
Why haven't you gone out to enjoy it?

332
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,230
Father, I just wanted to spend more time with you.

333
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,010
Oh, you.

334
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,540
Master. My lady.

335
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,780
A decree has arrived from the palace.

336
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,360
By the grace of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

337
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,270
Shangguan Weiyang, daughter of General Zhenyuan,

338
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,920
virtuous, graceful, kind, and honest,

339
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,790
[Imperial edict]

340
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,250
is hereby betrothed to King Yan, Ye Beichen.
