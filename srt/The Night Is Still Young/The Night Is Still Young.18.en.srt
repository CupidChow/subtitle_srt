[Episode 18]

3
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,560
Come on, make way.

4
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,870
Move aside. Move aside.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,880
Let us through.

6
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,870
Now that my plans have been exposed,

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,970
I'm afraid I can't stay in Ye City any longer.

8
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,250
But before I leave,

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,910
I must see Weiyang one last time.

10
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,010
Kid?

11
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,380
Okay.

12
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,050
[Beauty House]

13
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,009
Weiyang?

14
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,910
I knew you would come.

15
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,300
Weiyang.

16
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:52,910
I know

17
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,830
it may be a bit late to say this now,

18
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,759
but I still want to say goodbye properly

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,030
to you before I leave.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,040
Actually,

21
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,840
I've liked you for a long time.

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,050
From the moment we first met,

23
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,390
your radiant presence made you stand out among thousands,

24
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,180
and I was immediately drawn to you.

25
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,390
And now, after our many interactions,

26
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,000
my admiration for you has only grown deeper.

27
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,320
It's just a pity...

28
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,570
pity that I misjudged people,

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,350
falling into his trap.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,190
But don't worry.

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,540
When I return to Xuannan,

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,950
I will surely rise again.

33
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,400
What a touching confession.

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,790
How come it's you?

35
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,980
Feng Xuanyi,

36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,620
not only are you poor at judging people,

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,760
but your eyesight isn't very good either.

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,390
You...

39
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,300
But I didn't expect

40
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,210
you to like Weiyang too.

41
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,000
Looks like you and I

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,360
do have something in common after all.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,630
On my turf,

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,760
where do you think you can run to?

45
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,590
Ye Mingxuan, don't get so smug.

46
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,210
Your vicious ambition

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,810
will be exposed to the world sooner or later.

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,290
Save your breath.

49
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,329
Arrest him

50
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,030
and let him rise again... from prison.

51
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,840
Weiyang.

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,200
Uncle,

53
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,270
could it be that you're also here

54
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,900
to arrest the wanted criminal Feng Xuanyi?

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,420
I am here.

56
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,310
No one can take him away.

57
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,280
Uncle, could it be that you want to rebel together with Feng Xuanyi?

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,810
[Order]

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,740
[Order]

60
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,250
Father,

61
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,850
I previously put myself at risk

62
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,670
by pretending to ally with Feng Xuanyi.

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,640
Only then did I find

64
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,529
evidence of Feng Xuanyi's intention to rebel.

65
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,510
The fireworks explosion at the previous palace banquet

66
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,600
and the deaths of Vice General Wang and General Shangguan

67
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,450
were all orchestrated by him behind the scenes.

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,690
Father, please judge wisely.

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,010
It was all done by him?

70
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,710
Yes,

71
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,740
he did all of it.

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,440
If I remember correctly,

73
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,490
Fifth Prince,

74
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,480
you previously wanted to put Feng Xuanyi to death.

75
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,750
Uncle, you've misunderstood.

76
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,430
I didn't want to kill Feng Xuanyi.

77
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,720
I only wanted to capture him.

78
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,770
What about moving the counterfeit money?

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,810
That was to obtain evidence of his rebellion.

80
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,670
What about General Shangguan's death?

81
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,659
Poor General Shangguan.

82
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,680
It was because he discovered Feng Xuanyi's vicious ambition

83
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,630
that he was killed by him.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,050
What a silver tongue.

85
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,500
But according to my investigation,

86
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,560
your alliance with Feng Xuanyi was not fake—

87
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,720
it was a real partnership.

88
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,450
This is the secret correspondence of their conspiracy.

89
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,600
It even has the Fifth Prince's personal seal on it.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,150
This is the secret letter exchanged between the Fifth Prince and me.

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,250
Your Majesty,

92
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,500
the reason the Fifth Prince threw Feng Xuanyi under the bus

93
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,350
was to sacrifice a pawn to protect himself.

94
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,790
Please investigate thoroughly, Your Majesty.

95
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,610
Do you have anything else to say?

96
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,020
[Given time, you and I will surely achieve great things together] [Mingxuan of Great Ye]

97
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,350
What else do you have to say?

98
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,350
Father, please let me explain.

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,610
These are all fake.

100
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,310
The reason I put myself at risk

101
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,470
and pretended to cooperate with him

102
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,020
was that I had already seen through his plan.

103
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,890
This is the treasonous alliance agreement

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,150
that I obtained from King Xuannan.

105
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,160
It has not only King Xuannan's signature

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,730
but also the handwritten signatures of other kings from different lineages.

107
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,220
This proves

108
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,090
they have long harbored treasonous intentions,

109
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,310
aiming to break free from the court's control

110
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,430
and carve out their own kingdoms.

111
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,410
These traitors all deserve to die!

112
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,159
Father, please calm your anger.

113
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,860
This matter

114
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,060
must not be decided hastily.

115
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,080
What?

116
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,690
What good strategy do you have?

117
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,190
I believe

118
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,720
that kings from different lineages have always been 
a hidden danger throughout history,

119
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,200
but they can only be gradually weakened,

120
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,750
not forcibly removed.

121
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,240
Otherwise, it will surely lead to widespread rebellion,

122
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,470
plunging the people into chaos.

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,280
Instead, Father, you could issue an edict

124
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,200
under the pretext of study tours,

125
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,210
ordering these kings to send their eldest sons to the capital

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,409
as hostages.

127
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,650
This move will surely make them hesitate to rebel,

128
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,690
fearing for their sons' safety.

129
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,040
Your Majesty.

130
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,670
Come on.

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,659
My brother has been so mighty and commanding for many years,

132
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,700
stabilizing the borders

133
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,870
and achieving great military achievements.

134
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,460
There is already nothing left to bestow upon him.

135
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,990
If I'm still alive,

136
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,400
I can still keep him in check.

137
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,310
But if I were to pass away,

138
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,409
I really can't think of

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,470
any of my sons

140
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,550
who could stand up to him.

141
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,600
Your Majesty,

142
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,200
please don't say that.

143
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,120
You are in the prime of your life.

144
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,610
You have been serving me for all these years.

145
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,770
There's no need for empty flattery.

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,190
I know my own health condition.

147
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,810
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,780
What I'm worried about

149
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,190
is all about King Yan.

150
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,720
But I didn't expect

151
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,310
Mingxuan...

152
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,010
to rise so unexpectedly.

153
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,560
Do you think the Fifth Prince is

154
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,830
not as simple as he seems

155
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,490
but rather ruthless

156
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,820
and would stop at nothing?

157
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,470
I don't know,

158
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,320
and I don't even dare to speculate.

159
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,799
When the older brother dies and the younger brother inherits,

160
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,470
this often brings calamity.

161
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,480
A weak ruler and a strong minister

162
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,660
can also lead to power slipping away.

163
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,530
For an emperor,

164
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,040
it's better to have sons who are wolves rather than sheep.

165
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,610
And morality is something that binds the saint,

166
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,790
not emperors.

167
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,460
Your Majesty, you're wise.

168
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,550
I have learned much from you.

169
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Since Mingxuan has the ability

170
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,790
to challenge King Yan,

171
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,830
I will give him this opportunity.

172
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,240
I'd like to see

173
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,190
if this son of mine, who resembles me the most,

174
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,460
can truly protect my empire.

175
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,310
Go and draft the decree.

176
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,720
Queen.

178
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,510
How did it go?

179
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,670
Ye Mingxuan discovered that Feng Xuanyi

180
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,450
intended to collude with other kings 
from different lineages to rebel.

181
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,630
The Emperor was furious

182
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,740
and issued an order to revoke Feng Xuanyi's hereditary fief,

183
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,720
and he would soon be exiled.

184
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,400
At the same time, the Emperor particularly commended Ye Mingxuan
for his meritorious service in protecting the country

185
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,250
and decided to crown him as the Crown Prince.

186
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,910
What?

187
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,890
[Imperial Edict]

188
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,940
By the grace of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

189
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,810
The Fifth Prince, Ye Mingxuan, is gentle, diligent,

190
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,240
humble, and intelligent.

191
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,200
He benefits the court and has rendered great service to the country.

192
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,800
He shall be immediately appointed as the Crown Prince,

193
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,160
to receive the heavenly mandate and succeed to the throne.

194
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,990
This decree is hereby issued to inform the world.

195
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,590
Thus, it is commanded.

196
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,800
Uncle,

197
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,940
I never thought there would be a day...

198
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,440
when I would wear these dragon-patterned robes.

199
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,880
Save your complacency for

200
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,350
when you truly sit on the throne.

201
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,360
Uncle, your character is strong and unyielding,

202
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,180
but you're always pressing others too hard.

203
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,020
Aren't you afraid that being too aggressive 
might make you an easy target?

204
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,240
Nephew, your methods are devious and scheming.

205
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,420
You might inevitably fall victim to your own schemes

206
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,780
and lose everything.

207
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,260
Uncle, you worry too much.

208
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,140
If one doesn't seize what heaven offers, they'll be blamed.

209
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,880
If one doesn't take action at the right moment, 
they'll suffer the consequences.

210
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,500
Born into the royal family, not fighting for benefits

211
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,990
is the path to destruction.

212
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,720
Look at me now.

213
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,450
Aren't I about to ascend the throne?

214
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,670
Until the very end, nothing is certain.

215
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,820
The future is still unknown.

216
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,390
You have only 10 minutes.

217
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,300
Weiyang.

218
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,520
Weiyang, why are you here?

219
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,640
How are you?

220
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,410
They didn't torture you, did they?

221
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,580
They wouldn't dare, even if they had the courage.

222
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,110
I knew that you cared about me.

223
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,770
When you wanted to see me yesterday,

224
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,350
did you have something important to tell me?

225
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,060
I have something important...

226
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,110
I...

227
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,590
I seem to have forgotten.

228
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,540
It's not on me.

229
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,610
Wait until I get out.

230
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,700
I'll give it to you when I'm out.

231
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,630
Is it a clue? Where did you put it?

232
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,330
No,

233
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,780
it's just...

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,210
something unimportant.

235
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,030
I thought

236
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,910
you would escape from Great Ye.

237
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,810
It's all my fault

238
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,060
for misjudging him.

239
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,900
I know

240
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
this wasn't entirely your fault.

241
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,840
You were also deceived.

242
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,710
So,

243
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
if you have any evidence to prove your innocence,

244
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,740
you must give it to me.

245
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,300
I'll do what I can to reduce your punishment.

246
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,490
If I had any,

247
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,910
I wouldn't be facing exile.

248
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,990
Don't worry. It's alright.

249
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,490
Once I leave Ye City,

250
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,030
I'll be like a dragon entering the ocean.

251
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,880
I'll definitely make a comeback.

252
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,770
If Ye Beichen dares to bully you,

253
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,090
I'll rescue you,

254
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,300
even if I have to tear down his mansion.

255
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,220
Think again.

256
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,840
Are there any important clues

257
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,800
that you may have overlooked?

258
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,540
Weiyang.

259
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,520
Why did you come here so suddenly

260
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,890
without notifying me in advance?

261
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,230
Weiyang.

262
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,070
Ye Mingxuan!

263
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,270
Let her go, Ye Mingxuan!

264
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,180
Let go of me.

265
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,300
If you dare harm her,

266
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,030
you'll pay for it when I get out!

267
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,470
Let go of me.

268
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,250
Ye Mingxuan!

269
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,870
Let go of me.

270
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,690
Let go of me.

271
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,780
Your Highness.

272
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,320
Get lost!

273
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,280
Weiyang.

274
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,730
What exactly are you looking for?

275
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,990
Feng Xuanyi raised his own army, killed important officials,

276
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,850
and planned to rebel.

277
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,430
Everyone can see it clearly.

278
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,070
Why do you choose to turn a blind eye?

279
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,430
The court can be deceived,

280
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,310
and the people can be fooled,

281
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,990
but my eyes won't be mistaken.

282
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,330
Weiyang.

283
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,580
I know you've been misled by Ye Beichen,

284
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,810
which is why you misunderstand me.

285
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,960
But now, I've become the Crown Prince.

286
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,880
As long as you return to my side,

287
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,570
I'll definitely make you see the truth.

288
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,190
You don't need to say anymore, Ye Mingxuan.

289
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,850
No matter how persuasive you are,

290
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,890
I will never trust your words again.

291
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,090
You won't trust my words,

292
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,620
yet you trust Ye Beichen's?

293
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,630
At least he's more upright and honest than you.

294
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,580
So, you're going to abandon me...

295
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,710
and marry him?

296
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,200
But I forgot to tell you, Weiyang.

297
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,940
I've already petitioned Father Emperor on your behalf.

298
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,160
The Crown Prince has just been appointed, 
and the entire nation shares in the joy.

299
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,930
It might be a conflict if the kings are getting married at this time.

300
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,800
Your wedding has been postponed.

301
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,920
So what?

302
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,290
Even if it were postponed for ten years,

303
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,470
I would still marry him.

304
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,320
I won't let anyone take you away from me.

305
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,830
What are you doing, Ye Mingxuan?

306
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you crazy?

307
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,940
Let go of me.

308
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,940
I am the Crown Prince.

309
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,550
So what if you're the Crown Prince?

310
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,920
If you dare to disrespect my fiancée again,

311
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,520
I'll make you understand what despair truly means.

312
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,780
Ye Beichen!

313
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,990
Sooner or later, I'll tear you to pieces

314
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,250
and scatter your ashes to the wind!

315
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,820
I never thought that this Ye Mingxuan,

316
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,410
after becoming the Crown Prince, would become even more despicable

317
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,570
and more unscrupulous.

318
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,010
That's his true nature.

319
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,570
What a pity.

320
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,230
I didn't manage to get any clues from him.

321
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,150
It doesn't matter.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,990
Even if he makes Feng Xuanyi take the fall,

323
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,360
his true nature won't change.

324
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,030
Sooner or later, he'll sink his claws

325
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,350
into the imperial court.

326
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,330
We just need to wait and see.

327
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,300
As for you,

328
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,650
next time, before acting impulsively,

329
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,000
could you discuss it with me first?

330
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,700
If Chu Mo hadn't reported in time...

331
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,280
I was wrong this time.

332
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,190
But you've got my back, don't you?

333
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,570
Aren't you supposed to escort Feng Xuanyi 
out of the capital tomorrow?

334
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,080
How do you have time to see me?

335
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,660
I've noticed you've been agitated and restless lately,

336
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
with rising internal heat,

337
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,780
so I specifically brought an ice pack

338
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,410
to relieve your toothache.

339
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,510
Ye Mingxuan has now turned the tables and become the Crown Prince.

340
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,470
Wanting to arrest him and bring him to justice

341
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,740
seems even more distant now

342
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,830
and increasingly difficult.

343
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,970
Just thinking about it

344
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,230
keeps me awake with anger night after night.

345
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,160
Don't rush things.

346
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,120
I'm here.

347
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:37,980
Come on.

348
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,860
Feeling better?

349
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,050
Ye Beichen is personally escorting His Highness out of the city,

350
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,820
with Eagle Guards keeping strict watch along the way.

351
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,060
Tell me,

352
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,850
how are we going to rescue His Highness?

353
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,420
That's not difficult.

354
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,490
Your Highness?

355
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,500
Your Highness, do you have a way

356
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,620
to rescue our King?

357
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,640
I am close friends with King Xuannan.

358
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,770
How could I possibly stand by and do nothing?

359
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

360
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,490
King Yan is powerful

361
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,060
and has framed King Xuannan in dire straits.

362
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
Although I am the Crown Prince,

363
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,550
I have no troops at my command.

364
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,480
It's truly difficult for me to contend with him.

365
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,530
Be assured, Your Highness.

366
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,190
As long as you can rescue our King,

367
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,180
we, the Xuannan Army, will remember your kindness

368
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,360
and will surely repay your favor

369
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,350
by following your leadership, Your Highness.

370
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,830
