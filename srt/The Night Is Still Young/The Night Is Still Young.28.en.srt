00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,900
[The Night is Still Young]

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,060
[Episode 28]

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,650
Miss Shangguan.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,230
Why are all of you here?

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,320
Please rise quickly.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,880
Miss, there's no need to help me up.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,560
If you do not agree to my request today,

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,000
I would rather kneel here until I die.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,600
Miss Shangguan,

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,160
the unrest and instability of people's hearts

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,300
are neither a blessing for the nation

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,960
nor for its citizens.

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,330
I implore you to leave the palace as soon as possible.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,080
I implore you to leave the palace as soon as possible.

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,490
So, it turns out that when the court officials cannot persuade the Emperor,

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,770
they resort to threatening a woman.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,320
I've truly seen something new today.

18
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,860
If you have the guts,

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,470
go talk to the Emperor.

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,270
What merit is there in bullying a woman?

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,820
Let's go.

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,570
Wait, this...

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,450
Feng Xuanyi, let go of me!

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,670
Weiyang,

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,430
stop staying by his side without any status or recognition.

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,600
Why are you here?

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,700
Do you know that

28
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,260
during my exile,

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,870
I endured the pain of the bone-chilling cold

30
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,050
and the hardship of endless labor.

31
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,140
The only thought that kept me alive

32
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,260
was the hope of returning

33
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,350
and seeing you again.

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,750
You still haven't told me

35
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,120
why you're here.

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,210
With Ye Beichen ascending the throne and granting amnesty to the world,

37
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,410
I have also ended my exile

38
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,460
and returned to Yunnan.

39
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,950
All the court officials came to pay their respects.

40
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,420
Can I not come to congratulate the new Emperor's coronation?

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,870
You dare address the Emperor by his name?

42
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,990
Feng Xuanyi,

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,730
You'd better watch your words.

44
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,840
You wouldn't want to be exiled back to the cold, harsh land, would you?

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,590
I do like this side of you.

46
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,770
Since you put it that way,

47
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
I'll reluctantly admit that

48
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,880
Ye Beichen's ascendancy to the throne

49
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,180
is indeed what the people of Great Ye want.

50
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,300
That would be best.

51
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,490
Feng Xuanyi,

52
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,960
I heard that you were only pardoned for your exile,

53
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,850
but the Emperor just restored your title as King Xuannan,

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,080
the territory has been reclaimed by the court.

55
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,300
You're nothing more than a prince in name

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,080
now.

57
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,759
Better focus on keeping yourself in check.

58
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,670
The Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi presents a pair of dragon-patterned vases

59
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,640
to celebrate the new Emperor's ascension.

60
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,460
King Xuannan presents a Yunnan queen bee.

61
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,789
Feng Xuanyi.

62
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,110
I am here.

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,590
What is the reason for offering this tribute?

64
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,720
Your Majesty,

65
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,579
the Feng family has long guarded Yunnan

66
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,880
on behalf of the throne as loyal servants to the imperial family.

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,670
Rare treasures like the queen bee

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,340
must naturally be offered to Your Majesty

69
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,620
as a token of unity between ruler and subject in Great Ye.

70
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,910
What fine unity between ruler and subject.

71
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,630
You deserve a reward.

72
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,540
What do you want?

73
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,190
Your Majesty, I humbly request

74
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,130
your grace to restore the Yunnan fiefdom to the Feng family

75
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,410
so we may continue to guard Yunnan in service

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,329
to you and the court.

77
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,380
The Feng family has guarded Yunnan for generations,

78
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,460
indeed contributing greatly to Great Ye.

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,680
But the court upholds clear rewards and punishments;

80
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,790
there can be no exceptions.

81
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,920
For now, Yunnan shall remain under the Feng family's stewardship.

82
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,610
If no errors occur within ten years,

83
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,450
I will formally grant Yunnan back to your family.

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

85
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,860
However,I have one more bold request

86
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,550
and humbly seek your approval.

87
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,300
Speak.

88
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,420
I have reached the age of thirty

89
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,900
yet remain unmarried.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,860
I humbly request Your Majesty to bestow Miss Shangguan to me

91
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,750
in marriage, granting unparalleled honor to the Feng family.

92
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,460
Feng Xuanyi!

93
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,370
I'm willing to marry in the Miss Shangguan's place.

94
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,800
I beg for Your Majesty's approval.

95
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,870
Very well.

96
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,440
King Xuannan's tribute of the queen bee is a meritorious deed.

97
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,160
Since a royal marriage is to be granted,

98
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,570
only a bride of noble rank is fitting.

99
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,780
The maid Yue,

100
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,240
raised in General Shangguan's mansion since childhood,

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,120
possesses both grace and refinement, with manners befitting her upbringing.

102
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,930
From this day forth,

103
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,740
she shall be elevated to the title of Hele Princess

104
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,340
and bestowed upon King Feng Xuanyi of Xuannan, as his wife.

105
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

106
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,250
Thank you, Your Majesty.

107
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,620
This is infuriating!

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,790
Trying to fool me!

109
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,850
How dare they try to fool me with a mere maid!

110
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,780
Your Highness,

111
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,560
should we just kill her?

112
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,230
Did we come to Ye City to kill people?

113
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,530
Behave yourself!

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,720
Your Highness,

115
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,950
the Emperor surely made it sound grand,

116
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,710
but this so-called ten-year agreement

117
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,980
is merely a way to turn the Feng family

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,530
into the court's workhorses.

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,430
Since the ten-year agreement is settled,

120
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,140
at least there's a conclusion to this matter.

121
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,130
Your Highness,

122
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,450
your father's instructions weren't merely about the fief.

123
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,100
Shut up!

124
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,350
Do you know where you are?

125
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,760
How dare you speak so recklessly?

126
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,660
Weiyang.

127
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,230
Feng Xuanyi.

128
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,200
Why are you still here?

129
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,470
Naturally, it's to see you.

130
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,540
This is the unique herbal flower crown from Yunnan.

131
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,680
Wearing it can ward off evil and avoid misfortune.

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,310
And this is the unique flower cake from Yunnan,

133
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,480
filled with fresh flowers and baked to order.

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,040
I made this especially for you before I entered the palace.

135
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,600
I kept it close to my chest earlier,

136
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,620
afraid it would get cold.

137
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,140
Feng Xuanyi,

138
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,360
what exactly are you trying to do?

139
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,030
Weiyang,

140
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,920
have you ever thought that

141
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,750
you can do so many things

142
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:50,790
that can't be done in Great Ye,

143
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,180
in the vast and open Yunnan,

144
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,380
like riding horses and shooting arrows together,

145
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,570
traveling freely wherever we want,

146
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,990
living as we please.

147
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,450
Until one day,

148
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,730
you'll notice my good qualities

149
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,930
and fall for me.

150
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,990
I'm sorry,

151
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,190
but my heart has no room for anyone else.

152
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,270
I don't care who's in your heart,

153
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,030
it won't stop me from liking you

154
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,720
and protecting you.

155
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,690
Feng Xuanyi,

156
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,190
are you forcing me to appoint a new King Xuannan?

157
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,270
Do you really think such a trivial offering

158
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,900
can win Weiyang's favor?

159
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,370
You're far too naive.

160
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,290
Moreover, without my summons,

161
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,110
no external official is allowed to linger in the palace for long.

162
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,290
You're showing a lack of decorum.

163
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,930
I just had a few words with Miss Shangguan.

164
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,870
I will certainly leave before the palace gates are locked.

165
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,840
Miss Shangguan?

166
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,420
Weiyang has long been my woman.

167
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,320
Some people may own the four seas and enjoy the world,

168
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,300
but the women by their side are still unhappy, aren't they?

169
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,340
This is a matter between Weiyang and me.

170
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,130
It's not your place to interfere.

171
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,710
Your Majesty, to be honest,

172
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,930
we have a custom in Yunnan.

173
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,700
As long as a young lady hasn't been married,

174
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,770
men can compete with each other

175
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,380
to win her favor.

176
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,390
Feng Xuanyi,

177
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,910
the customs of commoners

178
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,260
might not be suitable for the Emperor.

179
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,260
It's fine.

180
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,780
I will compete with him today

181
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,440
and make him admit defeat wholeheartedly.

182
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,400
On the field, there are no distinctions of rank.

183
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,480
If there is any offense,

184
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,180
I ask for your forgiveness in advance for my disrespect.

185
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,540
You'd better have the ability to offend me.

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,040
We found that not only the granary,

365
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,720
but also other storage warehouses carry the same scent.

366
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,660
They've been hiding their actions.

367
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,690
Transporting such a large amount of saltpeter

368
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,880
can only be for one thing-

369
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,190
to blow up Ye City.

370
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,340
To bring that batch of saltpeter into Ye City,

371
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,480
I spent countless efforts,

372
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,660
even keeping it from my prince.

373
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,660
I thought no one would notice,

374
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,089
but unexpectedly, you replaced it all with fireworks,

375
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,530
and I remained completely unaware.

376
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,470
Assassins! Be careful!

377
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,369
Protect His Highness!

378
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,030
Watch out!

379
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,750
Hurry up!

380
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,720
Protect His Majesty!

381
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,850
After them!

382
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,690
Be careful!

383
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,390
Feng Xuanyi!

384
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,610
Weiyang.

385
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,300
Are you alright?

386
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,570
I'm fine.

387
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,970
But you...

388
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,090
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,250
I promised to accompany you to Yunnan for happy days.

390
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,900
I may not be able to do it anymore.

391
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,500
Whether you believe it or not,

392
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,160
I... I want to tell you

393
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,890
that my feelings for you

394
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,650
are real.

395
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,690
♫Lend me a moment of joy, with dreams of fantasy♫

396
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,210
I wanted to give this to you

397
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,740
the last time we met.

398
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,080
I... I grew up in Yunnan.

399
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,700
♫Lend me half the warmth, to heal a lifetime♫

400
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,710
It's rare to see snow.

401
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,720
♫Lifting a cold lamp, illuminating the city♫

402
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,430
After meeting you,

403
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,780
I finally realized

404
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,310
that the Weiyang flower is so beautiful.

405
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,600
♫Who waits in the fleeting years♫

406
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,140
♫Refusing to budge an inch♫

407
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,320
♫Hate that we can't meet♫

408
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,440
♫Lend me a setting sun, to fall on a lonely city♫

409
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,610
Feng Xuanyi.

410
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,340
Ye Beichen.

411
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,750
You say...

412
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,420
♫Lend me the silent wind, to accompany me for a while♫

413
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,810
I... It seems that this time I'll truly be buried by you.

414
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,250
♫Frost on my heart, as cold as bone-eating ice♫

415
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,590
Can you send me back to Yunnan?

416
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,580
Don't worry,

417
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,670
♫Chasing memories of years gone by♫

418
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,260
I'll send the Eagle Guards to take you home.

419
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,390
♫Geese pass, leaving only regrets and cries♫

420
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,150
And about our ten-year promise;

421
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,750
I will definitely keep it.

422
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,600
♫Our love was a mutual mistake♫

423
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:17,120
♫I sigh half my life, unable to leave the fog♫

424
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,770
Weiyang,

425
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,850
if there's a next life,

426
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,730
I...

427
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,020
I'll make sure to meet you

428
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,420
♫Lighting another stick of sandalwood♫

429
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,770
♫Burning the bitterness of parting♫

430
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,090
before Ye Beichen does.

431
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,640
♫Looking back, life is but a dream♫

432
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,760
♫Leaving only love and hate to return to the dust♫

433
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,540
Feng Xuanyi!

434
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,530
Feng Xuanyi!

435
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,210
Feng Xuanyi!

436
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,990
Feng Xuanyi!

437
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,790
Feng Xuanyi!

438
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,610
Ye Mingxuan.

439
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,820
♫Lend me a setting sun, to fall on a lonely city♫

440
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,650
♫By the silent wind♫
