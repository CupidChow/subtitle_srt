182
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,340
♫Memories linger, refusing to fade quietly♫

183
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,030
♫Time flies, and the love, hate, joy, sorrow♫

184
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,910
♫Partings and reunions come alive on the page♫

185
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,210
♫A wish from the past life, fulfilled in this life♫

186
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,790
♫The world is eternal♫

187
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,930
Once upon a time,

188
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,830
there was a little girl.

189
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,810
She dreamed that one day,

190
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,980
she could wear the bridal gown with the pattern of Weiyang flower

191
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,130
and marry the one she loved.

192
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,300
They could grow old together and accompany each other.

193
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,580
But before the girl could marry,

194
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,370
her father was killed by bad people.

195
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,840
From then on,

196
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,930
the father and the daughter were separated forever.

197
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,930
So, she often thought,

198
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,130
if death is inevitable

199
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,030
and we must eventually leave,

200
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,270
no matter how reluctant we are,

201
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,700
we can't escape the ending fate has given us.

202
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,980
Then, can we, while we're alive,

203
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,100
cherish every second,

204
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,270
do what we want to do,

205
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,530
love who we want to love?

206
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,700
Only then can we live without regrets

207
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,520
and not waste this life.

208
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,660
Once upon a time,

209
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,050
there was a boy.

210
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,610
He was surrounded by endless darkness,

211
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,420
walking on the edge of danger every day.

212
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,510
Until one day,

213
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,150
he met a girl.

214
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,860
That girl was like a beam of light,

215
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,960
illuminating all his darkness.

216
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,870
From then on,

217
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,460
because of this girl,

218
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,330
the boy's life gained meaning.

219
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,570
Whenever the girl was sad,

220
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,800
the boy would always appear by her side.

221
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,430
The beginning of their story

222
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,870
wasn't perfect.

223
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,760
The journey was even more tortuous,

224
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,150
accompanied by misunderstandings,

225
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,420
suspicions,

226
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,380
grudges,

227
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,080
and entanglements.

228
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,780
All the way to life-and-death protection.

229
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
No matter what the future holds,

230
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
or how it ends,

231
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,710
at least at this moment,

232
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,090
can the two of us let go of all their worries

233
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,130
and only see each other?

234
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,370
Let's go.

235
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,200
Look, they're striking iron fireworks!

236
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,150
Take a look at the blessing tablets.

237
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,340
They're for safety and peace.

that instead of being cautious,

282
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,839
it's better to live in the present.

These gifts

297
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,350
were sent by His Highness early this morning.

298
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,740
I heard from Chu Mo that

299
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,410
His Highness ordered the palace embroiderers to work through the night

300
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,930
to embroider these golden Weiyang flowers

301
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,040
one by one.

302
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
I can't believe he remembered

303
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,950
even a casual remark I made.

304
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,870
[Auspiciousness Gathering]

305
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,540
Weiyang,

306
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,950
you are truly beautiful.

307
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,060
Your Highness!

308
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,160
Your Highness!

309
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,160
Your Highness!

310
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,280
Something terrible has happened, Your Highness!

311
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,530
Ye Mingxuan has been released without charge!

312
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,150
How could this happen?

313
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,530
I've received a message

314
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,980
that the evidence we obtained earlier

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,370
was all fabricated by Feng Xuanyi.

316
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,060
It was used to frame Ye Mingxuan.

317
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,730
Feng Xuanyi is the real culprit behind all this.

318
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,730
The palace has issued an order

319
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,930
to arrest Feng Xuanyi throughout the city.

320
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
What should we do now?

321
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,990
We must find Feng Xuanyi

322
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,190
before Ye Mingxuan does.
