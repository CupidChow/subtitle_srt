Never mind.

159
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,320
There must be evidence of his collusion with Ye Mingxuan.

160
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,190
Let me talk to him.

I knew you would save me.

163
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,320
Just like last time when I was in danger,

164
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,030
you did the same thing,

165
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,820

Feng Xuanyi,

167

but how have you repaid me?

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,550
You secretly colluded with Ye Mingxuan

170
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,470
and killed my father.

171
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,750
Heaven and Earth be my witness.

172
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,390
Weiyang,

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,130
Even if I die,

175
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,350
I would never harm you.

176
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,880
I just want to know the whole truth.

177
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,730
If you want to know the answer,

178
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,800
you must answer me three questions.

179
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,360
Go ahead.

180
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,140
First question,

You've been building up to this for so long,

just to ask this?

184
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,080
This is very important to me.

185
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,500
I practice archery daily.

186
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,470
Occasionally, I brew tea and make incense.

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,390
Second question,

188
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,430
Weiyang,

189
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,710
what kind of person do you like?

190
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,930
I'll only know when I meet them.

191
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,620
Well, Feng Xuanyi,

192
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,700
what are you really trying to do?

193
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,770
I just want to ask if I have a chance

194
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,870
to win your love.

195
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,510
No.

196
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,680
I understand.

197
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,170
Actually, many emotions in this world

198
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
are unrequited.

199
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,800
But I believe that

200
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
with my personal charm,

201
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,520
one day,

202
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,530
you will be mine.

203
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,810
Now it's time for you to fulfill your promise.

204
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,680
Actually, you guessed right.

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,170
Ye Mingxuan did want to build a great cause with me.

206
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,370
He promised me

207
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,820
that if I helped him seize the throne,

208
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,120
he would grant me a kingdom of my own.

209
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,280
That day,

210
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,000
General Shangguan discovered the secret of the mine.

211
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,990
Xuanyi, you're here.

212
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,880
Come and see how this batch of goods is.

213
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,850
Can it be circulated?

214
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,760
General Shangguan tried to persuade him to turn back,

215
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,040
but

216
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,550
he was blinded by power and profit.

217
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,020
It was really Ye Mingxuan

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,290
who killed my father.

219
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,070
He asked me to destroy the evidence,

220
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,360
and then ruthlessly killed General Shangguan,

221
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,360
and framed Ye Beichen for it.

222
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,090
Weiyang.

223
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,980
Weiyang.

224
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,000
After being reborn once,

225
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,730
not only did I fail to change the fate of the Shangguan family,

226
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,900
but I actually accelerated my father's death.

227
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,690
It's all my fault.

228
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,920
I misjudged Ye Mingxuan.

229
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,700
I failed to uncover his true face earlier.

230
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,830
I failed to protect my father.

231
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,360
Weiyang.

232
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,880
You're awake.

233
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,990
You've been with me all along?

234
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,790
I want to show you something.

235
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,100
What is this?

236
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,570
This is the Gu that was swapped by Huan Yan.

237
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,270
Ye Mingxuan used it to control my father

238
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,790
and then framed you.

239
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,970
Ye Mingxuan has finally shown his true colors.

240
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,870
But soon,

241
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,870
I will make him tell the truth

242
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,670
and avenge your father.

243
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,800
Fifth Prince, please remain calm.

244
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,250
There are fallen rocks blocking the road ahead.

245
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,410
Let me clear the path.

246
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,790
Where are you?

247
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,680
Is anyone there?

248
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,020
Ye Mingxuan.

249
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,070
General Shangguan?

250
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,830
Ye Mingxuan.

251
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,340
A life for a life.

252
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,020
It was Ye Beichen who killed you.

253
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,240
If you want revenge, you should go to him!

254
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,200
Ye Mingxuan.

255
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,170
How dare you deceive me?

256
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,650
The one who killed me is you,

257
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,090
not Ye Beichen.

258
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,150
You're already dead.

259
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,470
Does it matter

260
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,060
who killed you?

261
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,390
You counterfeited cpins, embezzled weapons,

262
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,520
and colluded with feudal lords to rebel.

263
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,870
Every one of your doings deserves death.

264
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,050
How dare you still argue?

265
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,390
So what if it was me?

266
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,620
If you hadn't insisted on reporting to Father,

267
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,330
I wouldn't have thought of killing you!

268
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,710
Only by blowing up your body,

269
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,890
would the Gu worm not be exposed.

270
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,320
Blame yourself for being too loyal

271
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,490
and failing to see the situation clearly!

272
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,960
Huan Yan.

273
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,200
It's time for your Ghost Gu to show its power.

274
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,810
Don't let me down.

275
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,540
Repeat after me,

276
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,670
Ye Beichen is the one who killed me.

277
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,000
Ye Beichen has no grudge against you.

278
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,390
Why would you frame him

279
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,070
for your evil deeds?

280
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,600
Ye Beichen,

281
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,370
he dared to compete with me for the throne

282
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,700
and took away my Weiyang.

283
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,830
He deserves to die!

284
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,190
You approached Weiyang

285
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,980
for the military power of the Shangguan family.

286
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,940
Nonsense!

287
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,300
My feelings for Weiyang...

288
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,180
My feelings for Weiyang...

289
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,460
Ye Beichen?

290
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,390
Watch out!

291
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,910
Weiyang!
