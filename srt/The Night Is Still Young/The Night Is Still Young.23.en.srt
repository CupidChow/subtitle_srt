[The Night is Still Young]

2
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,880
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,740
I have recently caught a cold.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,810
I shouldn't eat too much sweet food.

5
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,290
How about

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,870
you eat it first?

7
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,270
Don't waste it.

8
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,700
My lady,

9
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,289
you plan to poison the Crown Prince with osmanthus cake?

10
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,260
These are just ordinary osmanthus cake ingredients.

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,140
If I want to take Ye Mingxuan's life,

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,680
I mustn't be too hasty.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,080
I must first gain his trust.

14
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,730
Weiyang, I was wrong.

15
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,490
What's wrong?

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,880
Did you burn your hand?

17
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,440
It's fine.

18
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,400
Mingxuan,

19
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,390
I never thought

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,410
that one day

21
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,080
we would become like this.

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,180
Weiyang,

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,810
please don't misunderstand.

24
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,729
I don't blame you.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,210
All that have happened

26
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,789
might be fate's doing.

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,550
We are destined to be a fleeting love.

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,070
Weiyang, Weiyang!

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,460
Weiyang.

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,290
Weiyang.

31
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,260
I ate the osmanthus cake.

32
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,020
It's exactly like the one my mother used to make.

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,930
You must have put a lot of effort into it.

34
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,660
And I made you sad.

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,620
It's all my fault.

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
It's just some osmanthus cakes.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,150
Crown Prince, please don't say such things.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,800
Weiyang,

39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,290
there are many misunderstandings between us.

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,950
But whether you believe it or not,

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,110
my true feelings for you

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,300
have never changed.

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,070
Since now I'm the Crown Prince,

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,530
I shall make you the Crown Princess

45
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,100
to show my sincerity.

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,210
No.

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,990
I was once betrothed to another.

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,870
I can't bear the title of Crown Princess.

49
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,590
I think you can.

50
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,920
You can definitely do it.

51
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,720
I have made up my mind

52
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,920
to make you the Crown Princess.

53
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,050
Mingxuan.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,590
Weiyang.

55
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,130
You are truly beautiful.

56
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,800
Mingxuan,

57
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,730
this is osmanthus wine I brewed myself.

58
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,940
Why don't you try it first?

59
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,310
Sounds good.

60
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,070
I never thought

61
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,420
I would have the chance to marry you as your consort in this life.

62
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,780
I'll drink this one first.

63
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,190
This is a toast to you.

64
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,030
May your prestige grow day by day,

65
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,730
and may we grow old together.

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,390
Weiyang,

67
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,610
I have waited for this day

68
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,080
for far too long.

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,420
I promise you,

70
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,750
I will soon choose an auspicious date to make you my consort,

71
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,660
and welcome you into the Eastern Palace.

72
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,250
The two of us

73
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,150
being able to come this far

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,870
is something I never expected either.

75
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,880
I'll do as you say.

76
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,080
Weiyang,

77
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:39,909
I remember you never wear armor,

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,620
finding it troublesome, right?

79
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,930
Your Highness,

80
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,590
the Sorcerer King has arrived.

81
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,440
Mingxuan, what's going on?

82
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,440
The Sorcerer King has come from afar.

83
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,170
I should personally go to welcome him.

84
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,890
Sorcerer King,

85
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,170
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,760
Father has been gravely ill for many days.

87
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,310
I can't do anything about it.

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,200
Please help with your powers.

89
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,440
I observed the stars all night,

90
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,350
seeing the Lagerstroemia Star covered by clouds,

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,950
and the Left and Right Assistant stars shining brightly.

92
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,060
Thus, I knew that His Majesty's health's failing

93
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,070
and state affairs have fallen on the Crown Prince's shoulders.

94
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,590
When you sent me a message,

95
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,150
I was already on my way.

96
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,250
Sorcerer King, you're truly a divine being.

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,560
Please lead the way.

98
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,290
Let me first examine His Majesty's condition.

99
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,270
Please.

100
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,000
Who exactly is this Sorcerer King?

101
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,570
After Father fell into a coma,

102
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,050
the court officials and princes

103
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,720
have been suspicious of me.

104
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,670
They invited many famous doctors to treat Father,

105
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,230
but most of them were unsuccessful.

106
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,750
Sorcerer King, you are a legendary doctor.

107
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,320
If even you cannot cure Father,

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,400
it will silence the gossip throughout the realm.

109
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,670
His Majesty needs to rest quietly.

110
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,790
I have issued an edict.

111
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,390
Without my written order,

112
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,130
no one is allowed to enter the palace.

113
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,680
Don't bother looking for them.

114
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,030
I've hidden them well.

115
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,970
If anyone dares to intrude here,

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,650
they will surely die without a trace.

117
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,520
Your Highness is indeed meticulous.

118
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,330
However, Sorcerer King,

119
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,970
I wonder about Father...

120
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,470
No need for further words.

121
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,670
Whether His Majesty is ill or poisoned,

122
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,920
you know better than I do.

123
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,040
You could guess my thoughts

124
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,970
from thousands of miles away.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Then I shall not conceal it anymore.

126
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,990
I wonder if you have a way to make Father

127
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,299
pass away unsuspectedly

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
under the name of treatment,

129
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,909
so that I can ascend the throne according to ancestral customs.

130
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,270
If I help you,

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
it would be against the entire world.

132
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,220
When I was once trapped in Miao territory,

133
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,670
I was fortunate to receive extraordinary skills from you.

134
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,430
I promise you

135
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,470
that as long as I ascend to the throne,

136
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,050
I will appoint you as the Imperial Advisor of Great Ye,

137
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,580
making Sorcery Cult the supreme religion in the world.

138
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,460
This is the world's finest mechanism.

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
The trigger point changes each time.

140
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Whoever dares to approach the imperial bed,

141
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,940
intending to rescue His Majesty,

142
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,470
will surely trigger the mechanism

143
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,130
and be killed by a hail of arrows.

144
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,620
But rest assured,

145
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,670
I've just deactivated the mechanism.

146
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,870
It's safe now.

147
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
His Majesty is already on his last breath.

148
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
I will set up an array in the palace.

149
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,690
Within seven days,

150
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,120
His Majesty will return to heaven.

151
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,560
By then, people will only think that His Majesty's time has come.

152
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,970
They won't detect even the slightest flaw.

153
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,430
I've heard that this Sorcerer King is proficient in medicine, divination, and astrology.

154
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,920
I've also heard

155
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,030
that his medical skills are extraordinary,

156
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,860
bringing the dead back to life and healing the most severe wounds.

157
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,980
He was specially invited by the Crown Prince to treat His Majesty.

158
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,920
It's not about treatment at all.

159
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,570
Ye Mingxuan deliberately invited Ji Wuming here.

160
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,380
It's actually a conspiracy to harm His Majesty.

161
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,670
My lady, what should we do?

162
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,030
This is just my speculation for now.

163
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,740
We must not act rashly.

164
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,770
Wait until I have more information.

165
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,600
What are you planning to do?

166
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,980
I should be the one asking you that.

167
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,990
I've heard that the Crown Prince wants to make General Shangguan's only daughter

168
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,360
his Crown Princess.

169
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,550
Since you can move freely in the Eastern Palace,

170
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,950
you must be Miss Shangguan.

171
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,240
The Seven-Star Lamp is an evil object used to extend life.

172
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,830
When the lamp goes out, the person dies.

173
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,870
You're here to harm His Majesty.

174
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,420
You know quite a lot, young lady.

175
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,440
But my sorcery has a unique style

176
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,190
and hard for others to understand.

177
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,450
I don't care what your style is.

178
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,270
Attempting to harm His Majesty

179
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,100
is a capital offense that will lead to your whole family's execution.

180
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,950
I'm afraid you will be disappointed.

181
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,970
I'm the only one left in the Ji family.

182
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,300
I'll kill you right now!

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,490
Young lady, you have a fiery temper

184
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,850
and need to cultivate your mind and control yourself.

185
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,020
Let me fix your

186
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,740
problem of being deliberately mystifying.

187
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,670
Weiyang,

188
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,430
why are you here?

189
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,820
What happened?

190
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
I just returned to my room

191
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,390
and found Miss Shangguan here uninvited.

192
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,890
She also spilled my cinnabar.

193
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,740
I'd like an explanation from Miss Shangguan.

194
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Mingxuan,

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,180
I heard the Sorcerer King can read fortunes.

196
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,650
I wanted him

197
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,290
to help me predict my marriage prospects.

198
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,560
As for spilling the cinnabar,

199
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,510
it was purely accidental.

200
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,610
Weiyang,

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,530
does our marriage prospects trouble you so much

202
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
that you need to come to

203
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,150
to the Sorcerer King's room late at night to ask about it?

204
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
Mingxuan,

205
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,430
after all, my status is different from before.

206
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,160
I often wonder

207
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,900
if I'm truly worthy of the title of Crown Princess.

208
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,490
Sorcerer King,

209
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,740
please select an auspicious date as soon as possible

210
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,670
so that I can formally marry Weiyang.

211
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,520
The sooner, the better.

212
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,580
But this cinnabar

213
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,420
has been ruined by Miss Shangguan.

214
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,770
How am I supposed to proceed?

215
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,740
That's not a problem.

216
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,700
I'll order the Imperial Affairs Department to send more.

217
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,810
This cinnabar is a spiritual item I refined.

218
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,020
It's extremely rare.

219
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,480
I request that Miss Shangguan personally clean it

220
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,950
before I choose an auspicious date.

221
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,540
May I ask, Sorcerer King,

222
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,320
how should this cinnabar be cleaned?

223
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,990
You need to use pure stream water

224
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,160
to rinse the cinnabar 91 times,

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,540
and then use a soft, clean white silk cloth

226
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,990
to wipe it until it's spotless.

227
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,540
Only then can it be considered acceptable.

228
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,970
Has the cinnabar been cleaned according to my requirements?

229
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,820
Would you like to try one personally?

230
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,560
If that's the case,

231
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,080
I will now select an auspicious date

232
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,460
for you to marry the Crown Prince as soon as possible.

233
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,280
Please wait outside for good news.

234
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,260
[Reaching the Heavens]

235
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,790
This Sorcerer King always gives me

236
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,350
a sense of familiarity.

237
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,550
Weiyang,

238
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:10,680
don't worry.

239
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,450
After the Sorcerer King finishes divining,

240
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,380
we can get married soon.

241
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,640
What is he really up to?

242
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,550
Crown Prince,

243
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,690
the Lagerstroemia Star is powerless.

244
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,870
The Left Assistant Star is starting to exert its power.

245
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,620
Do not let the Greedy Wolf Star take advantage

246
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,170
and ruin the favorable situation.

247
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,750
What do you mean by that?

248
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,340
Do you feel any discord in your marriage prospects?

249
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,530
Like the moon reflected in water,

250
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,190
seemingly close at hand,

251
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,310
yet never truly attained.

252
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,570
Sorcerer King, why do you say that?

253
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,700
The Crown Prince is destined by heaven.

254
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,470
The timing and the advantage of the land

255
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
both follow the Crown Prince's life.

256
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,500
Only the marriage part is afflicted with malefic forces.

257
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,220
If you marry someone with a gold destiny,

258
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,150
there will be bloodshed.

259
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,620
Shangguan Weiyang has a pure yang and gold destiny.

260
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,590
What a sharp weapon that kills in all directions.

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,880
Nonsense!

262
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,110
How could I possibly hinder Mingxuan's affairs?

263
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,830
Yeah.

264
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,630
Weiyang is my future Crown Princess,

265
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,840
sharing the same mind and virtue with me.

266
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,330
Since ancient times, the mandate of heaven cannot be defied,

267
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,710
and the mysteries cannot be unraveled.

268
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,970
If you want to fulfill the mandate of heaven,

269
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,210
Shangguan Weiyang must be killed!
