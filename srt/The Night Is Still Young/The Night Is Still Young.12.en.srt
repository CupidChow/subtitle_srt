♫Time slowly tells the stories of the past♫

187

what is love?

188
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,100
Love is something

189
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,710
uncontrollable

190
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,530
and unforgettable.

191
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,050
Even if the end result is like a moth to the flame,

192
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,810
risking everything to be burned,

193
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,560
you would still, countless times,

194
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,160
willingly repeat the same mistakes

195
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,130
for that person.

201
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,910

202
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,180
♫Of being forgotten by each other?♫

203
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,790
and finds no place to rest.

204
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,740
I never thought that

205
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,880
♫Holding a solitary lamp♫

206
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,530
you seemed cold and heartless,

207

♫To part ways with that old acquaintance♫

208
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,540

♫This life is lonely, the road stretches endlessly♫

210
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,850

My lady!

230
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,250
Oh no!

231
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,000
Master has gone missing in the outskirts of the city.

232
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,140
What?

233
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,500
A well-respected commander of the imperial guards,

234
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,940
who had attendants protecting him even while going out,

235
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,470
disappeared during a routine patrol.

236
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,050
How

237
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,710
has the capital become so dangerous?

238
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,970
Father, please calm down.

239
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,270
Please take care of your body.

240
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,580
This matter is indeed suspicious.

241
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,770
I'm afraid someone might take advantage of it

242
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,090
for their own gain.

243
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,520
I also believe there is more to this matter.

244
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,870
But once we find General Shangguan,

245
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,830
everything will come to light.

246
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,990
Find him.

247
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,550
Find him at all costs!

248
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,140
I accept the command.

249
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,490
Your Majesty.

250
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,700
Make way!

251
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,070
The Shangguan's army is divided into four paths,

252
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,370
with every hundred steps searched;

253
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,750
not a single detail should be missed.

254
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,390
Sir.

255
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,160
They're just clothes.

256
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,070
Sir.

257
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,350
These are just medicinal herbs.

258
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,050
Thank you, sir.

259
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,630
Let's go.

260
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,130
Sir.

261
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,240
Thank you, sir.

262
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,550
-Father!
-General Shangguan!

263
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,020
Father!

264
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,360
Weiyang, take a rest.

265
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,190
No.

266
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,650
Every moment I delay in finding him,

267
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,930
he becomes more at risk.

268
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,990
This is the road he must take during his patrol;

269
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,290
I must have overlooked something.

270
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,240
Father!

271
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,630
But you've already been searching tirelessly

272
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,610
for days without rest.

273
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,280
Father!

274
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,050
Don't worry.

275
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,510
The Eagle Guard has already sealed off the entire territory;

276
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,520
no clue will be left unchecked.

277
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,120
Weiyang.

278
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,500
Father.

279
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,350
Take a rest.

280
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,550
My father

281
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,820
will be alright, won't he?

282
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,170
General Shangguan has fought on the battlefield for decades,

283
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,090
emerging unscathed

284
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,950
from countless battles.

285
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,060
A man of great fortune like him

286
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,260
♫Lend me a moment of joy, with dreams of fantasy♫

287
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,890
will surely be safe.

288
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,450
My father has never

289
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,190
♫Lend me half the warmth, to heal a lifetime♫

290
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,740
broken a promise to me,

291
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,770
so this time, he will definitely come back.

292
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,170
♫Lifting a cold lamp, illuminating the city♫

293
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,570
I really didn't expect

294
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,080
the renowned General Shangguan

295
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,170
♫Who waits in the fleeting years♫

296
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,870
to be so gentle and kind.

297
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,710
♫Refusing to budge an inch♫

298
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,950
♫Hate that we can't meet♫

299
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,410
Since I was young, my father has always cared for me.

300
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,640
I didn't like studying,

301
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,010
♫Lend me a setting sun, to fall on a lonely city♫

302
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,940
so he taught me martial arts instead.

303
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,960
My mother passed away early,

304
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,870
and I was afraid of being alone,

305
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,900
♫Lend me the silent wind, to accompany me for a while♫

306
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,820
so my father kept me by his side.

307
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,640
It's also because of this

308
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,900
that for so many years,

309
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,670
♫Frost on my heart, as cold as bone-eating ice♫

310
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,310
he has remained single.

311
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,110
I'm different from you.

312
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,140
♫Chasing memories of years gone by♫

313
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,910
I have no memories

♫Geese pass, leaving only regrets and cries♫

315
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,170

♫Our love was a mutual mistake♫

317
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,150
Since the time I can remember,

318
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,920
I've spent every day stationed at the border,

319
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:15,680
♫I sigh half my life, unable to leave the fog♫

320

either preparing for marches

321
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,630
or engaging in battles.

322
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,370
I've never experienced any other kind of life.

324
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,040

♫Burning the bitterness of parting♫

326
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,490

♫Looking back, life is but a dream♫

328

♫Leaving only love and hate to return to the dust♫

329
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
I was the daughter of a family of generals,

330
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,010
and that one day I might defend the country.

331
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,740
But now, I've grown up,

332
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,140
and I can't even protect my own father.

333
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,080
Weiyang,

334
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,420
don't blame yourself too much.

335
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,440
Rest assured.
