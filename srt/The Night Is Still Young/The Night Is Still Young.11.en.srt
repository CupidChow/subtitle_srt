[Calligraphy Forever]

4
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,750
Your Highness,

5
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,110
Her Highness practiced archery at the shooting range this morning.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,270
After lunch, she went to make some incense.

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,280
As usual,

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,010
she will go to the back mountain for flower arranging in the afternoon.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,710
Flower arranging with flower tea.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,170
Send her a pot of milk tea.

11
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,150
Yes.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Remember, do not-

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,090
Do not let Her Highness know

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,560
you're the one caring for her.

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,650
Your Highness,

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,240
you clearly want to be close to Her Highness,

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,050
yet you're suppressing yourself so hard.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,800
Can't you just love freely and

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,140
live for yourself once?

[Milk Tea]

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,810
My lady,

22
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,259
the milk tea

23
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,350
is something unique to the border regions.

24
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,740
Could it be that His Highness sent it to you?

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,729
His actions have nothing to do with me.

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,120
I knew Brother Beichen

27
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,990
would remember what I like to drink.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,639
If you like it, you can have it.

29
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,260
Of course.

30
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,230
Brother Beichen gave it to me.

31
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,280
How would I refuse?

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,660
I like tea,

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,750
so he brought this milk tea

34
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,670
all the way from the border regions.

35
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,940
I like flowers,

36
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,240
so he went to great lengths

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,850
to build this flower garden for me.

38
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,829
You don't need to tell me these things.

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,120
I just want to remind you

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,410
that only someone who cares would go to such lengths.

41
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,540
If it were just for personal gain,

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,680
he wouldn't have done so much.

43
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,010
It seems you are useful to Ye Beichen.

44
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,600
That's why you're allowed to live.

45
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,190
You-

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,829
Shut your mouth.

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,700
The position of Queen Yan will be mine sooner or later.

48
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,610
I don't care about the position

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
of Queen Yan at all.

50
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,300
If you want it,

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,390
just take it.

52
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,230
But if you try these little tricks again,

53
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,560
I won't allow it.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,480
Yue.

55
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,800
Your Highness,

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,220
should I go explain to Her Highness?

57
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,510
No need.

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

59
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,810
Bravo!

-Bravo!
-Bravo!

62
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,910
Bravo!

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,150
Weiyang.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,690
Weiyang.

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,970
Actually, that day...

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,270
Your thing had nothing to do with me.

67
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,579
Weiyang, listen to me carefully.

68
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,520
I know I was wrong.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,340
Watch out!

70
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,670
Ye Mingxuan, you-

71
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,400
Burns are serious.

72
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,670
You should get a royal doctor to check it

73
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,240
after you go back to your residence.

74
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,100
Weiyang,

75
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,079
it's been a long time since we've talked

76
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,410
so calmly like this.

77
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,880
I know

78
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,810
a lot has happened between us,

79
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,230
and you've had a lot of misunderstandings about me.

80
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,200
I feel like

81
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,810
I'm lost in a fog.

82
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,380
Are the misunderstandings you mentioned

83
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,850
really misunderstandings?

84
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,580
Weiyang,

85
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,490
you would think that way.

86
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,540
I guess it's because

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,830
Uncle has given you a lot of hints.

88
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,960
Have you ever considered

89
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,550
why so many things have happened recently,

90
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,120
all aimed at me?

91
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,150
Everything is so coincidental,

92
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,670
as if someone has arranged it,

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,930
just to make you misunderstand me.

94
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,780
Weiyang,

95
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,510
you and I have known each other

96
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,700
for a long time.

97
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,380
Don't you know

98
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,470
what kind of person I am?

99
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,990
Do you need someone else

100
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,770
to tell you?

101
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,830
Never mind.

102
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,940
Let's not talk about me.

103
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm still a prince after all,

104
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,430
not someone who can be easily framed.

105
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm more worried about you.

106
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,680
Uncle has always had designs on you.

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,310
With you staying by his side,

108
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,650
I can never be at ease.

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,400
I didn't blindly trust anyone.

110
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,540
This time,

111
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,040
I will find the answers myself.

112
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,510
If all of this is Uncle's intentional misguidance,

113
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,040
and you've been kept in the dark,

114
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,500
how can you see the truth?

115
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,300
Weiyang,

116
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,900
why don't you come with me?

117
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,100
I'll ask Father for his approval.

118
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,680
I can judge for myself

119
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,550
what kind of person Ye Beichen is.

120
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,860
I always believe

121
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,650
that the truth will never be covered up,

122
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,620
and lies will never become truth.

123
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,710
I will definitely find the answers.

124
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,200
You should get some rest.

125
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,550
Weiyang.

126
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,620
Weiyang.

127
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,950
I once thought you were like a flower in a mirror

128
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,390
or the moon in the water,

129
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,670

My dear daughter,

169
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,200
why have you come back?

170
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,940
It's because I missed you, Father.

171
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,070
Don't mix up these copper coins

172
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,390
on the table.

173
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,150
They're just some copper coins.

174
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,909
These are not ordinary copper coins.

175
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,900
Father, you're only focused on your work now.

176
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,150
A few copper coins are more important than me.

177
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,030
Sweetheart,

178
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,250
what's wrong?

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,750
Are you angry?

180
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,270
I just haven't had your

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,590
cherry pancakes for a long time.

182
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,030
And it's been a long time since I've gone

horseback riding and archery with you.

184
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,090
Alright, alright.

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,870
You should stay here for now.

186
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,280
I'll definitely cook for you,

187
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,460
and we'll go horseback riding and archery together.

188
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,470
It's a deal.

189
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,880
It's a deal.

190
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,950
Come on,

191
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,870
sweetheart,

192
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,110
have some tea.

193
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,850
Thank you, Father.

194
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,300
[King Yan's Mansion]

195
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,350
Your Highness, we've found a lead.

196
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,180
This is a batch of counterfeit coins found in the market.

197
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Someone has adulterated the copper needed

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
to make a real coin to make two fake ones.

199
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,530
This way, they can pocket the leftover copper.

200
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,440
These real and fake coins

201
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
look almost identical to the naked eye,

202
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,990
with only a slight difference in quality.

203
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,670
The coin molds

204
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,410
are usually strictly controlled by the royal family.

205
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,060
Now that so many counterfeit coins have flooded the market,

206
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,800
the power behind this cannot be underestimated.

207
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,910
Could it be the Fifth Prince again?

208
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,930
With all these incidents,

209
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,460
isn't he being a bit too hasty?

210
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,630
He's desperate and acting prematurely.

211
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,210
The matter of currency

212
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,890
is the foundation of the nation.

213
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,960
It cannot be taken lightly.

214
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,000
This time,

215
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,910
we can't let him find a scapegoat.

216
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,150
Yes.

217
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:23,910
Chu Mo,

218
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,860
order the Eagle Guard to prepare for action.

219
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,950
Monitor around the clock.

220
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,370
Yes, Your Highness.

221
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,820
The flowers I planted myself

222
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,240
might be drowned by your watering today.

223
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,440
The flowers in the General's mansion aren't that delicate.

224
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,150
His Majesty decreed today that

225
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,100
the princes should thoroughly investigate the counterfeit coin case.

226
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,860
It's also to assess the princes' abilities.

227
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,000
Whoever solves the case first

228
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,360
can become the Crown Prince.

229
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,850
The counterfeit coin case

230
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,670
is likely to stir up a storm of bloodshed again.

231
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,470
I'll be going to the palace in a few days.

232
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,480
I want to pick some nice flowers

233
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,940
to give to the princes.

234
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,560
Weiyang,

235
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,990
help me choose

236
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,610
which flowers would be appropriate.

237
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,910
Father, I don't know much about flowers.

238
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,120
Actually, flowers are a lot like people.

239
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,590
Look at this azalea.

240
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,540
Its fragrance is pervasive, and its temperament is elegant.

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,850
If we give it to that young prince with outstanding

242
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,070
demeanor and obvious brilliance,

243
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,980
it might be a good choice.

244
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,300
Now look at that plum blossom.

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,940
Its fragrance is subtle, and it stands proud in frost and snow.

246
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,790
It suits the elder prince with a resilient,

247
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,090
refined, and composed character.

248
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,630
Weiyang,

249
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,870
if we were

250
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,820
to give flowers to the future Crown Prince,

251
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,260
what flowers would be appropriate?

252
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,670
Father,

253
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,380
I don't care

254
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
who becomes the Crown Prince.

255
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,440
How could I possibly pick the right flowers?

256
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,680
Master, My lady.

257
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,380
Weiyang,

258
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,770
I heard from Yue

259
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,430
that you didn't eat properly yesterday.

260
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,020
Your body is the only thing that truly belongs to you.

261
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,660
No matter what happens,

262
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,000
or how bad you feel,

263
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,070
you must eat well.

264
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:34,930
General,

265
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,190
it's time for camp inspection.

266
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,140
I made this myself.

267
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,090
You must eat it.

268
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,260
I know.

269
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,340
The counterfeit coin case...

270
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,760
I remember it was at the lantern tower.

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Ye Beichen.

272
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,480
Ye Beichen, how dare you!

273
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,450
I am a king of a different surname appointed by the imperial court.

274
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
You have no right to arrest me.

275
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,970
The evidence is conclusive.

276
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,000
You've committed a crime punishable by execution of the entire clan.

277
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,510
Who said these coins are mine?

278
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,410
These are clearly the confiscated goods I seized.

279
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,770
Don't think I don't know where the account book is.

280
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,240
Then go find it.

281
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,220
Without evidence,

282
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,630
even if the King of Heaven came,

283
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,010
you couldn't convict me.

284
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,030
Lock him up first.

285
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,570
Yes.

286
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,400
Ye Beichen, Ye-

287
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,680
I have ways to make you confess.

288
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,890
-Go.
-Go

289
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,180
Weiyang, are you here to save me?

290
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,870
Feng Xuanyi.

291
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,150
If you want me to save you,

292
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,370
you need to tell me first

293
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,920
who you are colluding with.

294
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,110
That person is a big shot.

295
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,780
I dare not say his name out loud.

296
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,030
Watch out!

297
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,260
Weiyang, you're hurt.

298
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,210
Go!

299
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,200
You're covering up for the person behind this,

300
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,890
but he wants to kill you to silence you.

301
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,230
Feng Xuanyi,

302
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,610
if I hadn't been here today,

303
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,780
you would have been dead already.

304
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,090
Feng Xuanyi is an important lead.

305
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,080
Go protect him quickly.

306
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,650
Let's go.

307
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,150
Feng Xuanyi!

308
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,260
Feng Xuanyi!

309
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,720
Feng Xuanyi!

310
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,240
Weiyang?

311
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,390
Protect the Queen Yan!

312
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,050
Ye Beichen's people have already arrived.

313
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,440
Tonight's plan can't be carried out.

314
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,540
Arrows are blind. I can't risk hurting Weiyang.

315
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,440
Notify everyone to retreat quickly.

316
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,190
Yes.

317
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,400
Weiyang, come with me.

318
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,370
Weiyang!

319
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,740
Weiyang.

320
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,880
Weiyang, are you alright?

321
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,860
Come with me quickly.

322
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:47,980
Weiyang.

323
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,510
Chu Mo.

324
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,060
Ye Mingxuan.

325
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,060
Don't you have anything to defend yourself?

326
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,010
Uncle, what do you mean?

327
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,569
I just wanted to confirm

328
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,960
if King Xuannan was injured.

329
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
You don't have to pretend with me.

330
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,240
You clearly want to put Feng Xuanyi to death.

331
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,240
After all, dead men tell no tales.

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,130
Words are not proof.

333
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,359
Without evidence,

334
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,160
Uncle, you shouldn't make baseless accusations.

335
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,050
Feng Xuanyi himself is the evidence.

336
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,480
If you have time,

337
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,000
you should think about how to convict yourself

338
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,370
so that your punishment might be lighter.

339
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,880
How could you barge into my room?

340
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,540
Get out!

341
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,350
This is my mansion.

342
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,860

♫Memories linger, refusing to fade quietly♫

374
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,900
And he's the one who benefits from it all.

375
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,310
♫Time flies, and the love, hate, joy, sorrow♫

376
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,230
♫Partings and reunions come alive on the page♫

377
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,830
But Ye Mingxuan went there tonight

378
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,970
to save me.

379
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,660
♫A wish from the past life, fulfilled in this life♫

380
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,780
Have you ever considered

381
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,340
♫The world is eternal, and longing lasts long♫

382
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,310
why he went there?

383
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,390
♫Turn that unwillingness into meaning♫

384
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,370
Then why did you go there?

385
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,620
I...

386
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,730
♫Turn regret into sorrow♫

387
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,590
♫Time slowly tells the stories of the past♫

388
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,500
Don't move.
