♫The wind stirs the war flames, and the rain-soaked fur returns with the geese♫

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,370
♫In the capital, the pace of carriages and horses is slow♫

7
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,180
♫Several lifetimes of devotion, yet this bond remains unresolved♫

8
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,940
♫Entangled in grudges, love hangs by a thread♫

9
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,530
♫Unable to part with the eyes♫

10
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,030
♫I point to the moon, questioning beneath it, before the city tower♫

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,060
♫She's in red♫

12
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,960

♫A heart of purest jade♫

♫In the dim night, searching for her, past a thousand sails♫

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
♫Watching the snow fall, year after year♫

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,280
♫The song is not over, making a promise to grow old together♫

20

♫The night is still young, I will not betray the people♫

21

Your Majesty.

27
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,140
I've assigned more men

28
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,500
to strictly guard the gates of Ye City,

29
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,520
checking every one coming in and out.

30
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,270
We will definitely capture Ye Mingxuan and his accomplices.

31
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,900
Only ten days left.

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,960
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,870
Chu Mo,

34
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,060
you've been with me for so long.

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,620
You should know what I care about the most.

36
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,530
No matter what,

37
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,850
within ten days,

38
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,430
we must eliminate the threat of Ye Mingxuan

39
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,520
completely.

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,180
By the way,

42
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,450
how is the situation with

43
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,500
those princes?

44
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,770
I've sent people to investigate the princes

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
thoroughly.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,590
The Fourth Prince's mental condition is congenital,

47
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,829
and even Hua Tuo reborn

48
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,210
would struggle to cure it.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,620
The Sixth Prince, though talented,

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,130
is indulging in pleasure-seeking.

51
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,860
As for the Seventh Prince,

52
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,300
despite his young age,

53
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,290
he has the best character.

54
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,380
His writings are brilliant,

55
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,840
and his horsemanship and archery skills are among the best.

56
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,200
This Seventh Prince is not bad.

57
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,110
By the way,

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,030
you need to continue to

59
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,570
secretly observe those court ministers.

60
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,130
The regent ministers are crucial.

61
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:00,970
Yes.

62
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,970
My lady.

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,740
It's alright.

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
My lady,

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,860
the Imperial Affairs Department takes care of this specifically.

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,440
Why bother yourself?

67
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,950
The secret recipe for making soft armor by the Shangguan's army

68
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,270
is a unique formula,

69
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,000
even unknown to the Imperial Affairs Department.

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,270
There's no need to rush.

71
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,950
It's been cold for so many days.

72
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,290
Today, there are finally some sunshine.

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,830
Why don't we go for a walk?

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,810
Yeah,

75
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,310
the coldest winter is about to pass.

76
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,050
Counting the days,

77
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,440
it's only ten days left.

78
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,490
Why are you in the mood for painting today?

79
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,260
I won't show you.

80
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,930
Look over there.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,370
You painted epiphyllum?

82
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,580
An unfinished painting

83
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,909
is not for others to appreciate.

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,850
Then I've come at just the right time.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,080
We can paint together.

86
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,070
Capturing both form and spirit.

87
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
That's great.

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,740
However beautiful this epiphyllum is,

89
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,940
its beauty lasts only for a moment.

90
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,410
But as long as it has bloomed freely,

91
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,240
why care about how long it lasts?

92
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,170
That's true.

93
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,790
As long as we're happy in the moment we have,

94
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,390
that's enough.

95
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,200
Don't you think so?

96
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,320
As long as when we think of the epiphyllum,

97
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,440
we recall its most beautiful form,

98
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,490
that's all that matters.

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,580
Your Majesty!

100
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
What brings you all here?

103
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,780
Your Majesty,

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,780
although the traitor Ye Mingxuan has been wanted,

105
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,100
his remnants are still lurking in the palace.

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,780
If they are not completely eradicated,

107
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,250
the poison of these remnants cannot be eliminated,

108
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,460
posing a great threat.

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,650
Ye Mingxuan's accomplices in the palace

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,590
have long been eliminated.

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,520
What remnants are you talking about?

112
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,140
Your Majesty,

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,550
the woman who almost became Ye Mingxuan's Crown Princess

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,010
is now accompanying you.

115
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,700
They never got married,

116
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,450
so there is no such Crown Princess!

117
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,210
Although they weren't married,

118
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,920
it was widely known.

119
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,000
Your Majesty, keeping Shangguan Weiyang by your side

120
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,370
is not only against propriety

121
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,050
but also dangerous for you!

122
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,740
Shangguan Weiyang

123
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,909
was bestowed upon me as a consort by the late emperor!

124
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,600
But you were not married at the time.

125
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,840
This matter needs no further discussion.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,880
All of you should focus on your own duties.

127
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,010
My private affairs need no more concern.

128
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,580
Your Majesty,

129
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,570
this memorial is jointly submitted by all the senior officials.

130
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,220
The traitors plotted against Your Majesty,

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,790
nearly causing turmoil in the court and country.

132
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,750
For the sake of the Great Ye and

133
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,460
for the safety of the people,

134
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,940
we implore Your Majesty to banish the remnants from the palace

135
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,340
and never allow them to set foot in Ye City again.

136
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,630
We implore Your Majesty to prioritize the welfare of the state!

137
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,350
Please, Your Majesty, prioritize the welfare of the state.

138
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,700
What if I refuse?

139
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,030
We are all dedicated to the court

140
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,050
and to Your Majesty.

141
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,650
Please consider this carefully, Your Majesty!

142
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,640
Please consider this carefully, Your Majesty.

143
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,309
Your Majesty!

144
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,429
Your Majesty!

145
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:41,990
Your Majesty!

146
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,909
Your Majesty!

147
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,010
Thinking about it,

148
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,810
the foreign ministers coming to congratulate the new emperor

149
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,070
should be arriving soon.

150
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,980
My lady, what's wrong?

151
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,570
I heard that

152
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,720
Lord Zhang and the others plan

153
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,250
to keep kneeling in the Imperial Garden.

154
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,700
But don't worry,

155
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,020
His Majesty has already sent Chu Mo to handle it.

156
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,130
I'm not worried.

157
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,240
His Majesty won't harm these senior officials.

158
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,360
When the time comes,

159
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,010
I will also give them an explanation.

160
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,170
Then why do you still look so worried?

161
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,390
There are many state affairs.

162
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,070
The burden on his shoulders is too heavy.

163
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,030
Yet I can't do anything for him.

164
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,460
I think

165
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,880
as long as His Majesty sees you,

166
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,960
he'll surely be happy.

167
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,910
His birthday is coming soon.

168
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,020
I should do something for him.

169
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,840
Your Majesty,

170
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,570
Miss Shangguan said she's waiting for you in the flower forest.

282
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,960
My father once said

283
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,230
that the military tally must be

284
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,900

285

Now that you've ascended the throne,

Although Ye Mingxuan is in hiding,

296
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,440
he must have sent people to watch in secret.

297
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,230
As long as the military tally of Shangguan's army

298
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,040

299
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,690
