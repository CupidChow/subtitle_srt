[Episode 29]

3
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,100
In this life,

4
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,650
everyone is bound by circumstances beyond their control.

5
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,430
I hope in his next life,

6
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,770
he won't be born into a noble family again.

7
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,000
Ye Beichen,

8
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,140
I don't really want to go to Yunnan with him.

9
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,220
I...

10
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,789
Weiyang,

11
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,140
I understand everything.

12
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,530
Weiyang,

13
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,870
I know why you want to leave the palace.

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,410
Do you think

15
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,539
only one of us can survive?

16
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,570
I hope

17
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,560
this time,

18
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,710
you will be the one to survive.

19
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,660
This time,

20
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,340
both of us can survive.

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,710
What do you mean?

22
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,760
The Life and Death Gu

23
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,990
has a solution now.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,300
Burn brighter!

25
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,490
Brighter.

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,440
Burn! Burn!

27
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,090
I'm burnt! I'm burnt!

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,810
What did I forget?

29
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,460
Old Poison Freak?

30
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,440
Last time we met, you were on your last breath

31
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,750
This time, your face is like a peach blossom.

32
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,370
What a healthy, rosy complexion!

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,570
Old Poison Freak,

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,160
I came as soon as I received the news.

35
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,700
Have you truly unraveled the mystery of the Life and Death Gu?

36
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,200
My only wish in this life

37
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,550
is to break this Gu.

38
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,340
This time, in seclusion,

39
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,200
I finally found a way to break it.

40
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,260
This cauldron is called Huayuan Cauldron.

41
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,150
It's forged from the five elements of heaven and earth.

42
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,910
Decades of my efforts

43
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,190
were all poured into this.

44
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,500
It can devour all poisons in the world.

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,660
Then, let's begin.

46
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,120
Both of you, please hold out your hands.

47
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,380
The Life and Death Gu worms...

48
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,880
Weiyang,

49
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,020
you're awake.

50
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,820
Is the Life and Death Gu really lifted?

51
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,410
The Life and Death Gu worms went into the Huayuan Cauldron

52
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,430
and were turned to ashes.

53
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,820
So,

54
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,550
we'll never be separated by life and death again.

55
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,550
We can both live.

56
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,330
In this lifetime,

57
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,990
I will never let you leave me.

58
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,170
Your Majesty,

59
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,010
I have investigated the assassins from that night.

60
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,940
It can be confirmed

61
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,010
that those people were all assassins sent by Ye Mingxuan.

62
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,920
Where is Ye Mingxuan now?

63
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,470
As per Your Majesty's instructions,

64
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,510
I have sent people

65
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,230
to secretly investigate all the temples in Ye City.

66
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,260
Indeed, we found him hiding in Xiangyun Temple.

67
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,300
We're just waiting for Your Majesty's order

68
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,310
to lead men to capture him immediately.

69
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,980
There's no rush.

70
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,980
If he dares to return to Ye City,

71
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,830
he must have other plans.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,630
We must not alert him.

73
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,240
Wait for the viper to make its move,

74
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,390
then we'll catch it in one fell swoop.

75
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,490
I obey Your Majesty's command.

76
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,620
When I fought him before,

77
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,750
I found his skills have become even more formidable.

78
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,980
I'm afraid he has mastered

79
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,330
the evil techniques taught by the Sorcerer King.

80
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,900
This battle will surely be dangerous.

81
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,070
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
The Eagle Guards swear to protect Your Majesty with our lives.

83
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,300
[Order]

84
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,900
Your Majesty.

85
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,580
[Order]

86
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,770
The Eagle Guard token can mobilize all Eagle Guards in Great Ye.

87
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,810
Your Majesty.

88
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,790
The Eagle Guards were personally trained by you.

89
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,260
The Eagle Guards have always only recognized you, not the token.

90
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,060
Chu Mo, you must remember,

91
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,830
from today on,

92
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,980
seeing this token is the same as seeing me.

93
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,900
Whoever holds this token

94
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,420
will be the master of the Eagle Guards.

95
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,140
The Eagle Guards must protect her with their lives.

96
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,030
Your Majesty.

97
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,410
You...

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,710
You're not going to disobey my orders, are you?

99
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,270
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

100
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,100
By the way,

101
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,310
how are the matters I instructed you to handle?

102
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,010
I have arranged everything as instructed.

103
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,760
The Seventh Prince has passed the assessment.

104
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,210
The four regent ministers

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,210
are also loyal and devoted.

106
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,520
They serve the country with utmost loyalty.

107
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,970
Good.

108
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,140
I can now write the edict of abdication.

109
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,100
The harsh winter has passed.

110
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,679
Spring is coming.

111
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,830
Weiyang,

112
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,429
when the next spring snow falls,

113
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,090
perhaps

114
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,650
it will be the day of our eternal parting.

115
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,040
How is the new silk in the palace?

116
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,950
Does it look good?

117
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,430
It looks beautiful.

118
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,820
You're more beautiful than the flowers.

119
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,120
Weiyang,

120
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,000
I have something to give you.

121
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,220
You've given me enough things already.

122
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,870
My room can't hold any more things.

123
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,900
[Order]

124
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,860
What's this?

125
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,250
Chu Mo.

126
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,050
Greetings, Your Majesty.

127
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,420
I am Chu Mo, leader of the Eagle Guards.

128
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,500
Greetings, Master of the Eagle Guards.

129
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,390
This is the Eagle Guard token.

130
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,660
From now on,

131
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,100
all Eagle Guards are under your command.

132
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,170
The Eagle Guards were personally trained by me.

133
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,810
It took decades of painstaking effort.

134
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,980
They are absolutely loyal and reliable.

135
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,230
The Eagle Guards have always only followed your orders.

136
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,520
Why are you suddenly giving this to me?

137
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,780
Ye Beichen,

138
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,590
are you hiding something from me?

139
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,020
Now, I have the Imperial Guards at my disposal.

140
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,400
It's not the same as before.

141
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,240
The Eagle Guards originally belonged to me personally.

142
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,680
They can protect you perfectly.

143
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,780
Come.

144
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,000
Remember, when you use it,

145
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,530
you must bend your hand.

146
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,910
Aim at a target.

147
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,080
There's actually a hidden weapon inside!

148
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,940
Come. Let's try another one.

149
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,720

00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,440
♫A wish from the past life, fulfilled in this life♫

188
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,220
♫The world is eternal, and longing lasts long♫

189
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,010
What I just taught you,

190
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,330
you must remember.

191
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,100
Practice diligently. Don't forget it.

192
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,170
♫Turn that unwillingness into meaning♫

193
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,650
Understand?

194
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,510
♫Turn regret into sorrow♫

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,530
Once I've mastered it,

196
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,240
let's see if you still dare to bully me.

197
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,450
♫Time slowly tells the stories of the past♫

198
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,630
I've cracked it!

199
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,250
I've finally cracked it.

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,500
So, the Life and Death Gu can really be broken.

201
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,560
Grand Master.

202
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,060
Oh, it's you.

203
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,010
Grand Master,

204
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,300
I heard you've developed a

205
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,150
Huayuan Cauldron that can break the Life and Death Gu.

206
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,510
I've come specially to learn from you.

207
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,340
This Huayuan Cauldron

208
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,600
was just a show for Ye Beichen.

209
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,180
However,

210
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,460
my decades of hard work haven't been in vain.

211
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,250
just now,

212
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,990
I've found a way to crack the Life and Death Gu.

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Really?

214
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,250
Grand Master,

215
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,610
may I have the honor of witnessing it?

216
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,430
This matter doesn't concern you.

217
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,930
You... You...

218
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,140
You...

219
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,560
You... You dare to betray your masters!

220
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,890
Such treachery!

221
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,150
You...

222
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,640
You... You shouldn't have figured out the true way.

223
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,170
Once you're dead,

224
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,650
there will be no one left in the world who can break this curse.

225
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,450
Now,

226
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,030
I'm the only one in the world who can break this curse.

227
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,200
Shangguan Weiyang,

228
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,960
you're doomed.

229
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,460
Ye Beichen,

230
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,410
every day, you're either handling state affairs or accompanying me.

231
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,100
Don't you find it boring?

232
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,660
A little bit.

233
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,510
If you could give me a dozen or so princes,

234
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,100
I'd have plenty to keep me busy.

235
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,490
Who says I'm giving you princes?

236
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,560
From what you're saying,

237
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,240
you only like boys.

238
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,860
Don't you like girls?

239
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,640
How could that be?

240
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,370
If you have boys,

241
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,670
I'll teach them to read.

242
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,200
If you have girls,

243
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,220
you can teach them horse riding and archery.

244
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,970
Did you mix the two up?

245
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,200
Because I think

246
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,670
girls should be like you,

247
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,370
free

248
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,270
and unrestrained.

249
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,540
I also hope the boys will be like you,

250
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,710
gentle as jade,

251
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,270
and clever as can be.

252
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,240
It's just that

253
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,960
it'd be better if they weren't so deeply emotional.

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,020
Even if we had to do it all over again,

255
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,970
I would still make the same choice.

256
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,890
I don't want to do it again.

257
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,760
I only want this life, this world.

258
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,960
The current Emperor Ye Beichen killed his brother to usurp the throne

259
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,780
and harmed the princes.

260
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,050
Everyone in Great Ye has the right to execute him.

261
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,990

the backlash from the Gu worm is getting worse.

281

It's okay.

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,320
