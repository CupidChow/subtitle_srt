How did Father start to improve?

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,020
This was intentionally done by me.

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,410
You'd better explain yourself clearly.

86
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,490
You went to great lengths to find me.

87
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,980
If we don't let the Emperor show some improvement,

88
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,650
how can we silence the rumors?

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,170
First, let the Emperor show some improvement,

90
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,650
then let him be beyond medical help.

91
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,200
This is the true meaning of the last flicker before the flame dies out.

92
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,480
My lady, it really is His Highness?

93
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,659
My lady,

94
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,450
why is His Highness helping the Crown Prince

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,520
to harm the Emperor?

96
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,180
He must be planning something.

97
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,840
The Sorcerer King is no longer of one mind with me.

98
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,920
We can't keep him any longer.

99
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,680
But the Sorcerer King is skilled in using poisons,

100
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,540
and his martial arts are good, too.

101
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,960
It might not be easy to kill him.

102
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,220
Then, we'll strike him decisively

103
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,040
when he's off guard.

104
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,970
Keep a close eye on him now.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,440
Yes.

106
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,030
Ye Mingxuan is now suspicious.

107
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,190
And there's no time to notify Ye Beichen.

108
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,200
Even if Ye Beichen escapes today,

109
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,440
he will still be in danger.

110
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,270
Sorcerer King, thanks to you today,

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,540
my great cause will soon be accomplished.

112
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,570
I'll drink first as a toast.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,650
Although this wine is good,

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,400
it's still brewed from mundane ingredients.

115
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,950
I fear it might affect my cultivation.

116
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,070
I happen to have brought a wine.

117
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,740
It is called Drunken Immortal Wine.

118
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,790
It's brewed with the essence of the five elements.

119
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,500
It's particularly helpful for balancing body and mind.

120
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,080
I've brought it specially to share with you, Crown Prince.

121
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,910
I also hope your great cause succeeds soon.

122
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,340
Fine wine paired with delicious food.

123
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,419
This meat is the tenderest cut from the cow's back.

124
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,500
It's most suitable for you to eat, Sorcerer King.

125
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,870
Indeed, it's premium beef.

126
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,300
But unfortunately,

127
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,590
it conflicts with my immortal elixir.

128
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,350
I'm not fortunate enough to enjoy it.

129
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,160
I clearly didn't touch any of his food or drink.

130
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,200
How could this be?

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,740
Crown Prince,

132
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,230
this is the Numbing Immortal Grass

133
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,980
I had people find from foreign lands.

134
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,550
Once someone gets close,

135
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,150
its fragrance can make one dizzy and weak.

136
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,420
Given Ji Wuming's cunning nature,

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,220
he will definitely have guessed that today's banquet is a trap.

138
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,770
He definitely won't touch any food or drink.

139
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,670
So, I'll do the opposite.

140
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,290
I'll put the antidote to this poisonous grass in the food and drink.

141
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,150
When he smells the poisonous grass and is unable to defend himself…

142
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,030
Your Highness,

143
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,940
I can't hold my liquor well.

144
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,710
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

145
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,930
I'll retire to rest first.

146
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,750

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,120
are you trying to keep me out of it

163

and deal with Ye Mingxuan alone?

164
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,170
After coming back, you went to great lengths

165
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,310
just to have Ye Mingxuan send me out of the palace.

166
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,020
You clearly wanted me to

167
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,130

to ruin my plans.

171
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,370
Since you already have a plan,

172
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,470
you should tell me about it.

173
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,080
I'm more familiar with the current situation.

♫This empty city is so regrettable without you♫

186
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,770
We are bound together in life and death.

187
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,280
If anything really happens to you,

188
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,930
♫Even if the skies fall♫

189
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,120
I won't live on alone in this world.

190
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,150
♫Covering my eyes♫

191
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:39,260
♫In the next life, no more separations♫

192
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,300
You disguised yourself as the Sorcerer King to get close to Ye Mingxuan.

193
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,110
Haven't you thought that you might be in danger

194
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,100
if you were exposed?

195
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,850
So what if I'm in danger?

196
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,780
Eliminating traitors

197
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,450
is my duty.

198
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,110
You still haven't told me

199
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,660
how you became the Sorcerer King.

200
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,720
[Half a month ago]

201
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,240
Your Highness,

202
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,900
I have investigated the situation.

203
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,750
Ye Mingxuan has sent people to contact Ji Wuming multiple times,

204
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,500
inviting him to the palace to treat the Emperor's illness.

205
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,810
Who is this Ji Wuming?

206
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,680
He's skilled in astrology and divination

207
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,490
and knows quite a bit about unorthodox practices.

208
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,640
He's known as the Sorcerer King.

209
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,810
I want to meet this Ji Wuming.

210
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,540
What's your relationship with Ye Mingxuan?

211
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,270
I once saved his life

212
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,390
and taught him martial arts for self-protection.

213
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
Why did he summon you to the palace?

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,760
Speak!

215
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,520
The Emperor...

216
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,790
The Emperor is in a coma.

217
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,380
He wants to use me

218
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,000
to quietly make the Emperor pass away.

219
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,780
That's all I know.

220
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,030
Please spare my life.

221
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,180
You used human blood for your cultivation.

222
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,560
You deserve death.

223
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,810
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,030
I hurt you.

225
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,890
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,680
I knew…

227
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,690
you did that to protect me.

228
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,220
That day, when I received the news,

229
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,660
I immediately rushed to the Lantern Tower,

230
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,030
but I was still one step behind Ye Mingxuan.

231
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,540
[Shaobing]

232
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,110
At that time, I was afraid that any rash move

233
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,080
might put you in danger.

234
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,710
Even though it was minimal,

235
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,720
I still received

236
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,120
a certain message from your eyes.

237
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,520
So, I firmly believed

238
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,000
that your arrow

239
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,150
would only hit the arrowhead on my chest.

240
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,080
So, I went along with the plan

241
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,200
and took the opportunity to fake my death.

242
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,580
I used a death row inmate's body to make a clean escape

243
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,930
and planned for the long term.

244
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,420
When Ye Mingxuan let his guard down,

245
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,390
I will then devise a plan to capture him.

246
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,970
So, you didn't reveal your identity to me,

247
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,040
and you even asked Ye Mingxuan to eliminate me.

248
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,370
It was because you were worried that exposing yourself

249
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,070
might make Ye Mingxuan harm me?

250
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,880
Ye Mingxuan and Ji Wuming are close friends.

251
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,980
I must be extremely cautious.

252
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,670
But he's very suspicious.

253
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,800
Now that the Emperor has just shown signs of improvement,

254
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,210
he no longer trusts you.

255
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,370
Tonight's banquet

256
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,490
is his attempt to eliminate you.

257
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,510
Don't worry.

258
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,230
He can't kill me with his abilities.

259
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,230
But now, the Eastern Palace is full of dangers.

260
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,660
You must leave the palace as soon as possible.

261
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,400
I don't understand what you're thinking

262
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,590
or what you want to do.

263
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,460
This is the real danger.

264
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,380
If you don't want me to be in danger again,

265
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,140
then tell me your plans.

266
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,930
Your Highness, you still need to rest well.

267
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,670
I take my leave.

268
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,090
Your Highness,

269
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,380
we've searched the entire palace

270
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,130
but couldn't find him.

271
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,390
It seems the Sorcerer King was prepared.

272
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,820
Ji Wuming!

273
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,710
Send everyone out.

274
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,570
I must have his life.

275
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,270
Yes.

276
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,720
I have been investigating this matter for a long time

277
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,120
before finally figuring it out.

278
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,460
When you entered the Emperor's bedchamber,

279
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,800
did you find anything?

280
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,290
I discovered that

281
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,970
the Emperor is in a coma

282
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,490
because Ye Mingxuan

283
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,010
inserted soul-breaking needles

284
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,770
into all the major acupoints all over his body.

285
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,490
Moreover, near the bedchamber,

286
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,490
he set up multiple barriers

287
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,270
and traps.

288
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,490
Rushing in recklessly

289
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,670
would only harm the Emperor.

290
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,810
So,

291
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,329
our current plan

292
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,270
should be to rescue the Emperor first,

293
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,940
then deal with Ye Mingxuan.

294
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,089
Correct.

295
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,609
After the Emperor wakes up,

296
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,339
I will issue an edict to arrest Ye Mingxuan.

297
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,480
Executing a rebellious prince

298
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,440
won't affect the foundation of Great Ye.

299
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,530
If the Emperor passes away,

300
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,200
Ye Mingxuan will legitimately inherit the throne.

301
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,600
Trying to take him down then

302
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,980
would surely cause a great upheaval.

303
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,650
I fear the people would be in fear,

304
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,610
and the empire of the Great Ye would be on the verge of collapse.

305
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,600
I'll rescue the Emperor with you.

306
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,790
There's no need.

307
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,810
I have my own plans for this matter.

308
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,860
This matter concerns not only our safety,

309
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,310
but also the Great Ye's future.

310
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,010
No matter how dangerous it is,

311
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,780
I will stand with you through it all.

312
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,150
Weiyang.

313
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,840
Crown Prince,

314
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,080
we've received an urgent report from 800 li away.

315
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,790
Go ahead!

316
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,720
The body of Ji Wuming, the Sorcerer King, has been found.

317
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,070
He's been killed for several days.

318
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,420
It seems someone deliberately impersonated the Sorcerer King,

319
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,590
intending to cause trouble right under your nose.

320
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,240
If Your Highness wishes to keep Miss Shangguan,

321
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,540
you must send her out of the palace.

322
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,050
Ye Beichen!
