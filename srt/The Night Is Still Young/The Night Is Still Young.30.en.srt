00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,760
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,530
It smells so good.

4
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,780
Ye Beichen will surely love this tea.

5
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,870
You don't really think

6
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,700
that both you and Brother Beichen can survive, do you?

7
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,789
Huan Yan?

8
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,800
You don't know yet, do you?

9
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,210
Brother Beichen has led his men to capture Ye Mingxuan.

10
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,550
Ye Mingxuan has prepared a grand gift

11
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,940
for him.

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,670
Ye Mingxuan's evil deeds are numerous,

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,150
condemned by both heaven and earth.

14
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,550
You, colluding with him,

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,350
won't end up well.

16
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,930
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,620
Ye Mingxuan has escaped from the Xiangyun Temple.

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,530
Were there any accomplices?

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,220
We haven't discovered any yet.

20
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,330
Wait for his remaining accomplices to appear and capture them all at once.

21
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,420
Yes.

22
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,890
Look at what this is.

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,690
The Huayuan Cauldron?

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,500
Brother Beichen, in order to quietly

25
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,650
die in your place,

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,130
even dared to make up such a lie.

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,820
He truly is the world's greatest romantic.

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,550
I've said it before.

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,300
If you don't want Brother Beichen to die,

30
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,380
there is a way.

31
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,780
The way remains the same.

32
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,640
You die now.

33
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,660
Ye Mingxuan is a treacherous rebel.

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,030
As the daughter of the Imperial Advisor,

35
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,250
how dare you collude with him?

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,450
I don't care who Ye Mingxuan is.

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,890
Whoever can help me kill you,

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,730
I'll cooperate with them.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,020
Where has Ye Mingxuan lured Ye Beichen to?

40
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Tell me.

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,470
Ye Beichen!

42
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,870
I am the true heir to the throne.

43
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,010
You falsified imperial edicts and usurped the throne. 
Your crimes are punishable by death!

44
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Weiyang!

45
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,880
Weiyang!

46
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,490
Weiyang.

47
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,170
Weiyang!

48
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,900
Weiyang.

49
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,430
Ye Beichen.

50
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,340
Killing your beloved with your own hands,

51
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,950
how does that feel?

52
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,080
Ye Beichen!

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,080
Ye Beichen! Ye Beichen!

54
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,740
Ye Mingxuan!

55
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,520
Ye Beichen!

56
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,810
Ye Beichen!

57
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,690
Ye Mingxuan!

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
Ye Mingxuan,

59
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,100
we had a deal

60
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,560
that you were not allowed to harm Brother Beichen!

61
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,420
What on earth happened?

62
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,550
The blood has rushed to his head.

63
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,610
Now,

64
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,640
the Gu worms have turned against him within his body.

65
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,230
Weiyang, you've come at the right time.

66
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,840
I want you to witness with your own eyes

67
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,710
how I execute Ye Beichen.

68
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,100
But don't worry.

69
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,900
After I ascend to rule the country,

70
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,810
there will certainly be a place for you in my harem.

71
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,930
Ye Mingxuan, I'll kill you!

72
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,720
Weiyang!

73
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,940
Weiyang.

74
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,540
Weiyang, Weiyang.

75
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,440
Are you alright?

76
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,350
I'm fine.

77
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,360
That's good.

78
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,440
Weiyang.

79
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,390
Ye Mingxuan has colluded with Huan Yan

80
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,180
and mastered an evil technique.

81
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,890
As long as you're alright.

82
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,760
Ye Beichen.

83
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,740
I'll make you experience death

84
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,330
while you're fully conscious.

85
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,970
No.

86
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,190
Wait for me.

87
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,600
Ye Beichen.

88
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,950
Don't.

89
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,980
Treacherous rebel,

90
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,540
remnant of traitors,

91
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,790
even if Heaven wants to spare you today,

92
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,470
I will still take your miserable life!

93
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,140
I am heaven's chosen one!

94
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,790
If you want to change the mandate of heaven,

95
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,260
let's see what you've got!

96
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,540
Anyone who dares make a move,

97
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,980
and I'll kill her.

98
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,270
If you dare to hurt him, I won't spare you.

99
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,620
You think too highly of your abilities.

100
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,450
Huan Yan!

101
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,670
Brother Beichen.

102
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,260
You must live on.

103
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,590
Remember,

104
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,560
life is death,

105
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,260
and death is life.

106
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,120
No!

107
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,160
Huan Yan!

108
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,010

Weiyang.

110
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,310
Weiyang.

111

Ye Beichen!

112
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,780
No.

113
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,610
Such profound love, moving the heavens,

114
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,100
as enduring as gold.

115
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,860
Isn't it bound

116
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,110
that one of you must die so the other can survive?

I'll spare the life of

120
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,540
whoever survives.

188
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,630
you still remember to sacrifice your life

189
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,890
for mine.

190
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,910
♫The fate of love and hate, separation and union♫

191

♫Blame the depth of our love♫

192
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,780
I'm here.

193
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,610
♫Meeting you feels like encountering an old friend♫

194
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,420
I'm here.

195
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,510
♫As if in a past life, passing by the door♫

196
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,350
♫The past is hard to keep, attachment leaves no trace♫

197

♫How can I join you in this life♫

198
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,870
Don't cry.

199

Ye Beichen.

200
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,860
♫If the soul doesn't cross, if the person doesn't return♫

201

You used to protect me.

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,880
♫Could you lend me the rise and fall of the next life♫

203

This time,

204

let me protect you instead.

♫If fate protects us♫

♫Eternal love through the ages♫

215
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,150
You must live on well.

216
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,400
This is my only wish.

217
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,490
If there's a next life,

218
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,190
I must find you first,

219
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,910
okay?

220
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,950
♫Who inquires amidst the dim lights♫

221
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,610

Why are you here?

229

How could I let you marry someone else?

230
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,720
Ye Beichen.

231
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,660
You still have me in your heart, don't you?

232
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,260
No matter what the future holds

233
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,520
or how our story ends,

234
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,960
♫The wind stirs the war flames, and the rain-soaked fur returns with the geese♫

235
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,950
at least at this moment,

236
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,050
we only have eyes for each other.

237
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,520
♫In the capital, the pace of carriages and horses is slow♫

238
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,290
If it snows tomorrow,

239
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,260
♫Several lifetimes of devotion, yet this bond remains unresolved♫

240
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,710
you have to grant me one request,

241
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,260
and you can't go back on your word.

242
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,120
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

243
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,030
♫Entangled in grudges, love hangs by a thread♫

244
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,200
And what if I lose?

245
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,740
You're not allowed to question me anymore

246
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,740
♫Unable to part with the eyes♫

247
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,300
and must obey me unconditionally.

248
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,250
Thank you.

249
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,020
♫I point to the moon, questioning beneath it, before the city tower♫

250
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,750
If it weren't for you,

251
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,030
I would still be living in lies and being used.

♫She's in red♫

254

Was it worth risking your life

♫With angry eyes, a word severs grudges♫

256
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,060
to draw the poison from me into yourself?

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,310
You are my Queen.

258

♫A sword in the heart, a farewell waves over the land♫

259

♫This life has slipped away, the next life will be complete♫

261

Anyone who dares to harm her

262
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,420
will face death!

263
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,940
Neither able to live

♫Watching the snow fall, year after year♫

Your only way out now

Ye Beichen,

275
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,400
you dare take advantage of the Emperor's illness

276
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,000
to seize power

277
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,609
and usurp the throne.

278
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,220
All soldiers, hear my command!

279

King Yan has rebelled.

280

His crime deserves death.

Show no mercy!

282
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,090
Hand over Shangguan Weiyang,

283
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,690
