00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,660
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,290
He's not just your royal uncle,

4
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,510
but also a prince personally conferred by the late Emperor.

5
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,100
Do you want to die?

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,420
Father,

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,510
does being a prince

8
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,450
give him the right to seize love by force?

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,650
What's the use of a prince's identity, glory, and wealth?

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,640
I can give them all up.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,930
I only want Weiyang.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,580
You're truly useless.

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,960
Is there nothing in your heart besides romantic sentiments?

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,080
I envy the life of a couple but not a lonely and immortal life.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,360
In this life,

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,780
I will only grow old with Weiyang.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,220
So what if I've made a grave mistake?

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,650
Even if I were given another chance,

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,750
-I would still do the same!
-Enough!

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,500
You've been blinded by love for the moment.

21
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,990
Your royal uncle won't stoop to your level.

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,630
Go back to your residence and reflect on your actions.

23
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,770
Without my decree,

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,930
you are not allowed to go anywhere.

25
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,020
Father,

26
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,400
but Weiyang...

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,520
How can an imperial decree be changed so casually?

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,830
From now on, Weiyang's marriage is not to be mentioned again.

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,930
You may leave.

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,750
Father.

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,430
Leave!

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,470
I'll take my leave.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,150
He actually attempted to assassinate a prince for a woman.

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,060
Mingxuan

35
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,730
truly has no tact at all.

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,090
The Fifth Prince is indeed a bit impulsive.

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,840
But I didn't expect

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,060
that King Yan would misjudge someone.

39
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,990
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,329
Your Majesty.

[The Daughter of the Imperial Advisor, Huan Yan]

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,190
Huan Yan?

43
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,070
[Past Life]

44
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,590
Huan Yan is the daughter of the Imperial Advisor.

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,710
Born with a unique constitution,

46
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,860
she studied extraordinary arts under a reclusive master.

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,830
However, her personality

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,340
is unpredictable;

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,960
she's always been at odds with me.

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,880
Shangguan Weiyang.

51
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,730
Ye Mingxuan.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,100
So you're the Queen Yan appointed by the Emperor?

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,510
You don't seem all that special to me.

54
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,280
So you're the daughter of the Imperial Advisor?

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,310
You're quite ordinary too.

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,400
Do you see these brushes and scriptures?

57
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,060
They're all prepared for you.

58
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,160
What do you mean?

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,970
Brother Beichen, as a prince,

60
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,370
is of unparalleled prestige.

61
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,550
Since you've hurt him,

62
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,260
you must show true sincerity

63
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,210
by using blood and ink

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,310
to copy scriptures and pray for blessings.

65
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,400
What happened between him and me

66
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,750
is none of your business.

67
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,420
Raise your hand.

68
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,070
You...

69
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,000
Stop!

70
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,530
What's going on?

71
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,660
What happened?

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,950
How did this happen?

73
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,810
Brother Beichen,

74
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,460
it's just a minor injury.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,190
Please don't get angry

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,330
and harm your own body.

77
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,790
That's right.

78
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,180
You were the one who told me to copy scriptures

79
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,230
with blood and ink to pray for blessings.

80
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,140
How did you end up cutting your own hand?

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,230
It seems your little tricks no longer work.

82
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,159
As long as it helps Brother Beichen recover,

83
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,409
I'm willing to do anything.

84
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,220
There's no need for that.

85
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,930
I don't want her blood to taint the purity of King Yan's Mansion.

86
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,040
With such a wicked woman in King Yan's Mansion,

87
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,630
it probably hasn't been pure for a long time.

88
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,180
And you still want to use this to harm me?

89
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,070
Then I'll settle both new and old grudges at once.

90
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,660
From now on, don't pull these tricks

91
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,250
in the King Yan's Mansion.

92
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,070
I know I was wrong.

93
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,280
I shouldn't have lost my composure

94
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,700
upon hearing that you were injured.

95
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,760
Master,

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,120
I had thought that with the informant tipping us off,

97
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,710
we could seize the Gu worm matured by Ye Beichen,

98
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,640
keeping the Emperor in a coma

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
and under my control.

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,050
But I never expected Ye Beichen to strike back again,

101
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,910
and even allow General Shangguan

102
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,210
to successfully deliver the matured Gu worm to him.

103
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,290
Although the Emperor has now awakened,

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,490
he still, like everyone else,

105
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,810
believes you are indifferent to worldly affairs.

106
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,040
You can continue plotting your grand plans in secret.

107
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,510
Ye Beichen's return to the capital this time

108
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,390
has been aggressive.

109
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,550
He's targeted me several times

110
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,330
and even intentionally exposed my wound in front of Weiyang.

111
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,030
Could it be

112
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,450
that he has found something out?

113
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,710
In my opinion,

114
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,130
no matter how clever King Yan is,

115
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,460
he could never guess that you possess such extraordinary skills,

116
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,560
able to transfer the wound General Shangguan

117
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,470
inflicted on your chest to your back.

118
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,870
Moreover,

119
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,710
you have even more unexpected trump cards.

120
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,730
Apply the medicine first.

121
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,350
Yes.

122
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,990
Did Queen Yan invite me here?

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
Indeed, it was Queen Yan's order.

124
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,990
Since you're childhood sweethearts,

125
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,400
I wish you a lifetime of happiness together.

126
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,430
May you two be together in the end.

127
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,400
Stop bringing harm to others.

128
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,490
I knew you cared about me.

129
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,710
You specially hosted a banquet

130
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,710
to welcome me back.

131
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,630
[Heavenly Match]

132
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,090
What a nice name.

133
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,090
You're so thoughtful.

134
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,960
I knew there was another reason behind your marriage to Shangguan Weiyang.

135
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,380
Ye Beichen.

136
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,440
Mind your manners. Get out!

137
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,220
You personally brewed this wine.

138
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,060
Why not have a taste together?

139
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,270
This wine is prepared for you and Huan Yan.

140
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,360
May you two be together in the end.

141
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,400
What does it have to do with me?

142
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,560
Such a trivial trick.

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,040
Do you think you can escape from my hand?

144
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,090
Aren't you being too naive?

145
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,200
Ye Beichen,

146
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,780
don't even dream of keeping me trapped.

147
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,320
A bird trying to escape its cage?

148
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,130
Do you know the consequences?

149
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,910
At worst, we'll perish together.

150
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,330
A fight to the bitter end!

151
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,710
I'd like to see what skills you possess.

152
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,350
Your Highness,

153
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,070
Queen Yan said she hasn't officially married you yet,

154
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,530
and insists on moving to the side chamber.

155
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,250
It's a waste of the Weiyang window lattice

156
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,620

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,690
Why not let her

187
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,930
♫Memories linger, refusing to fade quietly♫

188
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,620
know of your kind intentions?

189
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,560
No need.

190
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,020
Ye Mingxuan has placed spies in the mansion;

191
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,700
♫Time flies, and the love, hate, joy, sorrow♫

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,540
♫Partings and reunions come alive on the page♫

193
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,700
we must not let them see through my intentions,

194
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,880
♫A wish from the past life, fulfilled in this life♫

195
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,940
or else it will put Weiyang in danger.

196
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,670
♫The world is eternal, and longing lasts long♫

197
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,140
You exposed the true nature of the Fifth Prince

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,610
♫Turn that unwillingness into meaning♫

199
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,090
for Queen Yan,

200
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,320
but she has always misunderstood and thought that

201
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,960
♫Turn regret into sorrow♫

202
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,960
you were opposing her.

203
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,900
♫Time slowly tells the stories of the past♫

204
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,630
It's better that she misunderstands.

205
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,770
Let her continue to misunderstand.

206
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,860
Announce King Feng Xuanyi of Xuannan to see the Emperor.

207
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,720
[Taiji Palace]

208
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,980
[King Xuannan, Feng Xuanyi]

209
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,590
I, Feng Xuanyi, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

210
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,920
Your Majesty,

211
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,500
what's contained in this box

212
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,350
is the unique "Immortal Nectar" from Yunnan.

213
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,700
It is renowned for its life-prolonging properties

214
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,430
and effectiveness in curing hundreds of poisons,

215
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,320
rivaling the Northern Ginseng King.

216
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,240
I've heard Immortal Nectar is obtained from bees.

217
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,580
How does it differ from honey then?

218
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,520
Honey is made from nectar,

219
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,870
while Immortal Nectar is formed

220
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,850
when countless bees offer their own flesh and blood

221
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
to serve the queen bee.

222
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,150
It can be said to be the essence of heaven, earth, sun, and moon,

223
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,320
unique to Yunnan.

224
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,110
I've heard that within a bee colony,

225
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,560
there is only one queen bee.

226
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
Why not present the bee queen as tribute,

227
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,360
so that the Immortal Nectar can be harvested endlessly

228
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,400
to supply His Majesty with daily use?

229
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,840
You only know one thing

230
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,940
and not the other.

231
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,270
The bee colony can only gather nectar

232
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,340
and offer it to the queen in places that are suitable.

233
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,070
Yunnan is the ideal place

234
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,060
for the bee colony to build its nest and establish a queen.

235
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,630
The Feng family, having only been in Yunnan for a few years,

236
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,260
dares to scheme?

237
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,420
If the Feng family no longer wishes to continue,

238
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,680
we Yan family

239
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,510
will escort a new King Xuannan to take over at any time.

240
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,130
The Feng family's loyalty to Your Majesty is evident for all to see.

241
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,210
We swear to guard Yunnan for Your Majesty with our lives.

242
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,030
I accept your Immortal Nectar.

243
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:30,800
Please be seated.

244
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,270
Long live Your Majesty!

245
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,960
Our Great Ye enjoys peace and prosperity,

246
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,730
and the hearts of the people are united.

247
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,310
This is cause for celebration.

248
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,770
Today, I have specially arranged a competition of ball games

249
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,850
for the enjoyment of both ruler and subjects.

250
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,580
The generals and commanders leading the troops need not be mentioned;

251
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,920
even the princes will take part,

252
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,440
so that the people of Great Ye may witness

253
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,580
the harmony of the court.

254
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,290
Your Majesty is wise.

255
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,550
Your Majesty,

256
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,680
I wish to represent Shangguan's army

257
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,190
to compete with the princes.

258
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,390
Ye Beichen

259
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,300
slandered you in front of the Emperor,

260
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,840
and now he has even prevented you from participating,

261
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,140
causing you to miss the chance to showcase your skills before the Emperor.

262
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,270
It's alright.

263
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,140
I don't care about that either.

264
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,950
Weiyang,

265
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,930
you know my intentions;

266
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,970
I only want to grow old with you and remain devoted forever.

267
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,350
By the way,

268
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,310
I also intend to join the competition today

269
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,940
to put Ye Beichen in his place.

270
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,300
Good.

271
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,060
Our Great Ye governs

272
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
with equal emphasis on both civil and military affairs.

273
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,250
Today, both men and women may participate.

274
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

275
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,870
Master, everything is ready.

276
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Today, you are to take the field as a player;

277
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,940
be sure to do everything possible to outshine King Yan.

278
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,890
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,870
Weiyang will be on the field today.

280
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,990
Remember,

281
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,300
do not harm her.

282
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,060
Yes.

283
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,150
This competition is held in teams of five,

284
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,850
with groups determined by drawing lots.

285
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,990
Each team has one incense stick's time limit.

286
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,260
The team with the most points wins,

287
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,750
and the player with the highest number of goals scored

288
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,010
is deemed the best on the field today.

289
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,910
The Emperor will bestow a reward.

290
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,670
Shangguan Weiyang has scored a point.

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,800

Today's competition on the field

332
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,859
showcased everyone's skills and talents,

333
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,349
demonstrating the bravery and valor of our Great Ye.

334
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,480
Though no victor was decided,

335
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,339
in terms of strategy and courage,

336
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,780
Weiyang stood out in every way.

337
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,150
I hereby reward you with a Dragon Emblem token.

338
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,230
With this token, you may enter and leave the palace freely,

339
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,040
as if carrying my imperial decree.

340
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,920
No one shall hinder you.

341
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,849
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,609
Rise.

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

344
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,150
Where's Mingxuan?

345
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,100
Your Highness, as long as you give the order,

346
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,130
I will certainly follow your lead.

347
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,090
So, they have been colluding all along.

348
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,100
Ye Beichen's repeated intimidation of Feng Xuanyi

349
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,410
before the Emperor earlier

350
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,490
was clearly a deliberate act,

351
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,630
a planned performance to work together.

352
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,160
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.
