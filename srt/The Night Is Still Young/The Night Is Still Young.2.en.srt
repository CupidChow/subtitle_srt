00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,290
Why would the Emperor arrange a marriage between King Yan and me?

His Highness, King Yan, has arrived!

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,550
What?

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,069
Miss Shangguan, do you want to defy the imperial decree?

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,690
Your Highness, what is the meaning of this?

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,810
General Shangguan,

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,800
His Highness has personally come to

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,710

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,130
Isn't it rather hasty

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,890
to deliver the betrothal gifts today?

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,810
Why did His Majesty suddenly arrange a marriage between you and me?

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,430
Are you behind this?

30
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,759
Brother,

31
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,530
the Fifth Prince was originally in charge of the fireworks display.

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,210
Now that there has been an incident with the fireworks,

33
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,140
he still managed to protect you flawlessly.

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,870
Don't you find it suspicious?

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,080
Now, you've put him in charge of investigating this case.

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,050
Aren't you afraid he might be the thief crying, "Stop thief!"?

37
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:57,090
Mingxuan is frequently involved in romantic affairs

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,009
and lacks great ambitions.

39
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,910
General Shangguan commands powerful troops.

40
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,900
If you were to grant him a reward,

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,580
he would seize the opportunity to ask for Shangguan Weiyang's hand in marriage.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,070
Moreover,

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
he has already gained

44
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,490
the reputation of meritorious service in protecting you.

45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,820
If he were to gain the support of the Shangguan's army,

46
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,690
who can say that the court's power wouldn't shift in his favor?

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,140

the allure of becoming Crown Prince

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,390
can drive people to any lengths.

50
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,430
It seems now

51
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,220
that arranging a marriage between Mingxuan and Shangguan Weiyang

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,700
is not the best strategy either.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
I have a solution

54
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,140
that can solve your troubles, Brother.

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,020
Let's hear it.

Let Shangguan Weiyang be my bride.

You know that we are in love,

60
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,710
yet you insist on breaking us apart.

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,280
Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed by the world?

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,550
I always get.

The truth about the fireworks case

65
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,100
will eventually come to light.

His Majesty has already ordered me to investigate this case.

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,050
In the last life,

70
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,040
he used this case

71
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,810
to frame my father and have him imprisoned through Vice General Wang.

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,560
Now, he wants to harm my father

73
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,020
and force me into marriage—

74
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,750

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,230
Do you also intend to fight for the throne?

81

The military tally?

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,960
The late Emperor himself bestowed this upon me.

83
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,950
It allows me to command the armies of the country.

84
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,960
If I, Ye Beichen, harbored treasonous ambitions,

85
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,680
I would have acted on them long ago.

since you want to marry my daughter,

93
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,410
there must be a formal exchange of birth details

94
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,590
and the giving of bridal gifts.

95
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,370

Even at a time like this,

you still remember that I like chestnut cakes.

115
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,460

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,990
You're a suspect now.

187
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,330
Escaping would only add to your crimes.

188
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,710
If you want to find a reason to blame, there's always one to be found.

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,090
Mingxuan and I are clearly innocent.

190
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,060
I don't want to hear

191
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,030
the name "Mingxuan" come from your lips again.

192
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,360
Whose name I call

193
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,630
is none of your business.

194
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,980
Your Highness!

195
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,750
Your Highness.

196
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,630
From now on,

197
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,570
you are the Queen Yan.

198
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,840
You'll have nothing to do with Ye Mingxuan anymore.

199
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,710
News from the palace:

200
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,030
After His Majesty learned

201
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,830
that the Fifth Prince had something to do with Vice General Wang's death,

202
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,020
his condition worsened due to anger,

203
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,730
leaving him bedridden.

204
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,620
What are His Majesty's symptoms?

205
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,920
They say His Majesty has difficulty breathing, along with purple lips,

206
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,900
weakness, and occasional confusion.

207
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,520
I remember once...

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,570
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

209
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,710
Your Majesty.

210
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,050
Your Majesty, you've been poisoned with Gu worms!

211
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,190
Your Majesty.

212
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,450
I have found important clues.

213
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,230
The King Yan has been secretly raising Gu worms.

214
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,500
It appears

215
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,100
King Yan is behind this.

216
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,400
Now that we have the imperial decree of marriage,

217
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,960
even if I escape from his mansion, it's useless.

218
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,960
If I can get hold of the Gu worms he's raising,

219
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,360
it'll be enough to prove that he has the intention to rebel.

220
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,250
Then, I can completely annul the engagement.

221
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,070
I can't believe

222
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,420
he has such a place in the back mountain.

You'd better forget

234
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,630
everything you saw in the cave today.

235
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,640
Ye Beichen, don't be so smug.

236
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
Sooner or later, you'll fall into my hands.

237
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,330
Very well.

238
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,090
I'll wait for the day I die by your hand.

239
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,150
Let go of me!

240
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,230
-Let go of me!
-Don’t move.

241
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,750
I've got the Gu worms now.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,980
Ye Beichen,

243
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,490
let's see how you can harm the Emperor now.

244
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,370
[King Yan's Mansion]

245
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,770
King Yan, please come out and talk!

246
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,820
Father-in-law, you visit late at night.

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,010
What brings you here?

248
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,740
Your Highness, I don't dare

249
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,440
to be called "father-in-law" by you.

250
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,490
My daughter hasn't officially married you yet.

251
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,540
It's inappropriate for her to stay in your mansion for long.

252
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,690
Your Highness, please

253
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,700
allow me to take my daughter back to our home.

254
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,910
Wang Ming, the suspect in the fireworks case, has been killed.

255
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,000
Shangguan Weiyang's suspicion hasn't been cleared.

256
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,350
If she doesn't want to be questioned in my mansion,

257
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,950
then she will have to face trial at the Court of Judicial Review.

258
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,040
If that's the case,

259
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,370
then I will wait here.

260
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,950
When Weiyang's name is cleared,

261
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,960
I'll take her back as soon as that happens.

262
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,640
Father!

263
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,190
Weiyang?

264
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,410
My dear daughter.

265
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:02,980
Father.

266
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,190
My conscience is clear, so I have nothing to fear from these accusations.

267
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,870
Weiyang,

268
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,350
don't be afraid.

269
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,860
If you don't want to stay in King Yan's mansion,

270
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,990
I'll risk my life

271
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,380
to get you out of here.

272
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,050
Father.

273
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,740
Please return home for now.

274
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,150
I believe

275
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,710
the truth

276
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,590
will come to light soon.

277
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,310
Okay.

278
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,720
My good daughter,

279
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,120
I'll do as you say.

280
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,540
I'll go back now.

281
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,730
Take good care of yourself.

282
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,740
Don't worry, Father.

283
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,230
Father,

284
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,530
this is evidence of Ye Beichen's plot to harm His Majesty.

285
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,250
He is full of cunning schemes.

286
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,270
We must be wary of him intercepting it.

287
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,870
In my opinion,

288
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,630
it's best to make a feint to the east and attack in the west.

289
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,520
How did you get in here?

290
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,430
This is my room.

291
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,940
What's wrong with me being here?

292
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,670
We're not married yet.

293
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,250
How can we share a room?

294
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,520
Blood?

295
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,190
I've received news

296
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,440
that General Shangguan was ambushed and nearly killed.

297
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,700
How could my father have been attacked?

298
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,850
That's what happens when someone possesses something valuable.

299
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,450
It was you.

300
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,610
You knew that I gave the Gu worms to my father.

301
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,090
He was going to see the Emperor tonight

302
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
to submit evidence of your plot against His Majesty.

303
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,960
So, you wanted to silence him.

304
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,710
