[Episode 14]

3
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,380
I survived.

4
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,610
You should fulfill your promise now.

5
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,830
I truly didn't misjudge you.

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,300
Refine blood with poison and feed the gu with blood.

7
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,930
perhaps

8
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,350
you can really contain the King of Gu.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,050
What should we do next?

10
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,970
This is the result of my countless efforts,

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,440
the most extraordinary poison in the world,

12
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,920
the king of all Gu,

13
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,330
the Life and Death Gu.

14
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,729
You use the Death Gu,

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,110
and she uses the Life Gu.

16
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,590
As long as you both serve as vessels,

17
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,300
the Death Gu can drive the Life Gu

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,150
and bring the dead back to life.

19
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,620
One life, one death.

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,280
I wonder what choices

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,100
you will make in the next life.

22
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,670
Lanterns year after year,

23
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,870
favorable weather for all of us.

Today is the Lantern Festival

25
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,240

How is it possible?

How could this be?

The arrowhead with a Weiyang flower.

42
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:41,710
Why?

43
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,350
Even if I wanted to kill you,

44
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,820
you still saved me. Why?

45
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,790
Why?

46
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,310
Why do you do so much for me?

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,659
Your Highness.

48
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,980
Your Highness.

49
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,670
Weiyang,

50
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,670
in the end, you still

51
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,909
chose to leave.

52
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,610
Your Highness.

53
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,960
Your Highness, a message from the palace states

54
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,990
that His Majesty has learned about General Shangguan's matter.

55
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,230
I'm afraid His Majesty will soon send someone

56
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,270
to summon you to the palace for questioning.

57
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,070
Have you seen the Queen?

58
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,710
I have not seen her, Your Highness.

59
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,950
Your Highness.

60
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,590
You should first appease the palace envoy.

61
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,830
Try to buy as much time as possible.

62
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,100
I'll deal with it after I find Weiyang.

63
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,250
Your Highness, this matter is urgent.

64
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,110
If not handled properly, I'm afraid it might...

65
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,700
Go.

66
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,430
Yes, Your Highness.

67
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,800
Brother Beichen?

68
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,630
Brother Beichen.

69
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,410
You shielded Shangguan Weiyang from the explosion.

70
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,520
How could you not consider your own safety?

71
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,630
This matter doesn't concern you.

72
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,170
How can it not concern me?

73
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,530
Brother Beichen,

74
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,190
you are my only family.

75
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,320
If anything happens to you,

76
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,030
do you know how heartbroken I would be?

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,010
Shangguan Weiyang has caused you to be hurt so many times,

78
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,500
each time worse than the last.

79
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,720
Brother Beichen,

80
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,030
you can't be with her anymore.

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,770
Brother Beichen.

82
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,250
Even if you don't want to hear it now,

83
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,030
I have to say it.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,960
I am the one who can truly help you,

85
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,200
the one who can protect you.

86
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,409
What can you help me with?

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,800
Your situation is delicate now.

88
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,480
You're viewed with suspicion by His Majesty

89
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,850
and isolated by the court officials.

90
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,170
Now, with the Shangguan family incident,

91
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,230
even the common people

92
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,890
have doubts about you.

93
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,650
It can be said you're surrounded by enemies on all sides.

94
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,390
Even if the whole world is against me, so what?

95
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,430
I know, Brother Beichen,

96
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,830
you don't want chaos in the world

97
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,380
or the people to suffer.

98
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,650
I can help you clear your name

99
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,900
and prove your innocence.

100
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,110
Help me?

101
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,350
Yes.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,250
I can do anything for you, Brother Beichen,

103
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,360
as long as you leave Shangguan Weiyang

104
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,750
and be with me from now on.

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,920
Wishful thinking!

106
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,700
Brother Beichen,

107
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,710
why are you so stubborn?

108
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,210
Did Ye Mingxuan really kill my father,

109
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,180
destroy my Shangguan family,

110
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,710
and try to take my life?

111
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,380
Did Ye Beichen really try to save me,

112
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,730
even at the cost of his own life?

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,680
Those things I saw—

114
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,820
were they dreams

115
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,980
or things that really happened?

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,030
Is all of this true or false?

117
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,910
Weiyang,

118
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,590
I know there are many misunderstandings between us.

119
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,940
Disturbing General Shangguan's body

120
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,120
was truly unavoidable.

121
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,750
Because I believe

122
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,020
there must be something suspicious about General Shangguan's death.

123
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,520
I must investigate thoroughly.

124
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,100
Weiyang,

125
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,210
I neglected your feelings.

127
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,040
Please trust me.

128
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,140
Give me some more time,

129
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,500
and I will definitely uncover the truth!

130
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,330
How long?

131
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,360
Seven days, is that alright?

132
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,410
Please, Uncle.

133
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,240
His Majesty requests your presence.

134
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,550
Father,

135
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,910
King Yan, Ye Beichen, disregards the law.

136
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,720
Not only did he kill General Shangguan,

137
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,950
but he also held Weiyang captive.

138
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,630
To destroy evidence,

139
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,560
he even went so far as to desecrate General Shangguan's body.

140
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,950
His ambition is treacherous, his intentions punishable.

141
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,270
I advise

142
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,270
to strip him of his military power and imprison him.

143
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,910
Is what Mingxuan says true?

144
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,430
The reason I disturbed General Shangguan's body

145
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,710
was actually to investigate the case.

146
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,160
Was it really to investigate

147
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,990
or to destroy evidence?

148
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,120
Uncle, you know best in your heart.

149
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,710
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

150
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,960
Speak.

151
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,670
There are indeed many suspicious points about my father's death.

152
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,950
To avoid being exploited by those with ulterior motives,

153
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,150
I, Weiyang,

154
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,630
am willing to give King Yan a chance to uncover the truth.

155
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,260
Weiyang, you...

156
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,230
You may have misunderstood.

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,190
King Yan did not imprison me,

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,880
nor did I personally witness

159
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,870
him killing my father.

160
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,710
But we were all there at the scene.

161
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,980
Before General Shangguan died,

162
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,270
he called out for Ye Beichen.

163
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,870
It's also possible

164
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,950
that my father wanted Ye Beichen

165
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,870
to uncover the truth for him

166
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,270
and clear his name.

167
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,700

[Tomb of Shangguan Ting, General of Loyalty and Valor]

170
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,690
When I was little, my father was busy with military affairs.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,100
I was afraid of the dark,

172
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,790
so every time he went out,

173
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,980
he would prepare a gift

174
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,060
and hide it in a corner of the courtyard.

175

[Tomb of Shangguan Ting, General of Loyalty and Valor]

176
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,370
He told me

177
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,410
that as long as I found it, he would come back.

178
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,500
So, I searched

179
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,050
and searched.

180
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,020
Every time I found it,

181
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,520
Father would always return on time.

182
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,680
He never broke his promise.

183
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,920
But this time,

184
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,210
no matter how many clues Father left,

185
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,280
whether I find the real culprit or not,

186
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,990
he won't be coming back.

187
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,720
Don't worry,

188
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,260
I'll make sure the real culprit pays for this in blood.

189
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,990
I can trust your words for now,

190
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,000
but I also want to search for the real culprit with you.

191
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,360
Alright.

192
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,310
Try this.

193
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,700
Your Highness, please have a taste.

194
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,800
His Highness personally cooked this for you.

195
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,970
You said there's something suspicious about my father's death.

196
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,670
Have you found any clues?

197
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,090
When I first saw General Shangguan

198
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
at the villa,

199
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,710
I suspected

200
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,610
that he was being controlled by something.

201
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,350
So I snuck into the general's mansion

202
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,050
to examine the body.

203
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,250
Sure enough,

204
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,930
I found a Gu worm

205
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,510
in your father's Danzhong acupoint,

206
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,300
but I didn't know what kind it was.

207
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,920
Brother Beichen?

208
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,120
Brother Beichen,

209
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,830
although you didn't agree to my proposal,

210
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
your business is my business.

211
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,910
Look.

212
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,110
[Compendium of All Poisons]

213
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,650
There are rumors that General Shangguan's death was suspicious.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
So, I looked into the Compendium of All Poisons my father left behind.

215
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,270
It seems it might be of some use to you.

216
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,470
You can take a look at it.

217
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,430
Brother Beichen,

218
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,190
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,040
I just wanted to introduce it to you.

220
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,270
I'll go back and study the Compendium of All Poisons first.

221
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,420
Change your clothes later

222
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
and come find me.

223
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:48,870
Okay.

224
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,870
I appreciate your help with the Compendium of All Poisons.

225
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,010
Brother Beichen.

226
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,200
Take a look at this.

227
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,340
It records many types of Gu worms.

228
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,370
Is there anything similar to the one found in my father's body?

229
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,490
Ghost Gu.

230
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,370
Completely black,

231
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,810
cold-loving and bloodthirsty,

232
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,630
emitting black mist,

233
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,450
able to control a person's nerves

234
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,600
as if they were possessed by a ghost,

235
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,780
making them act against their own will.

236
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,630
I think this is the one.
