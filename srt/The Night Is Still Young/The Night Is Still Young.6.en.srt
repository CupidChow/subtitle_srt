the storax incense you used before

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,570

♫Partings and reunions come alive on the page♫

185
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,850
That time at the court,

186
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,190
it was you who saved me, wasn't it?

187
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,560
♫A wish from the past life, fulfilled in this life♫

188

Why haven't you taken action yet?

195
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,090
As for when to act,

196
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,290
I have my own plans.

197
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,020
I don't need you to order me around.

198
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,650
You should know

199
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,080
the consequences of defying me.

200
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,110
The longer you delay,

201
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,760
the worse it will be for you.

202
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,700
Mark my words.

203
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,960
Your Highness, how about this one?

204
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,920
Where's my hairpin?

205
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,010
Are you looking for this?

206
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,010
Why do you have it?

207
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,280
Are you painting with clear water?

208
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,850
No, I'm just testing the brush.

209
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,140
Do you need anything else?

210
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,300
No, nothing.

211
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,130
Painting with clear water.

212
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,460
When the water dries, won't everything disappear?

213
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,410
He's being deliberately mysterious.

214
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,940
What is he writing?

215
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,530
Colorless and odorless.

216
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,430
But no matter the words,

217
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll make you reveal.

218
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Your Highness.

219
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,580
Your Highness,

220
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,470
I have arranged everything

221
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,750
for the matter you've instructed.

222
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,330
If there is even the slightest movement,

223
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,730
the Eagle Guards will respond immediately.

224
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,750
Very good.

225
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,210
Next, we...

226
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,530
Your Highness.

227
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,870
Brother Beichen?

228
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,820
Brother Beichen.

229
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,340
I've brought you some ginseng tea.

230
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,500
Brother Beichen,

231
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,410
you don't look well.

232
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,650
Your pulse is feeble, and your breathing erratic.

233
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,440
Brother Beichen, you've been poisoned.

234
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,620
Poisoned? How could His Highness have been poisoned?

235
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,750
Who is there?

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,210
It's you.

237
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,040
Sneaking around here like this.

238
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,420
Did you poison him?

239
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,110
Don't make false accusations.

240
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,390
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

241
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,290
What's that in your hand?

242
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,420
This? This is...

243
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,530
I knew it was you.

244
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,860
How dare you.

245
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,120
I simply made a mistake in my cultivation,

246
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,190
which caused a reversal of my qi and blood.

247
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,380
Brother Beichen,

248
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,910
I did all of this for you.

249
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,200
But why do you always protect this woman?

250
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,310
Because she is my woman.

251
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,790
As for you,

252
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,990
you need to know your place.

253
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,470
Both of you, leave!

254
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,820
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,400
