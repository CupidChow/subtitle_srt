00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,420
will you show up or not?

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,260
How did you know I was here?

6
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,690
Does it hurt?

7
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,300
Why do you carry medicated wine with you?

8
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:29,330
Why do you carry medicated wine with you?

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,160
You're alright?

10
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,539
Who told you I was hurt?

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
Ye Beichen,

12
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,370
there are some things I must get to the bottom of today!

13
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,610
All those major things that happened before—

14
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,050
the fireworks explosion,

15
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,229
the Emperor being poisoned with Gu worms,

16
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,390
and searching for the whereabouts of the Qiankun Pearl in the black market—

17
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,070
how is it

18
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,190
that you can accurately predict

19
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,670
the direction and outcome of every single event?

20
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,800
I don't keep my Eagle Guards for nothing.

21
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,030
Even if the Eagle Guards knew I was in the cellar,

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,120
why did you bring medicated wine with you?

23
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,350
Why did you immediately start applying medicine when you came in?

24
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,840
You can't answer that, can you?

25
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,130
Because I accidentally entered the cellar in my previous life

26
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,260
and happened to injure my right ankle.

27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,910
And today, you foresaw all of this.

28
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,760
You've been reborn too,

29
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,430

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,840
You mean,

32
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,760
I died once and then came back to life?

33
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,060
I never thought

34
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,290
you would have such a fantastical imagination.

35
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,180
I've spent years campaigning and fighting in wars.

36
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,220
It's not strange for me to carry some medicated wine, is it?

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,570
I don't believe you.

♫Time slowly tells the stories of the past♫

184
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,720

♫Partings and reunions come alive on the page♫

As long as she is happy.

198
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,890
Weiyang,

199
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,840
what are you looking at?

200
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,810
Nothing.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,710
The past choice I made to step aside and silently protect her

202
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,240
ultimately became a grave mistake that pierced my heart.

203
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,730
This time,

204
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,870
how I wish I could take a step further.

205
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,590
However, heaven has only given me three months.

206
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,830
We can only love each other but not be together.

207
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,750
How could I bear

208
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,410
to make her a widow?

209
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,500
Your Highness,

210
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,860
you're torturing yourself

211
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,810
and the Queen.

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,050
The past concessions and sacrifices

213
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,970
became her calamity.

214
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,390
This time, I must not take another step forward.

215
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,690
But if this continues,

216
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,020
the Queen's misunderstanding of you will only deepen.

217
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,930
If I can only be a passerby in her life,

218
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,330
then the best way to protect her

219
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,470
is to make her hate me.

220
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,610
Where is Huan Yan?

221
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,870
Your Highness, Huan Yan is in prison.

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,490
I've ordered the Eagle Guards to keep a close watch on her.

223
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,620
That person always wears a black robe.

224
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,120
I've never seen his true face,

225
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,870
and he's never revealed his identity to me either.

226
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,990
But I suspect

227
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,520
that the person isn't Huo Dao,

228
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,430
but more like...

229
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,660
Ye Mingxuan.

230
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,420
In your contact with them,

231
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,000
did you obtain any evidence?

232
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,390
He is secretive in his actions.

233
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,610
I have never...

234
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,740
He's been controlling you with the Heartbreak Powder.

235
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,750
It must be very difficult for you, huh?

236
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,620
Brother Beichen, save me.

237
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,200
Save me.

238
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,400
Poisoned wine?

239
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,380
Brother Beichen.

240
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,140
Do you really not care about our past at all?

241
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,340
Drink it.

242
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,700
Drink it.

243
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,040
By the way, Mingxuan,

244
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,290
when you saved me outside the court that day,

245
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,420
did you see anyone else there?

246
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,960
I didn't.

247
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,810
Your Highness,

248
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,300
the King is not good with words.

249
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Even though he saved you,

250
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,270
he never thought of demanding something in return.

251
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,060
As for this Fifth Prince,

252
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,850
he's really good at stealing credit behind people's backs.

253
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,110
But this bracelet was securely on your wrist before.

254
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,400
How did it suddenly disappear?

255
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,970
I can't figure it out either.

256
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,340
A man's words

257
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,670
are the least trustworthy thing in this world.

258
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,730
Do you think the Ye Mingxuan you see now

259
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,150
is his truest self?

260
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,550
Who should I believe?

261
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,410
[Yunhe Pavilion]

262
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,800
Life is but a dream,

263
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,280
and love runs too deep to wake from.

264
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,700
Miss Shangguan, you seem to have something on your mind.

265
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,050
Huan Yan betrayed Ye Beichen by stealing the Qiankun Pearl,

266
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,920
yet Ye Beichen still keeps her in the mansion.

267
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,760
Brother Beichen,

268
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,400
this isn't poisoned wine.

269
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,250
This is Zhen wine

270
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,860
made from the feathers of the Zhen bird.

271
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,910
It's extremely poisonous,

272
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,600
yet it's also the antidote to the Heartbreak Powder.

273
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,960
You're not going to kill me?

274
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,370
Before Master passed away,

275
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,870
he entrusted you to my care.

276
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,560
Today, I spare your life

277
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,170
as a repayment for his kindness in teaching me.

278
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,490
If you dare cause trouble again in the future,

279
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,120
don't blame me for being merciless.

280
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,780
However, the piece you just played

281
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,950
was really inappropriate.

282
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,270
Brother Beichen has just recovered the Qiankun Pearl

283
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,970
and has received praise from the Emperor.

284
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,220
Shouldn't you play a celebratory tune

285
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,640
to mark the occasion?

286
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,900
I wish to play the zither,

287
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,260
but alas, there are no kindred spirits to appreciate it.

288
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,690
I'm not a court musician.

289
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,700
Why should I play for you two?

290
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,720
Brother Beichen,

291
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,910
did you keep me here

292
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,640
to keep an eye on Ye Mingxuan,

293
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,880
or to help you keep Shangguan Weiyang at bay?

294
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,110
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

295
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,600
Stay in the side courtyard,

296
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,830
and without my orders,

297
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,300
don't stir up trouble.
