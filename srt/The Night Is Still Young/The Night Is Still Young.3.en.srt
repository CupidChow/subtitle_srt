186
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,530
if you don't want me to lock you up for life,

187
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,640
♫The song is not over, making a promise to grow old together♫

188
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,600
then be obedient.

189
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,210
Otherwise...

190
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,750
Your Highness!

191
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,510
Your Highness.

192
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,850
A decree from the palace:

193
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,440
His Majesty summons you and the Princess to the palace immediately.

194
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,539
You don't need to worry too much.

195
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,669
Although I'm injured,

196
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,309
I've already secretly arranged people

197
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,060
according to your plan

198
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,620
to deliver the real Gu worm

199
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,410
into the palace.

200
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,600
Now we can only hope that the Gu worm

201
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,570
can be safely delivered to His Majesty.

202
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,830
In that case,

203
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,950
Ye Beichen's ambitions to rebel

204
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,450
will no longer be hidden.

205
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,530
You mean

206
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,830
King Yan secretly bred the Gu worm,

207
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,550
intending to harm me?

208
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,150
Your Majesty,

209
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,430
I've seen it with my own eyes.

210
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,130
King Yan,

211
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,810
is what Weiyang said true?

212
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,530
I did feed the Gu worm with my own blood,

213
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,130
but this Gu worm is not a poison.

214
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,880
It;s actually a remedy.

215
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,610
Your Majesty,

216
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,340
do not listen to his nonsense.

217
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,150
Your Majesty,

218
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,920
if you grind this Gu worm into powder,

219
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,480
you will understand.

220
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,550
These days,

221
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,040
I have never felt such relief in my chest.

222
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,150
The young Gu worm is poison,

223
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,380
but the mature one is medicine.

224
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,610
That's why I used my own blood to feed the Gu worm,

225
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,050
to make it mature early

226
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,490
and become a remedy for all ailments.

227
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,570
So,

228
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,230
King Yan shed his own blood to mature the Gu worm

229
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,960
in order to cure Your Majesty.

230
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,980
His loyalty to Your Majesty is truly unwavering.

231
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,030
King Yan is meritorious.

232
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,790
Reward him with ten thousand taels of gold.

233
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,300
Your Majesty,

234
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,410
I only request to advance my wedding day

235
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,920
to a month later.

236
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,200
Recently, there have been several incidents in the palace,

237
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,630
and my health is not as good as before.

238
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,750
Your wedding will be a good occasion to bring some joy.

239
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,580
I approve.

240
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

241
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,320
Why, no matter how hard I try,

242
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,040
can I never escape

243
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,550
the fate that entangles me with Ye Beichen,

244
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,020
and it becomes even more intertwined than before?

245
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,030
Your Highness, there's an assassin!

246
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,500
Mingxuan,

247
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,800
why did you come out?

248
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,070
Without His Majesty's decree,

249
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,070
what if others frame you for escaping the crime?

250
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,690
I don't care about all that.

251
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,950
Anyway,

252
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,430
I will never let go of your hand

253
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,700
and let you marry Uncle.

254
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,890
Mingxuan!

255
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,030
Whoever dares to take her from me

256
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,290
will meet their death.

257
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,090
Ye Beichen,

258
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,790
this is all because of me.

259
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,830
It has nothing to do with him.

260
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,180
Come at me instead.

261
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,720
Let him go.

262
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,540
You're that desperate to save him?

263
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,750
You're the one who is ruthless and cruel,

264
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,050
repeatedly hurting him.

265
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,410
Yes,

266
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,030
I am ruthless and cruel.

267
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,790
He hurt me a little today,

268
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,690
and I will return it tenfold.

269
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,950
I want you to take his heart blood.

270
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,190
Weiyang.

271
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,170
If this is stabbed into the heart,

272
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,470
can he still survive?

273
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,780
Do you think he still has a chance to live after

274
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,290
attempting to assassinate me?

275
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,670
I give you two choices.

276
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:31,780
One,

277
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,410
take his heart blood for me.

278
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,150
Two,

279
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,720
I will send him to the Bureau of Punishment

280
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,680
and sentence him to death.

281
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,910
Choose for yourself.

282
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,490
Your Highness.

283
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,620
Shangguan Weiyang.

284
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,940
You made me do this.

285
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,890
Ye Beichen.

286
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,210
Weiyang.

287
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,640
Let go of me!

288
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,150
Weiyang!

289
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,230
Put me down!

290
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,830
Weiyang!

291
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,780
Let me go!

292
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,530
Weiyang!

293
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,710
What do you want?

294
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,820
♫Lend me a moment of joy, with dreams of fantasy♫

295
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,090
How dare you hurt me for another man!

296
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,590
You forced me to marry you first,

297
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,740
and then forced me to shoot the man I love most.

298
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,800
♫Lend me half the warmth, to heal a lifetime♫

299
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,240
Why can't I hurt you?

300
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,510
You love him that much?

301
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,230
Yes!

302
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,490
I love him!

is a thousand times better than you!

307

Even if I could choose again,

308

I'd still choose to hurt you!

♫Refusing to budge an inch♫

310
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,700
Fine.

311
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,150
Since you're so obsessed with him,

312
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,530
♫Hate that we can't meet♫

313
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,710
I will cut off your obsession,

314
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,690
and make you completely mine!

315
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,420

I still cannot change my destiny,

319
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,890
becoming a tool for your power struggle.

320
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,810

I'll have the entire Shangguan clan

330
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,550

Your only way out now

is to marry me.
