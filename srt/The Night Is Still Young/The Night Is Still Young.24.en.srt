[The Night is Still Young]

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,020
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,020
Since ancient times, the will of heaven cannot be defied,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,290
and mysteries cannot be unraveled.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,780
If the Crown Prince wishes to bear the mandate of heaven,

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,620
Shangguan Weiyang must die.

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,950
The Sorcerer King's divine arts are unparalleled in the world;

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,560
there must be a way to break it.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,070
I implore you to break it for me.

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,220
If you wish to keep Miss Shangguan,

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,170
you must send her out of the palace.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,520
Once matters are settled,

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,130
further decisions can be made.

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,880
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,400
It cannot be delayed.

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,570
Otherwise, the situation will become irreparable as time passes,

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,220
and even the gods won't be able to save her.

18
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,380
My lady,

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,470
I thought I would never see you again.

20
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,520
I've long heard that the Sorcerer King harbors ill intent.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,000
Indeed, the Sorcerer King seeks to kill me,

22
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,570
but thanks to Ye Mingxuan's interference,

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,420
he hasn't pressed me too far.

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,720
My lady, as long as you're safe, it'll be fine.

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,350
What does it matter if I live or die?

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,670
But if I truly leave the palace,

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,009
I'll lose any chance to kill Ye Mingxuan.

28
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,370
Luckily, it's not our shift today.

29
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,090
Otherwise,

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,610
we would have been killed along with Lord Li.

31
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,060
Cut the rap. Let's go quickly.

32
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,610
Yue, go and find out

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
what happened.

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,449
Useless!

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,930
There were many guards standing outside the Emperor's chamber.

36
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,760
How could someone like Lord Li, a man over sixty,

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,590
find an opening to bash his head against a pillar?

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,490
Crown Prince,

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,730
a group of senior officials pushed to the palace doors

40
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,850
to see the Emperor.

41
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,480
In the chaos,

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
I failed to

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,240
prevent Lord Li from colliding with the pillar and dying.

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,840
Yangren is ruthless and unrestrained,

45
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,120
with a bloodthirsty nature.

46
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,570
As long as it remains,

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,400
the palace will never be at peace.

48
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,860
You are absolutely right.

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,950
However, Weiyang is to be my future Crown Princess.

50
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,460
If she is sent away because of her ill-fated destiny,

51
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,910
how could I possibly explain it to others?

52
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,340
Bloodshed is already looming.

53
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,329
Why do you still hesitate out of misplaced compassion?

54
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,800
When you ascend to the throne,

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,420
and stand above all,

56
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,660
who will you need to explain yourself to?

57
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,310
I understand.

58
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,840
But I still need to make some preparations.

59
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,820
Give me three days,

60
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,160
and I will definitely make it.

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,660
Weiyang,

62
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,750
these are all things I've had someone carefully prepare.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,050
During your days outside the palace,

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,100
I won't let you suffer any grievances.

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,710
Although I am inauspicious,

66
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,630
at least I have the General's Mansion to return to.

67
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,520
You don't need to worry about these matters.

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,470
Weiyang,

69
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,180
I'm sending you out of the palace

70
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,770
for your own good.

71
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,030
If someone like Lord Li appears,

72
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
won't everyone once again shift the blame

73
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,290
onto you?

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,030
Honestly, as long as it's for your good,

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,360
leaving the palace is nothing

76
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,829
worth mentioning.

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,810
I've just been wondering;

78
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,770
does Ji Wuming truly have your best interests at heart,

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,050
or does he have ulterior motives?

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,170
Sorcerer King, but with Lord Li's death outside the Emperor's chamber,

81
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,220
I wonder if

82
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,220
there is any way for me to ease this matter.

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,810
You need to make the sacrifice to the heavens

84
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,770
to show sincerity.

85
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,610
Weiyang,

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,330
I have ordered everything to be prepared.

87
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,500
Once it's done,

88
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,460
I will bring you back to the palace to take up the Phoenix Seal.

89
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,800
As for whether Ji Wuming is truly loyal to me,

90
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,680
we'll know in the next few days.

91
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,650
Crown Prince, please make the sacrifice to the heavens.

92
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,000
Assassins! Protect the Crown Prince!

93
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,350
Crown Prince!

94
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,150
What are you standing there for? Catch the assassins!

95
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,050
-Yes!
-Yes!

96
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,840
Hurry!

97
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,230
Check over there!

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,760
What about here? Have you searched?

99
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,300
They ran that way!

100
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,350
My lady is the future Crown Princess.

101
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,270
[Grace and Talent]

102
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,900
Why should we report her whereabouts to you?

103
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,590
We are following the Crown Prince's orders to search everywhere.

104
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,950
Anyone not in their rooms is suspicious.

105
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,590
Are you implying that I am suspicious too?

106
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,370
My lady, you were just bathing,

107
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
and yet these people insisted on searching the room.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,430
What happened?

109
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,400
Miss Shangguan,

110
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,520
we are following the Crown Prince's orders to search everywhere.

111
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,250
We apologize for any disturbance and ask for your forgiveness.

112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,180
We will search elsewhere now.

113
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,130
Let's go.

114
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,760
[Grace and Talent]

115
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,590
My lady.

116
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,840
They're gone.

117
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,280
Search over there!

118
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,120
-Yes!
-Yes!

It must be him.

141
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,760
Only he

142
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,630
would save me.

143
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,850
His Highness?

144
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,790
But how could His Highness say that you're inauspicious,

145
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,570
and insist on putting you to death?

160
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,590
This tea is made from tea leaves

161
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,310
that were taken as tribute from the Sorcerer King's homeland.

162
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,010
It's different from ordinary tea.

163
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,030
It's meant to comfort

164
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,310
the Sorcerer King's homesickness

165
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,190
and also serve as a small token of gratitude

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,100
for finding the root of my illness.

167
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,440
Miss Shangguan.

169
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,710
Sorcerer King.

170
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,610
What happened?

171
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,530
It's nothing.

172
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,710
I just accidentally knocked over the teacup.

173
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,540
Miss Shangguan's illness has been diagnosed.

174
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,990
The prescription will be sent by the maid.

175
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,030
Farewell.

176
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,430
My lady.

177
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,210
Yue!

178
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,770
My lady.

179
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,920
I have led people to carefully check.

180
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,250
His Highness' tomb is intact

181
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,590
and shows no signs of being disturbed.

182
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,770
He is truly dead.

183
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,020
Today I checked his chest.

There were no signs of injury.

I caused his death.

You go back first.

192
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,340

do you not fear losing face for the royal family

200
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,100
