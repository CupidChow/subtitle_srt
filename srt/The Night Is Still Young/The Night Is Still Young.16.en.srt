15

16

It's too sinister.

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,640
What kind of poison is it exactly?

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,580
Is there an antidote?

19
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,870
This is an extremely cold and sinister poison,

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,030
incurable by medicine.

Tell me!

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,300
I once read in an ancient text about a secret technique

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,610
for transferring poison.

29
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,340
The transferrer must first channel internal energy

30
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,270
to open the victim's acupoints,

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,430
then use his power to reverse the victim's blood flow

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,250
and draw out the poison

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,000
into his own body.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,960
However, any misstep

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,310
could cause the transferrer to lose control,

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,040
leading to crippling injuries at best

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,880
