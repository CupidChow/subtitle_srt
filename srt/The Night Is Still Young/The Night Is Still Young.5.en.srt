-Your Highness.

00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,840
Weiyang!

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,870
Weiyang.

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:36,310
Weiyang.

7
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,140
Mingxuan.

8
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,380
Come on.

9
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,350
Where are we?

10
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,700
We're at the fabric shop.

11
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,810
Weiyang.

12
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,660
Fortunately, I arrived in time.

13
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,630
Mysterious assassins suddenly appeared on the court.

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,950
General Shangguan has already escorted His Majesty back to the palace.

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,400
I've already informed him.

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,180
I'll take you back once you wake up.

17
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,930
Thank you, Mingxuan.

18
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,080
There's no need for thanks between us.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,910
Weiyang.

20
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,100
What exactly happened just now?

21
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,390
I'm afraid King Feng Xuanyi of Xuannan has an ulterior motive

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
for visiting the capital.

23
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,590
What do you mean by that?

24
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,790
King Xuannan has never given up his treacherous ambition to establish his own empire.

25
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,820
On the surface, he comes to our court to pay tribute,

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,030
but in reality, he's secretly trying to collude with royal relatives

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,410
to disrupt the court order!

28
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,410
Then in your opinion, Father,

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,190
who is most likely to be King Xuannan's ally?

30
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,800
[Base of Yan's Army]

31
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,640
My father once said,

32
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,180
King Feng Xuanyi of Xuannan may have treasonous intentions,

33
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,500
aiming to crown himself emperor.

34
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,050
This time, I caught him conspiring with Ye Beichen.

35
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,260
That's why

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,310
someone tried to kill me.

37
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,940
Did you hear the content of their conspiracy?

38
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,510
My uncle has always been deep and cunning,

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
and he controls a powerful army.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,420
He'll stop at nothing to seize the throne.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,460
His ambition is clear as day.

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,570
If he joins forces with King Xuannan,

43
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,130
wouldn't the Great Ye be in danger?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
So the most urgent task now

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,250
is to find evidence of his collusion with King Xuannan.

46
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,670
It's already fortunate that you weren't hurt.

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,200
How can you investigate this matter further?

48
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,520
Alright, I understand.

49
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll be careful.

50

51
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,030
My Queen, you seem to be in good spirits.

52
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,550
It's rare to see you in such a disheveled state.

53
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
It's because His Highness was looking for y…

54
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,140
What?

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
Seeing me safe and sound,

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,490

Your Highness,

161
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,260
the long sword tassel is suitable.

162
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,310
But I think this one is better.

163
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,070
His Highness prefers long swords.

164
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,900
This long sword tassel would be perfect.

165
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,520
What Ye Beichen likes

166
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,300
is none of my concern.

168
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,710
Aren't you giving it to His Highness?

169
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,020
Then, who are you giving it to?

170
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,930
Mingxuan saved me outside the court that day.

171
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,540
Naturally, I should repay him in some way.

172
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,340
Wait, wait.

173
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,950
Your Highness, you said the Fifth Prince saved you?

174
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:26,990
That…

175
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,870
That is ridiculous.

176
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,810
That day, unknown assassins appeared at the court.

177

Worried about your safety,

178
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,780
His Highness ordered us to follow General Shangguan to kill the assassins,

179
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,520
while he went alone to look for you.

180

Thinking about it now,

184
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,990
the Fifth Prince must have arrived at some point

185
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,300
and taken you away.

186
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,150
His Highness is unaware of the situation,

187
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,680
so he searched everywhere for you

188
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,910
until he received news

189
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,030
that you had returned safely to the palace; only then did he feel relieved.

190
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,730
Your Highness,

191
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,040
His Highness is not good with words.

192
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,330
Even though he saved you,

193
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,400
he never thought of using it to gain favor.

194
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,460
As for this Fifth Prince,

195
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,490
he's really good at stealing credit behind people's backs.

196
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,550
It was Ye Beichen who saved me.

197
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,990
The Fifth Prince deceived you.

198
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,110
That can't be.

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,360
Is it that the Fifth Prince can't be this bad,

200
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,540
or that His Highness can't be this good?

201
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,720
Anyone who dares to harm her

202
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,420
is on a path to death.

203
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,500
Come to think of it,

204
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,540
although Ye Beichen seems unforgivably evil,

205
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,560
he has saved me twice in critical moments.

206
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,280
Did he save me

207
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,110
♫Lend me a moment of joy, with dreams of fantasy♫

208
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,420
just because of my status?

209
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,480
Or…

210
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,660
for some other reason?

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,880
♫Lend me half the warmth, to heal a lifetime♫

212
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,260
♫Lifting a cold lamp, illuminating the city♫

213
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,710
♫Who waits in the fleeting years♫

214
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,890
Burn it.

215
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,270
Your Highness.

216
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,690
♫Refusing to budge an inch♫

217
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,630
These are the phoenix coronet and wedding robe

218
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,590
that the Queen personally selected at the fabric shop that day.

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,420
♫Hate that we can't meet♫

220
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,110
I have seen her wear it once,

221
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,890
and I don't want to see it a second time.

222
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,140
This set of the phoenix coronet and wedding robe

223
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,970
♫Lend me a setting sun, to fall on a lonely city♫

224
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,080
is exactly the same as the one from the previous wedding.

225
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,130
How could Ye Beichen have seen it before?

226
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,260
Could it be…

227
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,960
♫Lend me the silent wind, to accompany me for a while♫

228
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,810
that he is also a reborn person?

229
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
But if we were to make a new set now,

230
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,390
I'm afraid it wouldn't be as magnificent as this set.

231
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,400
♫Frost on my heart, as cold as bone-eating ice♫

232
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,310
When have I ever cared about appearances?

233
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,420
As long as it's not this set, it's fine.

234
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,620
Burn it.

235
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,030
♫Chasing memories of years gone by♫

236
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,900
Yes.

237
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,840
♫Geese pass, leaving only regrets and cries♫

238
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,700
Wait.

239
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,810
♫Our love was a mutual mistake♫

240
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,910
This wedding robe—

241
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,880
♫I sigh half my life, unable to leave the fog♫

242
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,270
when and where did you see me wear it?

243
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,690
You're curious?

244
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,830
Answer me.

245
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,360
♫Lighting another stick of sandalwood♫

246
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
What answer do you expect?

247
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,600
This robe—

248
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,440
♫Burning the bitterness of parting♫

249
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,630
I have never worn it in this life.

250
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,250
♫Looking back, life is but a dream♫

251
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,630
Unless…

252
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,510
♫Leaving only love and hate to return to the dust♫

253
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,700
Unless…

254
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,350
Unless I've seen it in a dream.

255
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,350
♫Our love was a mutual mistake♫

256
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,490
♫I sigh half my life, unable to leave the fog♫

257
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,220
You have appeared in my dream.

258
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,270
Is this answer satisfactory, My Queen?

259
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,390
♫Lighting another stick of sandalwood♫

260
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,820
♫Burning the bitterness of parting♫

261
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,880
♫Looking back, life is but a dream♫

262
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,150
♫Leaving only love and hate to return to the dust♫

263
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,100
My rebirth is already an unsolvable mystery.

264
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,790
How could I think

265
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,620
that he had also been reborn from just a tiny clue?

266
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,240
It's truly far-fetched.

267
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,390
He is hiding right inside.

268
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,560
Brothers, charge in!

269
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,490
Yes. Kill!

270
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,510
Whoever kills King Yan of the Great Ye

271
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,810
will achieve great merit!

272
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,610
There is a wolf!

273
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,700
The wolf has been drawn by the smell of blood!

274
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,590
There's more than one.

275
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,500
Run quickly!

276
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,250
Run!

277
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,210
Run!

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,350
Save me!

279
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,100
Let's go!

280
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,620
Wait here for me for a moment, okay?

281
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,720
♫Who inquires amidst the dim lights♫

282
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,740
♫These stars that fill the sky♫

283
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,630
♫The fate of love and hate, separation and union♫

284
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,560
How are you? Are you alright?

285
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,110
♫Blame the depth of our love♫

286
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,130
♫Meeting you feels like encountering an old friend♫

287
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,450
This is for you.

288
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,320
♫As if in a past life, passing by the door♫

289
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,150
♫The past is hard to keep, attachment leaves no trace♫

290
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,800
♫How can I join you in this life♫

291
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,329
♫If the soul doesn't cross, if the person doesn't return♫

292
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,460
♫Could you lend me the rise and fall of the next life♫

293
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,940
♫If fate protects us♫

294
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,050
♫In the midst of heavy snow♫

295
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,730
♫Eternal love through the ages♫

296
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,920
♫If love does not fail♫

297
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,870
♫In the depths of blooming flowers♫

298
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,240
♫Accompany you to the twilight years♫

299
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,160
♫If one life and one death are our destiny♫

300
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,590
Weiyang,

301
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,700
in the past, I misjudged people

302
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,560
and wrongly pushed you into an abyss.

303
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,990
Whenever I think about it,

304
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,750
I feel immense regret,

305
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,580
as if a thousand arrows are piercing my heart,

306
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,830
the pain penetrating to my very bones.

307
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,350
Now,

308
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,960
even if it costs me my life,

309
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,960
I will protect you and keep you safe from all worries.
