[Episode 20]

3
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,260
Weiyang?

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,090
Why didn't you inform me before coming to the Eastern Palace?

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,390
I apologize for my rudeness.

6
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,770
I will certainly inform you next time.

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,070
Let go of me, Ye Mingxuan!

8
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,539
Your Highness!

9
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,789
It seems that there's no way out of this cave.

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,410
I have ambushed enemies here before.

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,460
I remember there's a hidden river deep in the cave.

12
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,130
We can escape quietly through the water passage.

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,240
You're wise.

14
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,490
Chu Mo.

15
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,460
Let's split up.

16
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,570
I'll stay behind to hold off death warriors.

17
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,530
You take all the Eagle Guards and leave

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,600
to recover the stolen goods and arrest the culprits.

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,240
Yes.

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,060
All Eagle Guards, follow me.

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,979
-Yes!
-Yes!

22
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,440

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,320
How dare you!

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,990

25
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,650
Report!

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,790
Your Highness.

27
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,920
Speak!

28
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,020
Your Highness.

29
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,830
Our plan to ambush Ye Beichen has failed.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,990
How is that possible?

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,100
Originally, King Yan and the Eagle Guards indeed fell into the trap

32
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,230
and were forced into a cave

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,290
under siege by death warriors.

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,090
But unexpectedly,

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,840
King Yan used himself as bait

36
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,550
to divert death warriors' attention.

37
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,579
What about the weapons?

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,680
He used a diversion tactic

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,260
and ordered the Eagle Guards to secretly intercept them.

40
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,190
What about Ye Beichen?

41
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,990
He injured our men

42
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,730
and then escaped.

43
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,700
Get lost!

44
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,150
Useless!

45
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,690
Weiyang.

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,020
Since you're here in the Eastern Palace,

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,610
stay for a few more days.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,329
It's been a long time

49
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,610
since we've spent time together.

50
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,829
Ye Beichen has already seized the weapons,

51
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,840
and now the ledger is also in his hands.

52
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,420
Ye Mingxuan,

53
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,530
let me see how you're going to talk your way out of this.

54
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,270

57
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,150
My lady, I'm here.

58
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,460
This is evidence of Ye Mingxuan secretly stockpiling troops.

59
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,150
Take it and hand it to Ye Beichen yourself.

60
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,040
My lady, what about you?

61
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,520
Right now, only the ledger can protect Ye Beichen.

62
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,130
Hurry and go!

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,720
Okay.

64
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,960
I'd like to see

65
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,470
what matters more in Uncle's heart-

66
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,650
the ledger

67
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,880

74
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,940

Ye Mingxuan!

77
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,510
It seems that you truly matter far more

78
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,840
to Uncle than the ledger.

79
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,950
Ye Beichen, leave quickly.

80
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,270

Uncle, just put your fingerprint on it.

You want to twist the truth?

109

Since you wish to be remembered as a legendary lover,

110
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,060
why bother with trivialities?

Since you're writing a confession,

120

you haven't even knelt down.

Brother Beichen would never tell you, even to his death.

[Happiness]

368
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,520
In this life,

369
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,850
even if it means giving everything I have,

370
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,730
I vow to ensure your peace.

371
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,550
Though enduring countless hardships,

372
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,570
[The Memorial Tablet of Ye Beichen]

373
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,730
I am truly honored to have met you.

374
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,730
Every sight

375
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,210
♫Who inquires amidst the dim lights♫

376
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,150
is a memory.

377
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,870
♫These stars that fill the sky♫

378
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,580
However,

379
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,560
once we part, there will be no reunion.

380
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,780
♫The fate of love and hate, separation and union♫

381
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,630
I hope you find someone truly destined for you,

382
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,130
♫Blame the depth of our love♫

383
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,780
and as the evening glow fades,

384
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,180
♫Meeting you feels like encountering an old friend♫

385
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,620
you will forget me.

386
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,080
♫As if in a past life, passing by the door♫

387
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,920
♫The past is hard to keep, attachment leaves no trace♫

388
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,970
♫How can I join you in this life♫

389
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,590
♫If love does not fail♫

390
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,530
♫I'm willing to wait for loneliness in the next life♫

391
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,940
♫The sea has turned into the wilderness♫

392
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,910
♫I'll walk with you again♫

393
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,120
♫We'll walk all the way to the world♫
