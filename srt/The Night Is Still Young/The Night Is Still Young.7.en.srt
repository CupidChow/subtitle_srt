00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,990
There are rumors

that King Yan runs his household like an army,

00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,890
cold-blooded and ruthless,

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,670
and the King Yan's mansion should be called the King of Hell's mansion.

00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,600
I've never expected this place

No way.

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,470

52
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,090
I'm fine.

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,420
It's all because of you,

This matter has nothing to do with Weiyang.

61
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,020
The assassin was sent by Feng Xuanyi.

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,890

I don't blame you.

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,010
But the poison was definitely her doing, right?

66
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,710

You dare to bring it out again?

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,589
Well?

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,590
Is this lemon poisonous?

73
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,000

Rather than alerting the enemy,

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,110
It can sense the dragon energy of heaven and earth.

187
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,530
Once the dragon vein is disturbed,

188
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,580
it will fly away on its own

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
and choose a new worthy ruler.

190
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,230
If it's really lost,

191
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,510
I'm afraid the world will change its master again.

192
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,240
Your Highness.

193
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,420
You're such a mastermind.

194
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,340
They did make a move on the Qiankun Pearl.

195
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,010
Should I take action immediately?

196
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,960
Drawing without releasing is to catch a big fish.

197
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,420
Now the weight of this big fish is not enough yet.

198
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,130
My lady,

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,450
I don't understand.

200
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,610
How could losing a single pearl

201
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,280
cause such chaos?

202
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,100
Although the Qiankun Pearl

203
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,360
is not as magical as rumored,

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
it represents the royal dignity

205
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,290
and the legitimism of the realm.

206
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,050
Once lost,

207
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,580
it will surely cause panic.

208
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,570
Is it that serious?

209
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,580
More than that,

210
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,630
I think something's going on.

211
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,630
Someone must be deliberately spreading the news

212
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,580
and sowing doubts,

213
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,270
trying to unsettle the people's minds.

214
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,230
Once the people's hearts are unsettled,

215
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,150
the realm will surely fall into chaos.

216
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,170
My dear daughter,

217
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,850
waiting for me here?

218
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,450
Father,

219
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,210
you've been so busy these days.

220
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,770
What exactly has happened?

221
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,680
The Qiankun Pearl is lost,

222
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,750
causing great turmoil in the court.

223
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,640
This must be done by someone with ulterior motives,

224
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,780
paving the way for rebellion.

225
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,760
Has the Qiankun Pearl not been found yet?

226
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,470
We only traced it to the black market,

227
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,370
and then

228
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,270
it disappeared.

229
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,040
Then, in your opinion,

230
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,280
who would dare to

231
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,940
steal the Qiankun Pearl?

232
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,540
I don't know,

233
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,090
but someone saw

234
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,440
King Yan at the Huguo Temple the night before.

235
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,730
King Yan?

236
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,900
Ye Beichen.

237
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,800
The last time

238
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,940
the Qiankun Pearl went missing,

239
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,640
there were rumors it was sold to overseas by the black market master.

240
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,270
But without solid evidence,

241
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,750
Father couldn't take action.

242
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,270
Perhaps the Qiankun Pearl's in the hands of

243
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,660
the black market master now.

244
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,560
As long as we catch him,

245
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,370
we'll surely find out

246
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,520
who has treasonous intentions.

247
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,150
Ye Beichen,

248
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,260
this time I will see

249
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,110
who you really are.

250
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,750
Ye Beichen?

251
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,510
You couldn't have found me so quickly!

252
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,560
Oh no.

253
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,830
Ye Beichen!

254
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,270
You can't kill her!

255
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,450
I'm not going to kill her.

256
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Then let me take her away.

257
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,190
You-

258
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,970
Weiyang.

259
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,410
Are you alright?

260
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,130
I'm fine.

261
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,580
You knew this was a trap.

262
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,810
Why did you follow me?

263
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,390
Then why did you come here

264
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,610
knowing it's dangerous?

265
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,870
I just wanted to see

266
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,680
what your relationship with the black market master really is.

267
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,960
There is no relationship.

268
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,130
Then why did you kill her?

269
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,290
Do you think

270
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,740
I'm here to kill and silence her?

271
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,060
Aren't you?

272
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,750
Do you also think

273
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,190
I stole the Qiankun Pearl as part of the rebellion?

274
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,310
Besides you,

275
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,490
I can't think of anyone else

276
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,510
who would need to do such a thing.

277
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,910
It seems there are too many misunderstandings between us.

278
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,200
If you don't believe me,

279
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,720
you can ask her yourself in a moment.

280
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,050
Let's talk about it after we get out of here.

281
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,460
Weiyang.

282
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,470
It's poisonous smoke.

283
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,080
Weiyang.

284
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,750
How are you?

285
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,220
Will we be trapped and die here?

286
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,090
Don't worry.

287
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm here with you.

288
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,290
I won't let the King of Hell take you.

289
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,930
Ye Beichen.

290
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,380
I've always had a question for you.

291
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,290
That time when my father was escorting the Gu worm into the palace,

292
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,830
he was attacked on the way.

293
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,260
Was it you who saved him?

294
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,020
Your father is an important court official.

295
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,260
Of course I had to save him.

296
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,410
That day when I was attacked at the court,

297
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,150
was it also you who saved me?

298
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,360
You are my princess consort.

299
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,660
Of course I had to protect you.

300
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,750
Why exactly did you do all this?

301
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,560
For the military power of the Shangguan family?

302
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,990
♫Who inquires amidst the dim lights♫

303
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,340

♫These stars that fill the sky♫

305
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,730

♫The fate of love and hate, separation and union♫

307
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,860

♫Blame the depth of our love♫

309
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,800
Weiyang.

310
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,630
This time, the death time is even

311
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
earlier than last time.

312
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,020
♫Meeting you feels like encountering an old friend♫

313
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,790
I can't accept it.

314

♫As if in a past life, passing by the door♫

315
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,690
Weiyang,

316
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,460
I couldn't save you in time in the past life.

317
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,770
♫The past is hard to keep, attachment leaves no trace♫

318
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,540

♫How can I join you in this life♫

320
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,230
Now, even if I have to sacrifice my life,

321
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,890
I won't let history repeat.

322

Thank you for just now.

332

But

333
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,450
your blood can actually detoxify.

334
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,710
I've told you before,

335
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,260
the martial arts I practice are a bit special.

336
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,680
Are we just going to sit here?

337
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,230
Aren't we going to chase after the black market master?

338
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,570
Don't worry.

339
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,530
She'll be here soon.

340
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,720
We can just wait here for her to come to us.

341
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,310
You haven't answered

342
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,630
the question I just asked you.

343
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,859
Find the answer

344
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,359
yourself.

345
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,260
You-

346
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,609
How many faces do you really have?

347
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,190
Why do I feel that

348
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,829
sometimes your actions are extremely contradictory?

349
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,730
People's hearts are like abysses, hard to discern truth from falsehood.

350
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,880
If you insist on delving deeper,

351
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,740
you will lose.

352
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,350
How did you know it was me?

353
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,770
Last time you got away,

354
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,960
this time you won't.

355
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,260
Surrender now.

356
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,580
She's been poisoned by the bungarotoxin.

357
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,990
Once poisoned, there's no cure.

358
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,180
She's dying.

359
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,990
Bungarotoxin?

360
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,750
I remember it's unique to Yunnan.

361
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,600
It's Feng Xuanyi again.

362
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,710
It seems the lesson I taught him last time wasn't enough.
