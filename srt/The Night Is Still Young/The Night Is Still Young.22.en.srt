why are you here with the Crown Prince?

136
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,140
It should have been this way a long time ago.

137
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,710
I've always said

138
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,540
the Crown Prince's feelings for you are sincere.

139
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,690
I'm not sure either.

140
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,510
I can't pretend everything in the past

142
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,360
My lady,

143
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,780
since His Majesty has designated the Fifth Prince as Crown Prince,

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,480
it means he was not responsible

145
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,960
for those misdeeds in the past.

146
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,530
My lady, you should clear up the misunderstanding with the Crown Prince

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
and treat each other sincerely now.

148
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,060
You're right.

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,150
Are you wondering

152
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,290
why I had to bring Weiyang into the Eastern Palace?

153
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,070
Miss Shangguan went to the mass grave without your knowledge.

154
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,830
Her intentions are quite suspicious.

155
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,670
I wanted her to see with her own eyes

156
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,830
that Ye Beichen is dead,

157
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,260
to put an end to any remaining attachment she has to him.

158
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,800
Miss Shangguan once worked with King Yan

159
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,880
and opposed you at every turn.

160
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,540
How loyal she is to you

161
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,750
is really hard to say.

162
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,000
Indeed, a change of heart

163
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,150
indeed doesn't happen overnight.

164
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,200
Moreover,

165
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,400
now that Ye Beichen is dead,

166
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,670
she has no chance to turn back.

167
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,640
She can only start anew.

168
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,030
I just can't understand

169
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,780
how I am inferior to Ye Beichen in any way.

170
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,070
What Ye Beichen could give her,

171
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,830
and even what he couldn't,

172
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,060
I can give her all of it!

173
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,100
Sooner or later, her heart will surely change,

174
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,860
and she will devote herself entirely to me.

175
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,350
Your Highness, you're wise.

176
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,090
My lady,

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,490
you came to the Eastern Palace for the King?

178
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,790
Even now,

179
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,870
I can't bring myself to believe he's dead.

180
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,660
Without him,

181
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,650
everything in this world to me

182
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,790
is nothing but a dream.

183
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,740
But there is one thing

184
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,640
I must do,

185
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,890
and that is to kill Ye Mingxuan with my own hands.

186
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,020
Unfortunately, he's always avoiding me now

187
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,710
and doesn't want to be alone with me.

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,120
Then why does he still let you stay in the palace?

189
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,060
He wants the military power of the Shangguan's army,

190
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,440
but he doesn't trust me.

191
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,290
So he simply sets me aside

192
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,090
to keep me in check for now.

193
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,770
My lady,

194
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,300
he is, after all, the Crown Prince.

195
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,090
The palace is heavily guarded.

196
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,870
Isn't it too dangerous for you

197
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,590
to assassinate him here?

198
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,200
That's why I must get close to him,

199
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,630
earn his trust,

200
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,160
and strike a fatal blow

201
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,130
before complications arise.

202
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,190
Yue,

203
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,700
clear it up first.

204
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,210
Let's go back to the room and discuss this matter further.

205
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,060
Wait.

206
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,210
This is...

207
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,020
Why are there osmanthus cakes?

208
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,760
This was given by the steward of the Eastern Palace.

209
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,390
I heard from the Eastern Palace's cooks

210
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,710
that they make osmanthus cakes for the Crown Prince every day,

211
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,840
but he only takes a few bites

212
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,360
before giving them away to the servants.

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,090
Mingxuan.

214
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,350
Weiyang.

215
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,620
Why are you here?

216
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,030
I've been searching everywhere for you.

217
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,530
My mother...

218
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,130
my mother gave birth to me right here.

219
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,660
Mingxuan,

220
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,980
today is your birthday.

221
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,750
Your mother's spirit in heaven

222
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,590
would surely be happy.

223
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,520
This jade pendant

224
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,140
comes from the quarries of your mother's homeland.

225
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,050
Take a look. Do you like it?

226
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,730
Weiyang, thank you.

227
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,470
Mother.

228
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,770
I just wish I could eat osmanthus cakes one more time.

229
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,990
Heaven is on my side.

230
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,870
Three days from now

231
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,710
will be the anniversary of his mother's death.

232
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,530
Who's there?

233
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,040
Mingxuan.

234
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,160
Weiyang?

235
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,160
Weiyang, why are you here?

236
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,960
This place is too humble.

237
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,340
It's not fitting for you to come.

238
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,000
You were born here.

239
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,490
Why can't I come?

240
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,260
How did you know?

241
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,810
I heard it from the elder maids in the palace.

242
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,420
Mingxuan, I had no idea

243
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,350
you had lost your mother at such a young age.

244
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,600
Why didn't you ever tell me?

245
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,690
Weiyang.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,450
You're dressed so plainly today.

247
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,170
Is it to honor my mother?

248
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,180
I heard that today is the anniversary of her death.

249
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,180
I wanted to come and pay my respects to her

250
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,070
and keep you company.

251
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,610
Weiyang.

252
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,870
That's very thoughtful of you.

253
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,630
Mingxuan.

254
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,690
I made this myself.

255
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,680
Try it.

256
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,930
Weiyang.

257
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,630
I didn't know you could make osmanthus cakes.

258
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,870
I heard that you like it,

259
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,800
so I learned how to make it myself.

260
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,690
My lady,

261
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,320
are you planning to poison the Crown Prince with osmanthus cakes?

262
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,540
I've caught a cold recently,

263
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,210
so I shouldn't eat too many sweets.

264
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,800
How about this?

265
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,090
You eat it first. It would be a shame to let it go to waste.
