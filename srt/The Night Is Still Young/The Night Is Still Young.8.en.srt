[The Night is Still Young]

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,060
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,120
All signs indicate that

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,020
the person behind the black market leader

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,880
is most likely Feng Xuanyi.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,480
Then use her identity to investigate it.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,730
Be extremely careful.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,530
I will support you from the shadows.

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,220
Follow me.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,470
You're actually alive?

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,770
Where's the Qiankun Pearl?

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,010
I nearly lost my life

13
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,270
because of the Qiankun Pearl.

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,690
Your Highness, you can not take any more risks for it.

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,980
Hand over the Qiankun Pearl to me.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,170
I have my own plans.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,210
The imperial court is also investigating this matter.

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,230
Aren't you afraid they might trace it back to you?

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,530
What evidence is there to prove that

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,050
the Qiankun Pearl, which is being investigated by the court,

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,270
is related to me?

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm afraid the matter of the Qiankun Pearl

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,920
is not that simple.

24
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,720
I risked my life to survive

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,950
just to remind you

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,550
to consider

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,340
who could have found me

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,330
so quickly.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,729
The one who attacked me

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,810
is most likely the person behind you.

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,789
He has used the matter of the Qiankun Pearl

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,070
to disrupt the order of the Great Ye.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,930
When the court places blame,

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,990
you may find it hard to explain.

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,030
Are you suggesting that

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,700
someone is using me?

37
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,690
Your Highness, you might as well tell me who this person is

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,210
so I can investigate

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,350
if it's the same person who attacked me.

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,790
I'm afraid that walls have ears.

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,810
Come over, and I'll write it down for you.

42
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,079
It's you?

43
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,310
Your Highness, the distinguished guest has arrived.

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,150
Let him in.

45
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,050
What brings you here?

46
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,100
I've made several,

47
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,020
but none are as beautiful as what the embroiderer made.

48
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,380
But you mustn't dislike it.

49
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,540
I cherish it too much.

50
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,670
How could I dislike it?

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,990
To me,

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,700
it's one of a kind.

53
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,720
Who else in this world,

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,920
apart from me, Ye Mingxuan,

55
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
could receive a bracelet

56
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,350
personally woven by Miss Shangguan?

57
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,070
It's not exactly one of a kind.

58
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,000
Look,

59
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,420
I made one for myself too.

60
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,690
A matching pair.

61
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,680
Flying side by side like birds.

62
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,180
Do you hear the bell's sound? Is it nice?

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,520
Subtle yet clear, crisp but not noisy.

64
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,790
It's beautiful.

65
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,030
I had the best craftsman in the Great Ye

66
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,050
create it by hand.

67
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,190
This bell's sound

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,710
is different from any other bell.

69
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,870
It's unique.

70
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,390
From now on, no matter when,

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,110
I'll never mistake you for someone else,

72
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,440
and you'll never mistake me.

73
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,500
You won't mistake me,

74
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,270
and I won't mistake you either.

75
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,490
Could the person who colluded with Feng Xuanyi

76
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,780
actually be Ye Mingxuan?

77
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,380
My lady,

78
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,340
the Fifth Prince has arrived.

79
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,200
Mingxuan?

80
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,990
Why is he here?

81
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,260
I was just about to go find him.

82
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,570
Weiyang.

83
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,580
Weiyang.

84
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,910
Weiyang.

85
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,040
I've let you down.

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,130
You...

87
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,230
I've been busy looking for the Qiankun Pearl these past few days.

88
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,630
It wasn't until this morning that I realized

89
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,180
I'd lost the bracelet you gave me.

90
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,200
You came to the King Yan's Mansion specifically

91
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,160
just to tell me this?

92
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,070
This is a matter of great importance for me.

93
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,610
In order to see you,

94
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,580
I specifically sought General Shangguan's

95
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,370
permission to deliver the dowry on their behalf

96
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,720
so you wouldn't feel troubled.

97
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,480
You're thoughtful.

98
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,880
But this bracelet was perfectly fine on your wrist;

99
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,210
how could it suddenly go missing?

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,140
I can't figure it out either.

101
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,360
A couple of days ago, I went in disguise to the South Street market.

102
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,470
It was very chaotic there.

103
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,530
Someone even bumped into me.

104
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,200
Now that I think about it,

105
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,170
that person must have been a pickpocket

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,440
who stole my bracelet.

107
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,470
The bracelet was hidden under your sleeve;

108
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,230
how did he even notice it?

109
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,210
If it were about something valuable,

110
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,850
the jade pendant on your waist

111
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,660
is worth far more.

112
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,740
You have a point.

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,760
That person wasn't after money;

114
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,510
he must have had another motive.

115
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,820
But no matter what,

116
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,040
it's my fault, Weiyang.

117
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,470
I failed to keep the bracelet safe.

118
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,650
I deserve to die.

119
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,799
This bracelet could have gone missing at any time,

120
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,809
yet it happened to disappear now,

121
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,030
only to end up in the hands of that man in black.

122
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,950
Could it really be such a coincidence?

123
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,300
Weiyang.

124
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,360
Don't worry.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
I've already sent people to look for it.

126
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,770
I won't rest

127
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,200
until it's found.

128
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,030
The Fifth Prince always chooses moments when I'm not around to show up.

129
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,550
How convenient indeed.

130
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,300
The Yan family is not receiving guests today.

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,160
Fifth Prince, please leave.

132
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,980
Uncle, you've misunderstood.

133
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm here at the request of General Shangguan

134
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,590
to deliver the dowry here.

135
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,710
Mingxuan,

136
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,460
since the items have been delivered,

137
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,760
you should go back and rest early.

138
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,170
Wait.

139
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,170
Fifth Prince,

140
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,190
I allow you to choose one piece of

141
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,390
jewelry that Weiyang likes to accompany her for her wedding,

142
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,970
as a gesture to honor your care for her.

143
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,430
That's not difficult.

144
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,220
But since Uncle has gone to great lengths

145
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,670
to marry Weiyang.

146
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,420
You must care for her deeply.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,560
Why not join me in selecting one?

148
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,170
Let's see whose choice

149
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,310
aligns better with Weiyang's heart.

150
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,370
You want to compete with me?

151
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,230
It's not a competition.

152
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,760
Uncle, are you aware that

153
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,990
snow doesn't fall in the Ye City every winter?

154
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,360
Only when the wind blows in the right direction

155
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,930
and the temperature is cold enough

156
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,630
can one witness the beautiful sight of heavy snowfall.

157
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,620
So what of it?

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,000
Some people, though of noble rank,

159
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,470
may not necessarily summon snowfall

160
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,790
whenever they wish to see it.

161
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,800
If not today,

162
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,520
then I can wait for tomorrow.

163
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,700
If not this year,

164
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,290
then I can wait for next year.

165
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,570
This golden hairpin is exquisitely crafted,

166
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,570
made of the finest materials,

167
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,300
and is perfectly suited for her.

168
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,640
It could be said to be custom-made for you, Weiyang.

169
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,910
Weiyang, do you like it?

170
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,580
Ornate yet impractical.

171
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,960
Expensive but useless.

172
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,710
So Weiyang is

173
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,750
such a woman in your eyes.

174
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,540
I am not a tool for your rivalry.

175
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,450
I'll choose the wedding jewelry

176
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,730
myself.

177
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,150
Weiyang,

178
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,260
The Yan family and the General's family are now united as one.

179
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,560
There's no need for outsiders to interfere in any matters.

180
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,150
I'll take my leave.

181
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,970
Give it back to me.

182
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,340
Give it back to me.

183
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,440
Give it back to me.

184
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,730
♫Who inquires amidst the dim lights♫

185
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,400
♫These stars that fill the sky♫

186
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,690
The owner of that bracelet

187
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,260
has already broken his vow.

188
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,140
♫The fate of love and hate, separation and union♫

189
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,210
What's the use of keeping it?

190
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,730
♫Blame the depth of our love♫

191
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,710
♫Meeting you feels like encountering an old friend♫

192
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,380
He just accidentally lost the bracelet.

193
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,980
It's not entirely his fault.

194
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,610
♫As if in a past life, passing by the door♫

195
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,450
♫The past is hard to keep, attachment leaves no trace♫

196
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,250
The most unreliable thing in this world

197
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,640
is a man's words.

198
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,410
Do you think the Ye Mingxuan you see now

199
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,970
♫How can I join you in this life♫

200
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,090
is really his true self?

201
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,500
I will find out myself

202
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,950
♫If the soul doesn't cross, if the person doesn't return♫

203
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,600
what he truly is.

204
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,510
As for you,

205
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,980
♫Could you lend me the rise and fall of the next life♫

206
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,420
you've clearly found the Qiankun Pearl,

207
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,200
yet you still refuse to present it to the Emperor.

208
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,310
♫If fate protects us♫

209
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,190
What are your true intentions?

210
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,070
♫In the midst of heavy snow♫

211
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,820
True and false, false and true.

212
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,120
♫Eternal love through the ages♫

213
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,170
I hope you can see things more clearly.

214
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,470
♫If love does not fail♫

215
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
Don't try to play tricks on me here.

216
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,270
♫In the depths of blooming flowers♫

217
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,720
A wolf's ambition is like a face behind a mask;

218
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,740
♫Accompany you to the twilight years♫

219
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,860
it can never be hidden forever.

220
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:01,790
♫If one life and one death are our destiny♫

221
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,020
Fine.

222
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,970
Then I'll personally tear off this mask

223
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,970
to let you see more clearly.

224
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,620
Brother Beichen,

225
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,170
I brought you some ginseng tea.

226
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,230
It's late.

227
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,770
You should rest now.

228
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,360
This is the ginseng tea I brewed myself.

229
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,160
You used to like the taste of this ginseng tea.

230
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,890
I've never changed the recipe.

231
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,760
If you have something to say, just say it.

232
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,590
Brother Beichen,

233
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,320
even if you don't speak, I know that

234
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,870
marrying Shangguan Weiyang

235
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,910
is not truly what you desire.

236
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,210
Then what do you think

237
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,510
is my true desire?

238
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,180
In this world, only I truly understand your thoughts.

239
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,120
Only I can help you achieve your desires.

240
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,560
However,

241
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,230
when you ascend to the throne,

242
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,990
I also wish to enjoy the riches and honor of being the Empress of the Six Palaces.

243
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
I wonder if Brother Beichen would agree?

244
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,820
Don't ever mention such treasonous words again.

245
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,390
Otherwise,

246
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,820
I won't consider my mentor's kindness anymore.

247
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,300
Why aren't you continuing your little performance in your room?

248
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,330
Without your present,

249
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,410
there's no point in continuing the performance.

250
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,320
Your so-called performance

251
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,250
is merely you being affectionate with Huan Yan?

252
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,700
Are you angry?

253
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,700
I don't care about your relationship with Huan Yan.

254
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,590
Just don't involve me next time.

255
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,650
Don't be so anxious.

256
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,550
The real show is just beginning.

257
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,540
Do you think I would still trust your words?

258
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,180
Come with me,

259
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,290
and you'll see.

260
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,290
I've got what you wanted.

261
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,100
Well done.

262
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,950
If you want the pearl,

263
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,360
you'll have to give me the antidote first.

264
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,970
You deliberately let her get close to you

265
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,230
to take the Qiankun Pearl?

266
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,910
Otherwise, how could this good show go on?

267
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,120
When you ascend to the throne,

268
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,020
I also wish to enjoy the riches and honor of being the Empress of the Six Palaces.

269
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,190
Who gave you the nerve

270
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,569
to negotiate with me?

271
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,990
You're going too far!

272
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,140
I can't stand it any longer.

273
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,570
If there is no antidote,

274
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,750
your poison will flare up every other day

275
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,850
until you die from blood seeping out of your seven orifices.

276
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,910
This is what happens

277
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,960
when you go against me.

278
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,320
Ye Mingxuan?

279
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,080
is it him?

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,260
This voice sounds so familiar.

281
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,920
You don't need to guess.

282
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,700
Just follow and see for yourself.
