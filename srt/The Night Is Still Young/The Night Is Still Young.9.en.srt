How dare you use a dragon as a sacrifice?

6
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,100
Third Prince,

7
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,900
the Qiankun Pearl you requested has been placed in the formation.

8
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,280
Mission accomplished.

9
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,840
You're spewing lies!

10
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,750
When did I ever tell you to steal the Qiankun Pearl?

11
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,320
Third Prince, you can't deny that!

12
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,370
Without your backing,

13
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,550
no matter how bold I am,

14
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,740
I wouldn't dare do such a thing!

15
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,580
Well, well,

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,940
you dare to slander me!

17
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,220
As fo the facts,

18
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,580
you can explain them before His Majesty.

19
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,800
Your Majesty,

20
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,389
these were all found in the cave.

21
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,610
This is the Spirit-Binding Curse.

22
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,130
This is my birthday.

Father, I've been wronged!

26
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,900
I received a lead

27
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,880
and went to the cave to search for the Qiankun Pearl.

28
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,170
It's him. He's framing me!

29
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,010
King Yan,

30
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,780
what are the facts?

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Let me investigate further,

32
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,010
and the truth will reveal itself.

33
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,120
Huo Dao,

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,810
you are the Fifth Prince's man.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,570
Why were you in the cave with the Third Prince?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,110
I dare not deceive you.

37
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,400
I was ordered by the Third Prince to find the Qiankun Pearl.

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,030
After obtaining it today,

39
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,190
I delivered it to the cave as instructed by the Third Prince.

40
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,150
You're talking nonsense!

41
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,520
You're twisting the truth!

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,750
You grew up with the Fifth Prince,

43
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,010
willing to risk your life for him.

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,590
Finding the Qiankun Pearl is such a great achievement.

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,420
Why didn't you present it to your own master?

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,320
I...

47
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,130
Did you betray your master,

48
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,890
or is there something else going on?

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,790
Tell the truth.

50
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,330

[House deed in Ye City]

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,930
This...

53
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,410
I clearly gave the East Suburb Villa

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,579
to Wanniang, the top courtesan at Beauty House.

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,050
How did it end up with you?

56
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,430
Did the Third Prince really give this to you?

57
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,930
You betrayed your master

58
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,510
just for a villa?

59
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,300
A villa alone is not something too valuable,

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,440
but what about the positions of Grand Commander and Grand General?

61
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,220
I've been practicing martial arts since I was three years old,

62

The poison is in his teeth.

it's my fault for failing to properly instruct my servants.

Ye Mingxuan is truly ruthless.

85

To save himself,

86
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,880
he didn't even hesitate to sacrifice his right-hand man.

87
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,060
Drag this insolent servant out as well.

88
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,100
Lest he sullies my imperial study.

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,900
Although this matter does not concern you directly,

90
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,630
it is still due to your negligence in instructing your subordinates.

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,750
Go back and reflect on this thoroughly.

92
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,430
I will heed Your Majesty's teachings.

93
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,700
You may rise.

94
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,630

No matter what,

the Qiankun Pearl has finally been recovered.

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,260
In recovering the Qiankun Pearl this time,

101
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,720
King Yan deserves the highest merit.

102
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,860
I was not mistaken.

103
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,740
King Yan is indeed experienced in statecraft.

104
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,220
The Qiankun Pearl has been missing for so many days.

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,360
It's time for it to be returned to its rightful place.

106
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,540
I command you to personally return the Qiankun Pearl to its original position

107
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,150
to secure the foundation of our nation.

108

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,360
His Majesty, considering your plea,

111
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,030
has pardoned the Third Prince from the death penalty.

112
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,200
However, he cannot escape other punishment.

113
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,920
He has been demoted to a commoner and sent to Lingnan.

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,460
After learning that the Qiankun Pearl had been returned,

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,810
the people of Ye City took to the streets to celebrate.

116
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,230
It's King and Queen Yan.

117
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,770
They are the ones who retrieved the Qiankun Pearl.

118
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,060
By dipping the cypress branch in holy water and brushing it over the body,

119
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,590
the illness and misfortune can be swept away.

120

Yes, Your Highness.

123
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,100
I wish for the people of Great Ye to be healthy and harmonious.

124
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,350

now that the Queen has glimpsed the true nature of the Fifth Prince,

139
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,470
even if just a little.

140
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,350
This way,

141
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,980
the misunderstanding between you and her will also be resolved.

142
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,940
The sooner she sees through Ye Mingxuan,

143
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,670
the sooner she'll be out of danger.

144
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,500
When that time comes, the Queen

145
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,190
will surely understand your good intentions

146
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,060
and your love.

147
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Your Highness, I…

148
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,150
That's enough.

149
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,070
No need to go further.

150
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,410
My Queen, unable to sleep late at night,

151
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,400
who are you worrying about?

152
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,530
I'm thinking about Ye Mingxuan.

153
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,330
The figure who injured Huan Yan

154
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,630
and stole the Qiankun Pearl

155
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,950
bears a 70% resemblance to him.

156
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,570
Was Huo Dao really bought by the Third Prince,

157
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,290
or was he just his scapegoat?

158
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,120
The answer to this question is actually quite simple.

159
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,790
The answer is in your heart.

160
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,710
I'm naturally very familiar with his figure,

161
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,410
but that person's appearance

162
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,900
was completely different from

163
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,690
his usual gentle and refined self.

164
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,230
But pretending to be pure and kind

165
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,550
is his specialty.

166
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,930
A man should be as clear as ten thousand miles.

167
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,010
And he should be as bright as the sun and moon.

168
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,800
Good thing we agreed on a secret signal beforehand.

169
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,230
Otherwise, during the day at the Beauty House,

170
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,560
if you had pushed open the door,

171
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,790
the consequences would've been unimaginable.

172
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,890
What's the point of dodging it once?

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,890
In the end, it was all for nothing.

174
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,370
After all,

175
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,560
you still managed to be cleared of charges

176
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,270
and successfully frame the Third Prince.

177
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,090
You've narrowly escaped the disaster.

178
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,860
This time, I had to pay a hefty price to save myself.

179
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,860
I really had no other choice.

180
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,680
It's a pity to lose such a capable assistant.

181
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,740
Ye Beichen used Huan Yan

182
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,540
to turn the tables on me.

183
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,360
We stole the Qiankun Pearl

184
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,340
to create chaos in Great Ye.
