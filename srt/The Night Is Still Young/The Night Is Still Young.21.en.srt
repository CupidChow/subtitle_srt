00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,230
Today, when I went out,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,960
I saw a few rich young men

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,240
harrassing Miss Huan Yan.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,320
They knew she had lost protection at the King Yan's Mansion。

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,730
That's why they dared to be so reckless.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,480
Ye Beichen,

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,400
no matter what, Huan Yan is still the daughter of the Imperial Advisor.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,030
The Imperial Advisor was your first teacher.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,590
I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,360
Brother Beichen,

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,300
I was ignorant before

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,690
and made those mistakes.

18
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,290
But I have no parents.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,950
If you don't take care of me,

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,800
I'll truly have no one to rely on.

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,650
Since Weiyang has pleaded for you,

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,730
you may stay in the side courtyard for now.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
But I hope you'll behave yourself.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,370

29

Peach blossom wine.

30

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,830
The name is quite unique.

32

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,650
this is a custom from my mother's hometown.

my father went to great lengths

42
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,800
to store this wine for me.

43

Why not save it for when you're successful?

53
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,890
I'm so foolish

54

♫These stars that fill the sky♫

368
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,230
Weiyang,

369
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,230
♫The fate of love and hate, separation and union♫

370
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,940
come back to the mansion with me.

371
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,070
Ye Beichen,

372
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,830
♫Blame the depth of our love♫

373
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,770
stop using those

374
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,590
childish tricks to deceive me.

375
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,680
Do you think I'll still believe your lies?

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,800
♫Meeting you feels like encountering an old friend♫

377
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,330
I only hate myself for being so blind

378
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,720
♫As if in a past life, passing by the door♫

379
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,370
and not realizing sooner

380
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,550
♫The past is hard to keep, attachment leaves no trace♫

381
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,370
that Ye Mingxuan is the one who treats me best.

382
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,240
Ye Beichen, from now on,

383
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,070
♫How can I join you in this life♫

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,370
through the six realms of reincarnation,

385
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,050
♫If the soul doesn't cross, if the person doesn't return♫

386
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,250
let's never meet again.

387
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,080
♫Could you lend me the rise and fall of the next life♫

388
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,410
♫If fate protects us♫

389
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,080
♫In the midst of heavy snow♫

390
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,140
♫Eternal love through the ages♫

391
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,460
♫If love does not fail♫

392
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,120
It's neither a beautiful jade

393
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,360
♫In the depths of blooming flowers♫

394
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,280
nor gold or silver.

395
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,990
It's just a lump of iron.

396
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,840
♫Accompany you to the twilight years♫

397
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,490
Why do you always carry it with you?

398
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:45,890
♫If one life and one death are our destiny♫

399
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,630
Because it has saved my life more than once.

400
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,870
As long as I'm here, it will never leave my side.

401
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,320
Ye Beichen,

402
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,540
I have no choice but to take this gamble.
