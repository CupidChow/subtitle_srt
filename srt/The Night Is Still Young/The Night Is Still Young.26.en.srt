[The Night is Still Young]

2
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,720
[Episode 26]

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,220
Ye Beichen has meticulously plotted,

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,900
disguising himself as Ji Wuming to secretly enter the palace.

5
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,970
He must be planning to send Weiyang away

6
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,440
and rescue the Emperor.

7
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,950
Why don't I play along with him?

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,970
It'd be more interesting to make him lose everything,

9
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,010
leaving him without even a place to be buried.

10
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,510
Sorcerer King, you look well today.

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,150
It seems you have fully recovered.

12
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,600
You're here just in time to hear

13
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,110
the Crown Princess and me perform "Phoenix Seeking a Mate"

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,630
and see whether it can be considered a harmonious duet like a couple in sync.

15
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,360
I... know nothing of music.

16
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,729
My zither skills are not proficient.

17
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,060
I'm sorry for spoiling your mood.

18
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,070
It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,710
Today is our wedding day.

20
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,430
We will perform this piece again together.

21
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,390
But... but according to the Sorcerer King,

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,430
today should be the day I leave the palace.

23
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,920
However, I've also heard

24
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,680
that the Crown Prince, as heir to the throne,

25
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,610
is not bound by conventional etiquette.

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,450
But time is running short.

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm afraid the preparations might not be adequate.

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,830
Don't worry.

29
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,350
I've already had everything needed

30
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,890
for the wedding prepared.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,600
I'll send someone immediately to deliver them.

32
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,390
You can just go back and wait for the auspicious hour.

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,140
Go.

34
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,810
Then, please, Sorcerer King, pray to the gods for blessings on my behalf.

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,780
Crown Prince.

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,780
Keep a close eye on Weiyang and Ye Beichen for me.

37
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,810
If there's any unusual movement,

38
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,810
capture them immediately.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,050
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,610
[Grace and Talent]

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,680
[Grace and Talent]

42
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,250
My lady,

43
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,230
is there really no other way?

44
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,060
Ye Mingxuan is already getting suspicious.

45
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,260
He is holding the wedding now

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,000
to test and take revenge.

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,510
My lady,

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,050
why don't you try to escape?

49
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,310
Even if it costs me my life,

50
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,530
I will help you escape.

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,200
From the moment I entered the Eastern Palace,

52
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,280
I never expected to leave alive.

53
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,350
But I believe

54
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,510
the King will certainly not stand by

55
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,680
and let you marry the Crown Prince.

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,960
It's all happening too suddenly.

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,380
If Ye Beichen comes to rescue me,

58
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,040
it will certainly disrupt his plans.

59
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,260
No, I can't hold him back.

60
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,050
Today, Ye Mingxuan and I

61
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,460
must settle our accounts once and for all.

62
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,600
Ye Beichen.

63
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,920
Tonight will be Ye Mingxuan's time of death.

64
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,090
I will personally slay my enemy

65
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,350
so that you can live on well.

why are you here?

122
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,010
How could I let you marry someone else?

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,370
♫A sword in the heart, a farewell waves over the land♫

124

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,820
Uncle.

126
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,880
Your timing couldn't be better.

127
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,000
Today, I will ruin your reputation,

128
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,780
making you the eternal sinner of Great Ye!

129
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,670
Ye Beichen won't just stand by

130
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,240
and watch Weiyang marry me.

131
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,300
He will surely show up to disrupt the wedding.

132
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,460
When that happens,

133
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,160
you'll lead the death warriors disguised as Eagle Guards.

134
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,440
First, deactivate the mechanisms in the Emperor's bedchamber,

135
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,990
then kill the Emperor.

136
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,370
Bring the Eagle Guards before everyone

137
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,790
and frame Ye Beichen for regicide.

138
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,860
Why are you still standing there?

139
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,950
Seize him for me!

140
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,660
Yes, Your Highness!

141
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,090
Shangguan's army, heed my command!

142
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,030
This is General Shangguan's military tally for the Imperial Guards,

143
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,710
bestowed by His Majesty himself.

144

♫The night is still young, I will not betray the people♫

145

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,059
♫Nor will I betray her♫

147
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,480
The bearer of this tally has the authority to command troops!

148
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,919
♫This empty city is so regrettable without you♫

149
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,980
Rebellious traitors, disrupting the state

150
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,090
♫Even if the skies fall♫

151
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,220
and endangering the Emperor!

152
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,900
Shangguan's army, join me in eliminating these traitors immediately!

153
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,310
♫Covering my eyes♫

154
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,330
♫In the next life, no more separations♫

155

It's you!

156
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,290
Ye Mingxuan,

157
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,030
I've been waiting

158
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,510
for the moment when you men turned off the mechanisms.

159
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,110
You've saved me a lot of trouble.

160
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,270
Ye Mingxuan's sudden decision to hold a wedding

161
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,830
must be a ploy to draw me out.

162
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,340
I suspect

163
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,420
he's trying to use others to do his dirty work.

164
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,700
And the best way

165
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,100
is to have his men,

166
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,120
disguised as Eagle Guards, kill the Emperor

167
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,650
and then frame me for it.

168
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,850
Ye Mingxuan's intentions are indeed sinister.

169
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,760
However, this works in our favor.

170
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
He plans to kill the Emperor,

171
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,710
so he'll surely deactivate the mechanisms around His Majesty's bed.

172
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,820
We'll turn his plan against him,

173
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,300
using him

174
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,850
to solve our most troublesome problem.

175
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,610
I have already rescued His Majesty.

176
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,710
Your crime of attempting to kill His Majesty is a capital offense.

177
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,090
Surrender now!

178
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,580
Who wins and who loses is still uncertain.

179
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
Quick, pursue him!

180
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,110
Yes, sir!

181
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,550
Are you alright?

182
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,750
All the soul-breaking needles have been removed.

183
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,880
What has happened to me?

184
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,430
What's going on?

185
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,350
I thought Ye Mingxuan was merely ambitious,

186
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,030
but I never imagined he could be so vicious

187
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,320
as to commit such vile and treacherous crimes.

188
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,880
I didn't notice any of it over all these years.

189
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,520
It's just that Ye Mingxuan was too good at disguising himself.

190
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,090
Even I was kept in the dark by his scheming for many years.

191
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,960
His evil ambitions had yet to come to fruition,

192
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,690
so of course, he had to keep them well hidden.

193
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,420
Things have come to this point

194
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,190
all because of my selfish desires.

195
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,380
I only wanted to pass the throne

196
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,350
to my own son.

197
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,140
I shall personally issue an imperial decree,

198
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,500
offering a substantial reward for Ye Mingxuan's whereabouts.

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Should he dare cause further unrest,

200
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,590
he may be executed immediately on the spot.

201
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,520
Brother.

202
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,790
Weren't all the soul-breaking needles

203
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,010
removed from His Majesty's body?

204
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,150
How could this happen?

205
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,490
I know my body

206
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,250
is beyond repair.

207
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,840
My condition is beyond medical help now.

208
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,120
Everyone must die eventually,

209
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,920
and I am no exception.

210
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,370
But what concerns me most

211
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,630
is Great Ye.

212
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,200
I made the mistake of treating the empire

213
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,470
as my own,

214
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,380
without considering the common people of my Great Ye.

215
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,430
Now I understand.

216
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,800
What Great Ye needs

217
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,400
is an emperor of both virtue and talent.

218
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,150
Beichen.

219
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,630
I want to entrust Great Ye to you

220
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,350
and have you ascend to the throne.

221
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,220
Brother,

222
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,350
I have fought on the battlefield for many years.

223
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,330
I have no interest in court affairs.

224
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,830
Please reconsider your decision, brother.

225
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,160
This is not just my will.

226
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,460
I speak on behalf of the millions of people of Great Ye

227
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,560
to entrust the empire to you.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,080
You have repeatedly rendered meritorious service to this nation.

229
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,160
You can defend against foreign enemies and guard our borders

230
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,160
while maintaining order and quelling unrest within.

231
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,850
With you as emperor,

232
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,860
both the court and country will find stability,

233
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,020
and the people can live in peace and prosperity.

234
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,320
By the mandate of Heaven,

235
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,160
the Emperor decrees:

236
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,970
I accept the gracious mandate of Heaven

237
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,540
and the command of the late Emperor.

238
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,320
I hereby designate my brother to ascend the throne

239
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,200
and solemnly announce this to Heaven and Earth.

240
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,910
A general amnesty is granted to all under heaven.

241
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,580
Let a new era dawn with the people

242
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,990
to forge a new governance together.

243
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,770
The late Emperor has passed away.

244
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,980
By ancestral tradition, the entire realm should observe mourning.

245
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,930
However, with the rebel still at large,

246
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,710
stabilizing the state is the top priority.

247
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,000
♫The wind stirs the war flames, and the rain-soaked fur returns with the geese♫

248
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,250
The senior ministers have discussed and decided

249
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,490
♫In the capital, the pace of carriages and horses is slow♫

250
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,310
that the new Emperor should ascend the throne in the presence of the coffin of the late Emperor.

251
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,860
The coronation ceremony shall remain simple.

252
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,300
♫Several lifetimes of devotion, yet this bond remains unresolved♫

253
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,070
I guarded the borders, repelled enemies,

254
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,160
and rooted out traitors and rebels

255
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,170
♫Entangled in grudges, love hangs by a thread♫

256
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,030
not to become emperor.

257
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,660
♫Unable to part with the eyes♫

258
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,990
I know.

259
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,170
You did it for the countless subjects of Great Ye.

260
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,170
♫I point to the moon, questioning beneath it, before the city tower♫

261
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,430
As the elder brother passes, the younger brother ascends.

262
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,340
♫She's in red♫

263
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,610
Are you worried

264
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,200
♫With angry eyes, a word severs grudges♫

265
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,040
that future generations

266
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,120
will leave an unjust evaluation of you in history books?

267
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,870
♫A sword in the heart, a farewell waves over the land♫

268
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,200
I don't care how those historians write.

269
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,290
♫This life has slipped away, the next life will be complete♫

270
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,220
I care only

271
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,570
♫A heart of purest jade♫

272
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,020
that Great Ye's lands

273
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,140
♫In the dim night, searching for her, past a thousand sails♫

274
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,280
remain vast and fertile.

275
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,880
♫Watching the snow fall, year after year♫

276
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,420
♫The song is not over, making a promise to grow old together♫

277
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,430
You're worried that you can't bear this burden

278
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,590
♫The night is still young, I will not betray the people♫

279
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,860
and that you'll let down the royal ancestors and the people.

280
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,650
♫Nor will I betray her♫

281
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,420
As a descendant of the royal family,

282
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,650
♫This empty city is so regrettable without you♫

283
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,040
if I could be like Pangu...

284
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,770
with my flesh becoming mountains

285
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,710
♫Even if the skies fall♫

286
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,710
and my blood forming rivers

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,310
to nourish the people,

288
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,900
♫Covering my eyes♫

289
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,910
wouldn't that also be a kind of perfection?

290
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,010
♫In the next life, no more separations♫

291
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,170
Our Shangguan family has been loyal for generations.

292
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,150
Rest assured.

293
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,680
I will stand alongside you

294
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,370
to guard Great Ye.
