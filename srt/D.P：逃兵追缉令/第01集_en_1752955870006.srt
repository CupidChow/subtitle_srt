They came in August…

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,240
Private An Jun-ho, sir.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,410
[man] You fucking bastard.
I just don't like how you look.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,370
Stand in position.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,280

No, sir.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,760

Yes?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,710
What about the change?

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,550
I know it's just 500 won,
but you still shouldn't fool a kid.

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,680
I gave it to him.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,970
Then are you saying my kid's lying?

32
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,560
Gosh, forget it. That's enough.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,140
But he's lying to us.

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,230
[man] Okay, I get it. You can go.

35

[creaks open]

40
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,720
I didn't lie.

…with respecting your comrades
and establishing an army

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,230

Yes, of course. You're totally right.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,780
-[man 1] Hey, you're back.
-I should've educated my staff better.

48

I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,870
Yes.

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,330
Thank you. Goodbye.

51
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,170
Hey!

52
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,010
What the hell did you do on the delivery?

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,800
I didn't do anything.

54
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,010
You fucking asshole.

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,350
[newcaster talking on TV]

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,520
You disrespectful punk.

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,190
Hey, you're fired.

58
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,360
-[manager] Don't come to work tomorrow.
-I can't come starting tomorrow anyway.

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,690
Give me my overdue pay
including what you owe me for today.

60
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,190
You darn punk.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,240
I told you I'll pay you next week.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,030
You said the same thing last week.

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,450
[manager] I see.

64
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,660
Is that why you took the change?

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,920
This is why I shouldn't hire people
who weren't raised properly.

66
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,290
What are you staring at, you punk?

67
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,300
I said you're fired.

68
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,510

-What are you doing? Get off! You punk!

74
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,900
Hey, you punk! Hey!

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,610
[manager] You damn thief!

76
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,480
I'll kill you if I ever catch you!

77
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,030
[engine revs]

78
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,950

79
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,210
[upbeat music playing continues]

80
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
[manager] You crazy jerk!

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,940
Do you want to end up in jail?
I'll report you to…

82
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,530
[Jun-ho] Do whatever you want.

83
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,700
I'll report you for violating
the labor law and not paying me.

84
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,370
-[manager] What? What did you say?
-I'm going to hang up. I'm late.

85
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,580
Hey!

86
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,750
[repairman] Excuse me.

87
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,290
The motorcycle is in good condition.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,710
-[puffs]
-I'll wire you the money now.

89
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,960
[Jun-ho] Yes, thank you.

90
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,010
I WIRED SOME MONEY TO HER ACCOUNT

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,930
I DON'T NEED IT,
SO TELL MOM SHE CAN USE IT

92
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,180
AND DON'T LET DAD DRINK WHILE I'M GONE

93
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,010
[rain pouring]

94
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,190

[indistinct chatter]

100
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,490
[instructor 4]
Line up with the person in front of you.

101
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,910
Stretch out your arms.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,080
[soldier] Attention!

103
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,840

108
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,980
This is the end
of the enlistment ceremony.

109
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,940
[commander] I wish all family members
a safe journey back home amid the rain.

110
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,400
Parents,

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,740
-please do not worry about your children.
-[cell phone buzzes]

112
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,910
These men have proudly become a member
of the Korean army,

113
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,040
and I promise we will nurture them
into strong men

MOM

117
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait until it's your turn.

118
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,250
[woman] Lee Jae-chang!

119
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,760
I'll wait for you
until you get discharged!

120
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,010
So finish your military service
and make me proud!

121
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,800
Seon-hwa!

122
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,600
[crowd cheer]

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,270
That fucking asshole.

124
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,400
[cheering continues]

125
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,990
[instructor 6] What are you doing?
Is there a problem?

126
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,410
[man breathes heavily]

127
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,280
[whispers] This is killing me.

128
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,160
[instructor 6] Everyone. Are you tired?

129
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,540
[breathes shakily]

130
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,420
Get to your senses.

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,300
Starting from today, you are soldiers.

132
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,880
If you take over a minute to change,
that means you're a civilian.

133
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,010
That's not a soldier. Do you agree?

134
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,600
[recruits] I'm sorry, sir!

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,970
[commander] How are things going?

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,470
-[instructor 6] Salute.
-[commander] Salute.

137
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,810
Everyone, on your feet.

138
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,900
You're not soldiers yet.

139
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,070
Does that mean you're a civilian?

140
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,650
Of course not.

141
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,900
Then what are you?

142
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,120
You are nothing but new recruits.

143
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,710
You'll be training for five weeks
until you're assigned to your units.

144
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,710
Until then, don't think.

145
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,250
All you need to do
is just train your asses off.

146
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,550
[recruits] Yes, sir!

147
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,470
[commander] I don't hear you!
Do you understand?

148
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,840
[recruits] Yes, sir!

149
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,680
[recruits] Train like you're in battle!
Train like you're in battle!

150
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,730
-[trainer] Soldiers, march!
-[recruits] Train like you're in battle!

151
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,980
[recruit] Gosh, how do you do this?

152
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,020
[instructor 6]
Three minutes until roll call.

153
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,440
Recruits. Are you going to spend all night
folding your blankets?

154
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,190
Get to your senses!

155
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,200
[recruits] Train like you're in battle!
Train like you're in battle!

156
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,660
[recruits shout]

157
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,910
-[instructor 1] Pick up your rifle!
-[instructor 2] One!

158
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,280
[instructor 1]
Who told you to drop your rifle?

159
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,990
[instructor 2] To the goalpost and back
by order of arrival!

160
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,370
[recruits] Train like you're in battle!
Train like you're in battle!

161
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,000
Train like you're in battle!

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,670
[instructor 1]
Meal time ends in three minutes!

163
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,590
[instructor 2] Take off your gas masks!

164
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,680
[instructor 3] "I can do it!"

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,640
Stop them from getting out!

166
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,180
I told you not to breathe.

167
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,560
Is it so hard to hold your breath
for three seconds? One.

168
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,940
-[recruits] We are…
-[instructor 3] Two.

169
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,100
[recruits] …one!

170
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,020
[instructor 3] One.

171
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,230
[recruits] We are…

172
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,940
[instructor 1]
Meal time ends in one minute!

173
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,780
[instructor 2] Stay focused.
You're almost there.

174
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,990
-Repeat after me. "I can do it."
-[recruits] I can do it!

They're from my mother, sir.

350
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,250
[officer] All of them?

351
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,330
Yes, sir.

352
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,630
-You haven't opened any of them.
-[thuds]

353
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,170
Jun-ho, you're an ungrateful son.

354
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,680
[paper rustles]

355
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,220
[officer] "Dear, my son, Jun-ho.

356
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,890
Jun-ho.

357
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm writing to you again with concern.
I hope the training isn't too difficult.

358
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,150
Do you eat and sleep well?

359
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,860
I feel bad that there's nothing I can do
while you're there.

360
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,240
I know you're in the army now,

361
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,700
but I sometimes forget that
and cook a serving for you two."

362
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,620
"You two"?

363
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,120
Isn't it supposed to be "too"?

364
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,790
[officer chuckles]
Anyway…

365
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,630
"I got a 50,000 won raise
at my new workplace.

366
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,300
Thanks to that, Su-jin and I are able
to have chicken two times a month now.

367
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,550
[officer laughs]

368
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,640
I'll save up so you'll be able to eat
whatever you want

369
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,470
once you visit soon.

370
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,060
From, your loving mother."

371
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,980
[exclaims in awe]

372
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,850
This is so fucking touching.

373
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,060
Your mother got a 50,000 won raise.

374
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,070
What is this?

375
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
Are you a bum?

376
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,570
No, sir.

377
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,490
Then what?

378
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,410
Is your mom a bum?

379
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,040
Can you please stop, sir?

380
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,420
What?

381
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,680
Bring me a rifle.

382
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,560
I'll just shoot this bastard
and desert the army.

383
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,270
-Bring it to me, you asshole!
-[opens]

384
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,150
[officers] Salute.

385
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,190
[sighs]
Salute, my ass.

386
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,400
Why don't you take your rifle
and walk into prison yourself?

387
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,030
[man]
I can't be fucked going after deserters.

388
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,780
-Sir, the thing is…
-[man] You punks.

389
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,950
Go weed the garden if you're bored!

390
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,750
Or shake the dust off your blankets.

391
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,370
Get moving!

392
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,710
[man] These useless bums…

393
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,800
Hey, new recruit.

394
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,760
Private An Jun-ho, sir.

395
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,470
Aren't you coming for an interview?

396
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,730
[instructor] Cool man!

397
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,230
[soldiers] Cool man!

398
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,900
[soldier 1] In one, two, three, four!

399
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,150
[soldiers chanting]
There are lots of cool men

400
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,190
[instructor] Louder!

401
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,780
[distant soldiers chanting]

402
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,290
I am invincible, and I love passionately

403
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,470
Salute. Private An Jun-ho reporting
to the investigation division, sir.

404
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,130
[man] Okay, come and sit down.

405
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,560
Are you doing okay here?

406
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,520
[Jun-ho] Yes, sir.

407
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,980
Bullshit. I know it sucks.

408
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,650
-No, sir.
-Is anyone in your family a commie?

409
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,110
I don't know, sir.

410
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,110
Are any of your college friends
student activists?

411
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,990
I don't go to college, sir.

412
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,570
I guess you played sports.

413
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,950
[man] Boxing?

414
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,450
Not anymore, sir.

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,660
You look so impassive
for someone so young.

416
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,840
What's the color of my socks?

417
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,130
Gray with checkered patterns, sir.

418
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,390
Stand up.

419
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,940
[cell phone buzzes]

420
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,820
PROMOTION NOTICE

421
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,030
[commander] Shit.

422
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,700
[sucks teeth]
Wait here for a second.

423
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
[bangs]

424
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,870
Salute.

425
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,380
MILITARY POLICE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

426
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
[man] Mm. Come in.

427
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,390
Salute.

428
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,720
Hey, Sergeant Park.

429
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,680
Sir, about the promotion…

430
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,390
Goodness.
[clicks tongue]

431
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,690
I was actually going to talk to you
about that.

432
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,690
It's a real pity, right?

433
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,780
I know there are things
I need to improve on,

434
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,700
but we've been performing well and…

435
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,240
Yes, of course. I know that.
You're good enough

436
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,490
to be more than a first sergeant.

437
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,790
-Then why--
-Why is this plant so dull?

438
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,500
[man] Forget about that.
Why don't we go for some drinks?

439
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,840
[distant clamor]

440
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,260

[opens]

446
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,060
[man] Are you thinking of a plan
to desert the army?

447
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,480
[Jun-ho] No, sir.

448
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,100
[man] Then why aren't you saluting me?

449
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,770
Salute.

450
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,280
Who are you even saluting to?
Do you know who I am?

451
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,990
You're Corporal Park Sung-woo, sir.

452
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,570
Okay, what do I do?

453
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,280
-Aren't you a D.P. soldier?
-[Sung-woo] What is a D.P. soldier?

454
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,160
Guys who grow out their hair
and take strolls outside?

455
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,750
I heard your job
is to catch deserted soldiers, sir.

456
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,840
-Kind of like detectives--
-No, you punk.

457
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,170
What does D.P. stand for?

458
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,130
I'm sorry. I'm not sure, sir.

459
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,930
I don't know either.

460
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,640
Everyone calls us D.P. soldiers.

461
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,610
But no one knows what it means.

462
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,520
[sucks teeth]
I bet Park Beom-gu doesn't know either.

463
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,820
Isn't that funny?

464
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,780
Yes, it's funny, sir.

465
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,490
Gosh, it's the perfect weather
to be outside.

466
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,700
If you're going to run away,
make it quick.

467
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,160
I haven't been out lately
since we haven't had any deserters.

468
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,370
I need to get my dick wet. Shit.

469
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,670
[chuckles]

470
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,670
Okay?

471
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
Yes, sir.

472
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,720
"Yes, sir"? You fucking prick.

473
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,220
Are you saying
you're going to desert the army?

474
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,350
No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

475
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
[scoffs]

476
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,230
I'm just kidding.

477
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,770
[laughs]

478
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,570
Gosh, it was a joke. I'm sorry.

479
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,490
Have a cigarette. It's from the outside.
Have a good one.

480
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,740
Salute.

481
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,160
[Sung-woo] Tell Beom-gu I was here.

482
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,370
[door closes]

[door opens]

488
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,430
Salute.

489
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,930
You're still here.

490
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,010
[Jun-ho] You told me to wait.

491
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,600
Are you dumb or sly?

492
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,940
[Beom-gu] You can go.

493
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,480
Yes, sir.

494
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,070
[Beom-gu sighs]
What's the fucking point looking for them?

495
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,160
[clicks tongue]

496
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,620
Excuse me, sir.

497
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Yes, what is it?

498
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,580
Deserters…

499
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,880
can't use their ID cards, right?

500
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,670
What?

501
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,210
If they weren't for his girlfriend,

502
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,090
he might be working as a waiter
at a hostess bar.

503
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,930
Some customers ask the waiters
to go buy flowers

504
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,680
so they can give them to a hostess.

505
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,230
Anyone can work at hostess bars.

506
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,520
-Even a deserter--
-You fucking moron.

507
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,610
Who told you you could look at these?

508
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,230
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Get out.

509
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,860
Salute.

You know what I'm in charge of, right?

516
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,030
Thank you. Yes, sir. I do.

517
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,320
What am I in charge of?

518
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,900
You're in charge of deserters, sir.

519
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,450
[soldier 1] He pisses me off.

520
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,950
Seriously. What's his deal?

521
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,740
He's talking to Sergeant Park.

522
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,250
[soldier 2] Who knows?
Maybe he wants a new D.P.

523
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,080
Is that even possible?

524
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,040
[soldier 1 grunts]

525
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,880
