178
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,640
Take a look. This is where
Jeong Hyeon-min's father lives.

179
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,310
And this is where his girlfriend lives.

180
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,310
They're busy,

181
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,440
so just keep it short.

182
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,020
I'm sorry, sir.

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,690
You just need to go here.

184
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,820
We'll go to his father's place instead.

185
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,660
You're okay with that, right?

186
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,320
Okay, sure. Go ahead.

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,490
[Gyu] We'll be off.

188
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,330
Thank you in advance.

[tranquil music playing in the restaurant]

191
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,920
This is annoying.

192
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,130
They must use good beans.

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,840
I love the acidity.

194
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,680
Why did you act that way earlier?

195
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,350
Well, you see, I don't like Choco Pies.

196
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,480
But I really craved them
when I was in boot camp.

197
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,900
So I went to church and got one.

198
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,190
But instead of eating it,
I kept it in my locker.

199
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,610
Why do you think I did that?

200
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,360
So I could save it
until the fifth week of training

201
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,950
and have it once it was all over.

202
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,040
But there's this jerk who stole it.

203
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,620
What would you have done?

204
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,670
I would have killed him.

205
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,790
Kim Gyu was that asshole.
But he doesn't remember.

206
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,500
He's one sick son of a bitch.

207
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,880
Hold it in. Stay put.

208
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,800
This is no longer a joke.
We're going to catch Jeong Hyeon-min.

209
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,720
His girlfriend's place
is obviously not important.

It's Jeong Hyeon-min's father's address.
I memorized it.

I'm impressed you caught that.

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,900
[car alarm blares]

357
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,320
[Hyeon-min grunts]

358
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,400
[Hyeon-min sucks teeth, chuckles]

359
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,950
[Beom-gu] How did it go?

360
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,950
I'm in front of building 25.

361
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,830
-What the heck are you saying?
-I don't know which building this is.

362
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,880
[Ho-yeol] And unfortunately,
I'm unable to move right now.

363
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,880
-[sighs, groans]
-[distant siren blaring]

364
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
[Ho-yeol grunts]

365
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,090
[indistinct PA chatter]

366
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,260
Standing fights are useless.

367
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,390
Grappling is the best.

368
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,060
I just lost.

369
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,180
[strap rustles]

370
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,180
Stand up.

371
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,190
Stand up.

372
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,190
Give me your hand.

373
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,030
[grunts]

374
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,610
What do you think?

375
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
What are you doing?

376
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,450
It's the cobra clutch.

377
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,530
Tell me if it hurts too much.

378
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,200
-This is how you do it.
-[bone cracks]

379
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,700
-[whimpers]
-Gosh, I'm so sorry.

380
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,750
It's okay.

381
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,670
[groans]

382
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,460
-What am I going to do?
-Why don't we…

383
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,590
[Ji-seop] Yes, sir.

384
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,920
No, I'm sorry.
We weren't trying to get in the way.

385
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,510
They just wanted to help,
but things got out of hand.

386
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,930
I'm sorry. Yes.

387
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,680
Okay, sir. Salute.

388
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,270
[sighs]

389
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,350
I apologize, sir. I'll tell them
to come back and set things right.

390
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,230
Gosh, no wonder I didn't like you
from the start.

391
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,570
Do you really not know what you did wrong?

392
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Pardon?

393
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,360
[sighs]
Sergeant Park.

394
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,080
Why can't you do your job right
and catch deserters?

395
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,330
I helped so that you could
get more points,

396
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,080
but why did you have to make a mess?

397
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,960
Sergeant Park Beom-gu.

398
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,590
Sergeant Park Beom-gu, sir.

399
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,880
What? Are you offended now
that I'm not using honorifics?

400
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,180
Executive officers use honorifics
to sergeants just to be polite, okay?

401
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,100
We're just being nice
because we know how hard it is!

402
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,560
So show some damn respect when I'm around.

403
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,440
-[opens]
-Fuck! That fucking asshole!

404
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,450
[whispers]
Let's calm down.

405
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,200
[object thud softly]

406
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,290
Is everything okay, sir?

407
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,170
[sighs]

408
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,710
-Are Jun-ho and Ho-yeol at the hospital?
-Yes, sir.

409
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,090
How badly are they hurt?

410
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,130
They'll live, sir.

411
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,670
Yes, I'm sure they will.

412
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,800
Tell them to come back this instant.

413
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,840
Okay, sir.

414
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,430
By the way, did you hear, sir?

415
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,020
Jeong Hyeon-min's unit,
the 53rd Infantry Division of the CDC…

416
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,480
They're shooting Real Man there next week.

417
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,120
The division commander there
is from the military academy too.

418
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,660
He graduated ahead of the Captain.

419
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,920
Then they'll need to catch the deserter
before the shoot.

420
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,880
[Jun-ho] I'm sorry, sir.

421
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,380
[Ho-yeol grunts]

422
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,590
[Gyu]
Gosh, you seem to be doing okay, Ho-yeol.

423
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,180
[exhales]

424
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,350
What's your problem?

425
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,890
-You knew it was me, didn't you?
-[chuckles]

426
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,020
At first, I enjoyed seeing your reaction.

427
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,810
But it got out of hand.
[laughs]

428
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,900
Choco Pies.

429
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,690
[Seong-gon chuckles]

430
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,610
Are you having fun?

431
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,030
-Is this funny to you?
-[Seong-gon] Listen, mister.

432
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,740
-You messed up our mission.
-[Jun-ho] We messed it up?

433
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,120
This wouldn't have happened
if we worked together.

434
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,790
We were going to catch him,
but you got in the way.

435
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,920
Quit the bullshit and just drop it.

436
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,630
Right. How's your injury?

437
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,460
I heard you still haven't caught
the deserter who stabbed you.

438
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,010
[Gyu] Gosh, that was ages ago.
[sucks teeth]

439
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,930
You might never be able to catch him
if you get dismissed.

440
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm right, aren't I?

441
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,480
Why would I be dismissed?

442
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,480
We got in this mess
while trying to help you.

443
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,110
Yes, of course. I know that.

444
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,530
But our captain
seems to have called your unit…

445
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,950
and asked why you had to cause a mess
in our jurisdiction.

446
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,530
You should have done better.

447
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
[Gyu] Mm.

448
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,450
Hey,

449
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,960
have this and get better.

450
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,210
[Gyu] Let's go.

451
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,340
It's delicious.

452
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,470
[Seong-gon chuckles]

453
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,840
Sir!

454
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,970
Damn it.

455
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
-[dog barking tone from cell phone]
-[Ho-yeol sighs]

456
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,190
Salute. Corporal Han Ho-yeol,
returning to…

457
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,520
[Beom-gu] No, don't come.

458
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm sorry, sir?

459
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,860
Are you fucking deaf?

460
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,240
Don't come back
until you catch Jeong Hyeon-min.

461
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,740
I thought we were being disciplined.

462
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,040
I'll deal with it.
Just catch Jeong Hyeon-min.

463
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,750
Catch him before the CDC guys do.

464
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,210
We'll catch him even if it kills us.

465
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,170
You better catch him.

466
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,260
Jun-ho, we just got extra lives.

467
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,470
[in English] A bonus.

468
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,640
[in Hangul] Where should we begin?

469
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,680
[phone rings]

470
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,680
Hello, this is Private Heo Gi-yeong
at the Communications Security Office.

471
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,440
Salute. This is Private An Jun-ho, sir.

472
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,730
[Gi-yeong] Hey.

473
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,520
[Jun-ho]
Sir, can you trace an IP address for us?

474
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,860
No, I can't. This isn't the NIS.

475
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,320
First, get an interception warrant
for civilians.

476
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,110
It's for a soldier, not a civilian.

477
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
And not many, just one.

478
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,200
Who?

479
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,210
There's a guy named Kim Gyu.
He's a D.P. in the CDC.

480
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,130
[Jun-ho]
I'll buy you a Big Mac with bacon.

481
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,590
[sighs]

482
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,170
I can't believe you're trying to coax me
with food too.

483
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,420
I'll also get you six pieces of McNuggets.

484
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,760
[exclaims]

485
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,890
What's his name again?

486
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,560
[Gi-yeong] Kim Gyu?

487
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,230
I want mustard sauce.

488
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,150
[Jun-ho] Yes, we just got here, sir.

489
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,440
But are you sure
it's the department store, sir?

490
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,110
[Gi-yeong] Yes. Corporal Kim Gyu used
the Wi-Fi there for the last three days.

491
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,070
He came here to do a stakeout?

492
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,450
Not shopping?

493
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,450
Thank you, sir.

494
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,700
Over there.

495
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,500
Hello.

496
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,500
By any chance, have you seen this guy?

497
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,000
Some people came earlier and asked me
a bunch of questions about him.

498
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,550
[woman] What's going on?

499
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,880
So do you know him?

500
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,760
I said I don't know him that well.

501
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,970
He's Yeong-ok's boyfriend,
so I just said hello to him once.

502
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,930
"Yeong-ok"?

503
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,060
Just go.

504
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,600
I'm working right now.

505
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,020
[woman groans]
This is so annoying.

506
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,730
I know it's hard.

507
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,530
My little sister also worked
at a department store.

508
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,780
So I know how hard it is.

509
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,280
I figured you might need it.

510
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,670
It's waterproof.

511
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,420
Thank you.

512
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,840
Don't mention it. Thank you for this.

513
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,180
So Mun Yeong-ok
is Jeong Hyeon-min's girlfriend?

514
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,180
Yes.

515
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,400
Yeong-ok used to work here too,
but she took a long leave.

516
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,520
-She won't answer her phone either.
-[clicks tongue]

517
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,650
You said you met Jeong Hyeon-min once.
Where did you meet him?

518
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,110
Oh, well…

519
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,620
A shop.

520
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,370
What shop?

521
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,790
Well, you know where people drink

522
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,920
and sing…

523
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,760
-Ah…
-[woman] Mm.

524
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,880
With guys.

525
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,720
[woman] This job can be pretty stressful,
so we sometimes go to relieve our stress.

526
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,520
That night, after a team dinner,
we were deciding where to go.

527
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,020
Then Yeong-ok told us to follow her.

528
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,400
[host 1] That's just wrong. Yes.

529
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,570
[Ho-yeol] Right, does anyone know him?

530
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,780
Okay.

531
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,870
[host 1] Yes, of course. You're right.

532
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,450
Isn't this Hyeon?

533
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,790
-It's Hyeon.
-No, not today.

534
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,670
-Hey, Jjang-gu.
-Yes, okay.

535
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,880
-Weren't you close with Hyeon?
-I love you.

536
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,630
[host 1] Hyeon? What about him?

537
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,510
We're looking for him,
but it's very hard to reach him.

538
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,800
-He's like that. He's a grasshopper.
-"A grasshopper"?

539
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,050
He doesn't work for just one bar.
He freelances here and there.

540
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,850
Do you happen to know her?
Her name is Mun Yeong-ok.

541
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:04,980
[host 1 inhales deeply]

542
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,560
[background chatter]

543
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,230
Hey, this girl…

544
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,110
She's the one Hyeon tried to con.

545
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,950
She bought him a used car, paid his rent,
and even promised to wait

546
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,620
until he was discharged from the army.
I think she even paid off his prepayment.

547
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,910
[chuckles]
His prepayment.

548
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,830
[host 1] Where does she get all that money
working at a department store?

549
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,330
[host 3] I just don't get why anyone
would do something like that.

550
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,830
[Ho-yeol]
Jeong Hyeon-min is a real asshole.

551
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,540
He's not an asshole. He's trash.

552
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,880
Yes, he's trash.

553
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,670
Hey, Jun-ho.

554
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,760
My back hurts so much.
Can we go to a dry sauna first?

555
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,720
-There are 22.
-What? Dry saunas?

556
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,010
Host bars in Haeundae.

557
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,770
He freelances, so I'm sure
he's working in one of these bars.

558
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,140
Okay, let's go.

559
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,600
But let's go to a dry sauna first.

560
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,770
[groans]

561
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,820
[Ho-yeol] I'm dead serious.

562
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,480
It really hurts.

563
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,360
What is it?

564
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,740
[light music plays]

565
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,170
[Ho-yeol] Gosh, you lost.
Can you help me find…

566
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,540
-[gambler] Let's do this.
-Take a look. Have you seen him?

567
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,750
Take a look.

568
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,210
Gosh, I said I don't know him.

570
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,970
[Ho-yeol] Hey, wait.

571

-Before you go--
-I'm busy right now.

573
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,270
Gosh, you're handsome.

574
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,180
Me?

[light music playing continues]

576
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
[woman] What do you want?

577
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,030
[Jun-ho] I'm sorry.

578
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,580
[waiter] I really don't know.

579
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,830
-I'm not asking for much. Come on.
-Please, go.

580
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,920
-I know you're tired, so drink this.
-I don't know him.

581
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,260
May I help you?

582
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,970
-Hello, we're with the military police…
-[man] Welcome.

583
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,600
-Hey, I'm here.
-[host] Hey, Su-jin.

584
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,230
I prepared something nice for you
in room number five.

585
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,030
-Hey, take them to room number five.
-[women giggle]

586
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,360
[woman 1] Are you a host?

587
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,070
-No, we're--
-I've never seen you here before.

588
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,530
[host] These men are…

589
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,370
[Ho-yeol] You may have heard of us.

590
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,830
-Yes, we're hosts here.
-[women] Oh…

591
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,790

-[woman 3] They're cute.
-[women laugh]

595
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,800
What the heck are we doing?
Do I really have to wear this?

596
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Of course. What else can we do?

597
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,640
Mun Yeong-ok is head over heels
for Jeong Hyeon-min.

598
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,020
Do you think she'll gladly guide
two D.P. soldiers

599
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,860
to where her boyfriend is hiding
if we ask her where he is?

600
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,730
You got us in this mess,
so you'd better take responsibility.

601
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,820
Okay. You look pretty.
I'll meet you outside.

602
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,530

Seriously…

603
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,780
[Ho-yeol] You punk, just go inside.

604
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,290
-Please just go already.
-No, wait. Wait.

605
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,040
-Aren't you a D.P. soldier?
-I am, but this is wrong.

606
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,790
Mun Yeong-ok is inside.
Don't you want to catch Jeong Hyeon-min?

607
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,580
-We have to, but this isn't right.
-Forget it!

608
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,670
I'm done!

609
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,760
Do you think I want to do this?

610
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Listen, Jun-ho.

00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,630

I'm as passionate as a tiger.

to someone new.

619
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,450
The sorrowful eyes of Yeongwol,
Gangwon-do.

I hope you all brought your swimsuits.

621

The moment you look into his eyes,
you'll want to dive into them.

622
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,880
Let me introduce him to you.

623
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,210
Let him introduce himself.

624
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,840
[Ho-yeol] Mm-hmm.

625
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,090

I'd ask you to go to a motel?

No.

for Jeong Hyeon-min.

Whether you'd show up or not.

703

You don't have feelings for me, right?

704
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,720
I told you I have a boyfriend.

705
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,890
Where is he?

[female owner] Hey, Su-ae.

710
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,240
Is he your new boyfriend?

711
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,370
He's cute.

712
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,500
No, he's just my cousin.

-We're going to have lunch together.
-I see.

I thought you came to ask for money again.

715
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,920
Gosh, no.

716
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,470
But while we're on that subject,
can I get paid in advance for this month…

[owner] Hey.

You still need to pay me back
for your outfit and interest.

How annoying.

Are you asking for money
so you can give it to Hyeon-min again?

724
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,490
He always beats you
and asks you for money.

725
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,580
I'm worried about you.

726
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,790
Haven't you come to your senses yet?

If you need cash,
you need to find a different job.

And start sleeping with the customers.

731

What?

Who are you to ask me that?

745
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,510
You asked me for help.

877
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,710
-[Ho-yeol] Grappling is the best.
-[Seong-gon groans]

878
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,460
-My gosh.
-This is my fucking money, you asshole.

879
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,170
Fuck you, you fucking losers.

880
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,170
[Seong-gon] My gosh.

881
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,380
[Hyeon-min]
Don't you dare take that money!

882
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,600
10,000 WON, EVENT CERTIFICATE

883
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,640
[Gyu] What is this?

884
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,730
-[Hyeon-min] What the…
-Ho-yeol.

885
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,060
Where's my money?

886
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,190
What?

887
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,230
I don't know.

888
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,940
[Gyu] You don't know?

889
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,070
Are you serious right now?

890
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,780
[Hyeon-min] They're fucking gift vouchers!

891
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,450
[cell phone buzzes]

892
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,030
Hello?

893
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,420
[mysterious music plays]

894
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,760
-[wind gust]
-[birds chirp]

895
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,170
[Yeong-ok] I told you, didn't I?

896
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,720
Don't pity people too easily.

897
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,440
But you caught Hyeon-min,
thanks to me, right?

898
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,230
Don't hate me too much.

899
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,070
Okay?

900
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,870
But I really meant it

901
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,620
when I thanked you earlier.

902
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,010
[sighs]

903
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,550
[chuckles]

904
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,810
[mysterious music plays]

905
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,200
Hey, Sergeant Park!

906
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,580
[Beom-gu]
What brings you here at this hour?

907
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,540
I heard the D.P. guys
caught Jeong Hyeon-min.

908
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,250
Yes, sir.

909
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,370
Then why didn't you
hand him over to the CDC?

910
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,000
Because our boys caught him.

911
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,540
Hey!

912
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,050
Are you fucking kidding me?

913
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,720
[gasps]

914
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,550
You fucking listen to me,
Captain Lim Ji-seop, sir.

915
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,100
[groans, chuckles]

916
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,690
Do you know why executive officers
use honorifics to sergeants?

917
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,270
To be polite?

918
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,150
To show respect?

919
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,360
It's because you know you're fucked
the moment we open our mouths.

920
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,660
For example, how you sent our boys

921
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,950
on a mission during their leave
to suck up to the CDC division commander!

922
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,040
If you want me to show you respect…

923
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,420
you'd better earn it first.

924
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,840
-[Beom-gu] You got that?
-[Ji-seop sighs]

925
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,350
This is how you hold a racket.

926
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,490
-[door closes]
-[whispers] He's one scary son of a bitch.

927
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,370
Hey, are you kidding me?

928
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,500
You promised to hand over the deserter
if I lent you the money.

929
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,710
I had no other choice.
The higher-ups want us to bring him in.

930
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,290
He's our deserter.

931
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,000
We caught him.

932
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,880
[Gyu] What's your problem?

933
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,670
You only came to help.

934
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,340
I already have enough on my hands
because of the money.

935
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,260
Here you go.

936
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,350
[voice assistant]
The money has been successfully wired.

937
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,930
My mom's got a credit card too.

938
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,850
-Good night.
-[Gyu] Hey, Ho-yeol.

939
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,690
I almost forgot.

940
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,820
Thanks for this.

941
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,820
You little…

942
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,530
[crickets chirp]

943
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,070
[Gyu sighs]

944
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,960
I'm sorry you had to catch a deserter
while you were on your leave.

945
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,620
-It's okay, sir.
-It's okay, sir.

946
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,920
Don't think of slacking off
now that you're back from your leave.

947
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,420
Do your best in here too.

948
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,550
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

949
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,050
-[Ji-seop sighs]
-[Ho-yeol] Uh…

950
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,470
Does that mean we spent
our entire leave in Busan?

951
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,180
[Ji-seop sighs]

952
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:24,430
Are you a soldier or a civilian?

953
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,770
Do you want to go on another leave?

954
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,350
No, sir.

955
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,650
You D.P. assholes are always
thinking of ways to go outside.

956
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,480
You only cause trouble out there.

957
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,110
Aren't I right?

958
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,160
You won't be getting any more leaves.

959
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,370
You got that?

960
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,740
Jun-ho.

961
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,410
Your family called.

962
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,250
Your father collapsed.

963
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,550
[dramatic music plays]

964
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:03,350
[dramatic music playing continues]

965
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,430
[music ends]
