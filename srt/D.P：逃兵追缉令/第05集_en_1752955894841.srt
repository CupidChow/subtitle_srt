A full-scale search is a good idea,

77

but having a lot of men
doesn't really guarantee anything,

78

182
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,950
I'm going to head home.
I'm not feeling very well.

What do you want to know?

196
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,160
What is it that you want to ask?

197
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,250
What?

198
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,630
Are you here to play fucking detective
with your senior?

199
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,300
Is seniority what comes to mind
even at a time like this?

200
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,050
-What did you say, you jackass?
-Do you think you'll be okay

if we don't catch Private Cho?

If they start investigating this,

203

they'll find out about
all the irregularities in our unit.

How is that my fault? Fuck.
How am I to blame?

206

There were others who were worse.

What about Hwang Jang-soo, that asshole?

208
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,160
Does he get off the fucking hook
now that he's discharged?

209
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,370
Is it okay that he's back home now?

210

The IP address that accessed the server

287
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,850
was at a highway rest area.

288
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,650
That IP didn't show up again after that.

291
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,740
I've got no idea what he's trying to do.

292
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,450
If he really is on his way
to Hwang Jang-soo's place…

293
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,660
[Jun-ho] If the rest area is on the way
to Seoul, we don't have much time.

[sighs]
Of course.

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,460
But we need to know
where he'll be getting off.

I'll look into it again.

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,710
You should hurry up, sir.

you'll find investigators
and D.P. from other units.

There will be about 20 of them,
so get going without us.

[Gyu] Gosh, this is so annoying.

316
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,440
Why couldn't they tell us earlier
that it's been canceled?

317
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,780
Just a second, sir.

saying the operation was canceled.
