00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,260
Who?

182

[metal clanks]

183
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,640
It's not the end of the world.

184
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,190
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,940
[Beom-gu] What?

186
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,490
What are you sorry for?

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
You asked me to bring him back…

189
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,370
but I failed.

190
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,540
So what?

191
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,880
Pardon?

192
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,670
So what about that?

193
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,260
What are you going to do about that?

194
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,850
[sighs]
You can keep working as a D.P.

195
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,650
[Jun-ho] But about Shin Woo-suk…

196
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,480
He never would've deserted his post

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,070
if he didn't join the army
in the first place.

198
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,450
[Beom-gu] Does that even matter?

199
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,670
[footsteps retreating]

200
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
[Beom-gu] Get him out of there.

201
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,340
[gate opens]

202
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,630
[officer grunts]

203
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,130
I can't believe this shit.

204
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,720
How did he even get out?

205
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,390
Jun-ho, be honest with me.

206
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,060
Did you give Beom-gu a blowjob?

207
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,520
[soldiers laugh]

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,150
You did, right?

209
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,320
[officer] Or did you let him fuck you?

210
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,610
[soldiers laugh]

211
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,490
[officer] Look at his face.

212
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,410
Fucking bastard.
What's wrong with the military these days?

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,910
What do you mean?

214
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,950
Everything is just fine.

215
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,160
[sudden music sting]

216
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,620
What's going on?

217
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,090
Am I invisible?

218
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,880
[soldier 1] Corporal Han, you're back.

219
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,130
Aren't you going to salute him?

220
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,010
He's Corporal Han.
He's the one in charge of D.P.

221
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
[soldiers] Salute.

222
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,100
Salute.

223
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,390
Nice to see you guys.

224
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,850
Corporal Han, are you better now?

225
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,810
I'm going to die.

226
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,020
They say I'm terminally ill.

227
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,900
I heard Sung-woo was dismissed.

228
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,980
Because of that,
I have to take his place now.

229
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,820
I guess I'll have to do what I'm told.

230
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,490
Are you going to slack off
just like you did at the hospital?

231
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,660
Yes, sir. I think I was born to slack off.

232
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,500
I also love shrimp snacks.

233
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,630
Sergeant Hwang.
Aren't you being discharged soon?

234
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,760
Why do you keep acting like
you're the big shot here?

235
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Listen, Mr. Civilian.

236
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,140
Do you have no respect for your senior?

237
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,640
Didn't you know?

238
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,140
When you're close to getting discharged,
you're no different from a civilian.

239
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,690
You two D.P. assholes are pissing me off.

240
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,150
One more word,
and I'll rip your mouth open.

241
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,280
"One more word."

242
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,030
-You asshole.

245
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,620
Are you having a rap battle or something?

246
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm going to watch a TV show,
so shut the fuck up and sit down.

247
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,210
[soldiers] Yes, sir.

248
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,170
[Jeong-su] Good.

249
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,800
[woman speaking on TV]

250
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,760
Hey, you must be An Jun-ho, my junior.

251
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,850
[woman speaking on TV continues]

254
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,110
Mm.

255
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,820
The hot water melts the grease
from the noodles,

256
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,200
and that grease melts the package,
which creates endocrine disruptors.

257
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,780
It's really bad for you.

258
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,790
[slurps]

259
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,910
But it's delicious.

260
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,630
It's so good that I can't stop eating.

261
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,340
Maybe it tastes so good
thanks to all the endocrine disruptors.

262
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,550
What do you think?

263
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,880
I don't know, sir.

264
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,600
I heard you beat up Sung-woo.

265
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,890
[slurps]
Mm.

266
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,600
Good job.

267
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,690
You did good.

268
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,400
I was sick, you see.

269
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,110
I had problems breathing,
so I went to the medical corps,

270
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,650
but they couldn't find the cause.

271
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,150
The armed forces hospital couldn't either.

272
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,030
But they wouldn't let me go
to a hospital outside.

273
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,950
Meanwhile, Sung-woo was put in charge.

274
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,620
And he loves to drink and party.

275
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,580
Of course, everything's a mess.

276
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,960
You're right, sir.

277
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,630
Anyway, I'm different from him.
I do things in a new way.

278
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,000
From now on,
you just need to do as I say, okay?

279
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Yes, sir.

280
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,220
And don't get involved with those guys
in the barracks.

281
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,760
They've got nothing to do with us.

282
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,720
We just need to focus on our job.

Catching deserted soldiers.

284
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,100
Yes, sir.

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,230

Yes, sir.

292
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,700
[Beom-gu] His name is Choi Jun-mok.
He's been gone for two months.

293
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,750
I think he was abused in his unit,
but we're not sure how.

294
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,710
He was last spotted at a platform
in Incheon Station.

295
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,590
He tried to commit suicide there.

to catch deserters?

[mysterious music plays]

358
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,810
What do you think
that interception warrant is for?

359
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,810
I'm not sure, sir.

360

Normally…
[grunts]

361
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,780
you use it to check the access log
of online games or search engines.

362
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,870
Deserters tend to be hooked on video games

363
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,990
or hopeless romantics who have
to send emails to their girlfriends.

364
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,410
But in order to do that,
we need to visit each firm,

365
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
fill in an application, and wait for days.

366
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,420
And even if we get permission,
we need to access this site

367
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,170
and pay for each and every information.

368
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,920
Money makes the world go round.

369
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,390
Do you understand what I'm saying?

370
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,680
Yes, sir.

371
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,350
You don't need to understand.

372
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,390
I'm sorry, sir?

373
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,350
Listen to me, Private An.

374
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,520
What kind of a fool would use his own ID

375
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,190
after having deserted from the army?

376
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,940
They create new IDs
using other people's information.

377
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,990
Then what do you think we need to do
to find the deserter?

378
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Three, two, one.

379
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,160
-Well--
-Nope. Too late.

380
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,910
We need to meet his acquaintances.

381
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,880
[Ho-yeol] Family, girlfriend, friends,
and alumni. It doesn't matter who.

382
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,000
Anyone will do.

383
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,920
"He's been out of touch. We're not close.
I don't talk to him."

384
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,420
None of that matters.
Just question everyone.

385
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,260
Why do you think we should?

386
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,310
To predict what the deserter
might have done?

387
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,760
No. Wrong answer.

388
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,390
Deserters don't do the things
they normally do

389
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,310
or things that are predictable.

390
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,060
They intuitively know that it's dangerous.

391
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,860
Jun-ho, you must not like fish cakes.

392
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,570
Then is it the opposite?

393
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,990
To avoid being predictable?

394
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,040
Wrong again.

396
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,880
I thought you were smart.
What college do you go to?

397
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,960
[Jun-ho] I don't go to college.

Can you let go, sir?

402
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,400
What we should do is,
we should think in their shoes.

403
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,860
Find out what they'd want to eat,
who they'd want to see,

404
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,490
and what may be on their minds.

405
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,780
It's what Hollywood actors do.

406
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,120
It's called method acting.
Becoming one with the character.

407
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,040
Doesn't that just mean
we're starting from scratch?

408

Well, yes.

Not be disappointed.

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,850
I told you it's important
to get enough sleep.

There was nothing between us.

as his first love.

430
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,870
I guess he forgot to bring it.

431
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,950
In the army,
you're asked to write a journal.

432
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
It's like a diary.

433
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,460
And?

Oh, right. Hye-jeong. That's right.

441
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,180
He wrote tons of stuff about you
in his diary, Hye-jeong.

442
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,600
Right?

443
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,980
What did it say?

444
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,730
I didn't read it in detail.

445
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,450
But he wrote about how he fell for you
when you guys first met.

446
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,660
[Ho-yeol] He wrote that he can
never forget that moment.

You had jajangmyeon with him
at the orientation party, right?

Oh, right. And…

450
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,090
And he wrote that every moment
he spent with you

451
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,470
was very special to him.

452
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,010
[Ho-yeol] Yes, that's right.

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,300
-He wrote that about me?
-Yes.

Yes, Choi Jun-mok.

I haven't seen him in months.

471
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,360
Maybe he's started to lose faith.

It's coming from your jacket.

-I guess it's nicely fermented.
-It's probably rotten.

It's been 12 days.

He hasn't called yet.

with my first love in college.

and my nickname is Acorn Jelly."

Why "Acorn Jelly"?

533
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,620
Because of his name

534
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,920
and because he has no personality.

535
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,050
"That's right. I have no personality.
Please find me."

536
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,670
[dog barking tone from cell phone]

537
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,880
You're getting a call.

538
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,800
SERGEANT DOG

539
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,640
Communications Security,
Corporal Han Ho-yeol, sir.

540
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,940
[Beom-gu sighs]
Did you find anything?

541
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,770
We're working on it, sir.

542
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,690
That's your job, punk.
I'm asking if you made progress.

543
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,280
[Ho-yeol]
Well, we're gathering information, sir.

544
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,610
Are you kidding me?

545
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,410
I want updates!

546
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,740
Gosh, why is he yelling?

547
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,080
What did you say, you punk?

548
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,620
Ah.

549
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,630
Nothing, sir. We'll find him.

550
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,130
[Beom-gu groans] I received details on how
Choi Jun-mok was abused back in his unit.

551
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,390
Jun-mok snores pretty loudly
when he sleeps.

552
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,220
[snores]

553
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,220
[Beom-gu]They made him wear a gas mask
and didn't let him sleep.

554
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,770
[Jun-mok gasps, grunts]

555
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,100
[grumbles]

556
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,020
What a bunch of lunatics.

557
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,900
Anything else, sir?

558
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,200
Yes, he used his military debit card
to pay for a bowl of black bean noodles.

559
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,370
[Beom-gu] A restaurant called Ilpoomhyang
in Ilsan, at 11:30 p.m.

560
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,870
Don't bother to write it down.

561
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,750
[Beom-gu] If you're not getting anywhere,
just come back.

562
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,120
Yes, sir. Salute.

563
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,040
Is he asking us to return?

564
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,880
It means he'll kill us
if we go back empty-handed.

565
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,380
How much money do we have left?

566
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,510
We received 200,000 won,
and used it on food and transportation.

567
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,430
So now…

568
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,010
-[paper rustles]
-[coins chink]

569
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,230
[Jun-ho] We have 7,800 won left.

570
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,480
[scoffs]

571
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,440
I'll use my secret weapon.

572
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,860
24 HOUR SAUNA

573
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,990
[Ho-yeol]
Sir, we're traveling the country on foot.

574
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,150
And for some reason,

575
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,070
the ATM machine is broken,
so we can't withdraw any money.

576
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,530
If you let us in now,

577
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,660
we'll withdraw money and pay you
as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.

578
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,830
Where did you come from?

579
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,460
Pardon?

580
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,840
Where did you come from?
You said you're traveling on foot.

581
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,130
We just moved to the city from Yeongwol,
so we're not familiar with the names…

582
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,720
[scoffs]

583
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,010
Where in Yeongwol?

584
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,680
-[man] I'm from Yeongwol.
-A place called Deokpo…

585
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,850
I'm from Deokpo. Where in Deokpo?

586
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,560
It's near the Donggang River.

587
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,940
-What?
-Once you walk past the army unit there…

588
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,940
Oh, you mean the huge potato field
next to where people go rafting?

589
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,530
I'm the youngest son of that family.

590
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,320
-Oh, really?
-[chuckles]

591
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,780
I'm telling you this
because we're all past this now.

592
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,660
All the potatoes were ruined
because of that storm,

593
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,290
so we couldn't sell them.

594
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,790
My dad had a really tough time…

595
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,250
due to Typhoon Maemi.

596
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,170
What?

597
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,750
The typhoon from two years ago
was Bolaven.

598
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,010
My little brother…

599
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,260
injured his head
when Typhoon Bolaven hit our town.

600
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,140
[Ho-yeol] Sir.

601
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,480
We're traveling the country on foot,

602
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,100
and for some reason,
the ATM machine is broken…

603
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,400
If you could let us in,
we'll withdraw money and…

604
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,270
AN JUN-HO

605
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,200
Sleep later. If you sleep now,
you won't be able to sleep past midnight.

606
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,240
I'll sleep when I want to.

607
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,790
Okay, fine.

608
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,370
[sighs]

609
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,580
[Ho-yeol] You were so good earlier.

610
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,500
You should become an actor.

611
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,170
I should get your autograph.

612
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,010
Gosh, will you stop it already?

613
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,680
There you go!
[laughs]

614
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,060
-What will you do if I don't stop?
-[coughs]

615
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,770
What will you do?

616
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,110
-My gosh.
-I don't want to stop.

617
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,360
Damn it.

618
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,900
[Ho-yeol screams]

619
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,990
There you go!
[laughs]

620
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,530
There! There you go!

621
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,080
[dramatic music plays]

622
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,790
-Isn't it weird?
-What is?

623
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,130
Why did he go all the way
to Incheon Station to attempt suicide?

624
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,550
Because there are no screen doors there.

625
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,090
The two previous stations
don't have screen doors either.

626
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,300
Take a look at this.

627
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,060
Choi Jun-mok's friend saw him at the store
in Sangildong Station.

628
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,100
SANGILDONG STATION

629
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,230
[Jun-ho]
And the Chinese restaurant he went to…

630
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,400
[woman] This stop is the last stop.

631
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,980
[Jun-ho]
It's right in front of Daehwa Station.

632
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,610
The two stations…

633
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,160
They're both the very last stations.

634
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,530
He's a gourmet.

635
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,410
He must enjoy searching for good food.

636
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,330
Would you go searching for good food
in the middle of your suicide attempt?

637
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,960
Why would you even say that?

638
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Here's another thing that's weird.

639
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Choi Jun-mok was always spotted
late at night.

640
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,880
[Jun-ho] Incheon Station. 11:50 p.m.

641
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,430
Sangildong Station. 12:15 a.m.

642
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,300
Daehwa Station. 11:30 p.m.

643
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,850
He's only active at nighttime.

644
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,680
He's a vampire.

645
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,230
Gosh.

646
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,650
Then why don't you at least try to…

647
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,610
[clicks tongue]
Come here.

648
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,360
[keyboard clacks]

649
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,450
I checked all the websites he signed up on
before and after he joined the army.

650
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,990
Didn't you say this cost money?

651
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,410
Yes, Jun-mok's mother gave us money.

652
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,960
Anyway, I noticed
that he mostly used this as his ID.

653
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,010
[Ho-yeol] It's "Black" without a "C."

654
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,130
Choi Jun-mok's birthday is September 14.

655
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
[Ho-yeol] Yes.

656
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,550
But this ID had no login records.

657
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,060
So I just looked up "blakmagic."

658
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,890
And look. I got 470 results.

659
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,150
I checked every single ID

660
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,070
and compared all the personal information.

661
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,030
Look.

662
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,400
[Ho-yeol inhales deeply]

663
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,570
[exhales]

664
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,870
Doesn't this number look familiar?

665
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,410
[Jun-ho] Four, eight,

666
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,160
five, nine…

667
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,580
So you want me to contact you
if Jun-mok ever calls, right?

668
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,670
-Hye-jeong?
-[in English] Bingo.

669
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:32,340
[in Hangul] So you're saying he just
typed in 111 for no reason and used…

670
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,180
the number of that girl he liked
for the last four digits?

671
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,600
[sucks teeth]
I'm not so sure about that.

672
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,470
This is a better than guessing he went to
eat in the middle of his suicide attempt.

673
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,810
Do you think so?

674
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,560
[quirky music plays]

675
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,320
[snores]

676
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,080
[snoring continues]

677
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,790
[cell phone buzzes]

678
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,840
SLACKER

679
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,800
Seriously?

680
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,180
Communications Security,
Corporal Han Ho-yeol, sir!

681
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,640
Have you lost it, you punk?

682
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,140
No, sir.

683
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,890
-[Beom-gu] What is it?
-Oh, well…

684
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,020
We need another interception warrant.

685
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,940
An Jun-ho took it with him.

686
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,480
[Ho-yeol] No, not that one.
It's for someone else.

687
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,440
[Beom-gu sighs]

688
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,450
So you're saying Choi Jun-mok
created an ID

689
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,200
using his ex-girlfriend's phone number?

690
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,830
I mean, you think he might have?

691
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,080
[coughs]

692
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,370
That's right, sir.

693
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,330
-[Beom-gu] Do you have evidence?
-It's based on confidence, sir.

694
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,790
According to Jun-ho, at least.

695
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,090
[Beom-gu] It sounds like
you're talking out of your ass.

696
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,720
If this goes south, I'll get fired,
and you'll both be dead.

697
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,550
[grunts]

698
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,600
Yes, sir.
We'll just get dismissed with you, sir!

699
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,640
You asshole!

700
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,810
Private Heo Gi-yeong, sir.

701
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
[Beom-gu sighs]

702
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,190
[man singing on speaker]

703
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,690
Salute.

704
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,650
