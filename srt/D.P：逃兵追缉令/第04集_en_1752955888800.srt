They won't become convicts

183
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,360
or go to jail.

184
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,740
They'll just be sent somewhere else
as if nothing happened.

185
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,990
Excuse me.

186
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,370
You're high in rank, right?

187
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,330
Me?

188
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,120
Is this true?

189
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,920
We're carrying out
a thorough investigation.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,130
We're not sure about the trial yet.

191
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,260
Does that mean there might not be a trial?

192
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,390
That's just wrong!

193
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,930
Ma'am, the thing is…

194
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,180
He joined the army to protect the country,
but he was beaten and harassed.

195
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,140
That's why he deserted!

196
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,850
[Jun-mok] Mom, that's enough.

197
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,900
Why isn't anyone taking responsibility?

198
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,320
-[Jun-mok] Please, mom…
-[mother] Say something, will you?

199
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,700
[speaks Hangul]

200
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,330
Well…
[clicks tongue]

201
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,790
The military judge will hold the trial.

202
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
And the judge…

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,050
surely won't reach a verdict

204
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,220
merely for the interest of a certain unit

205
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,390
or personnel.

206
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,720
Nor should he be able to.

207
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,150
[mother] See? What did I tell you?

208
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,360
The world has changed.

209
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,490
It'll all work out.

210
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,950
My life's become a lot easier
thanks to you two.

211
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,790
I mean, we live in a different age.

212
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,330
The military police
need to be careful of human rights

213
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,590
and have to make sure
not to offend the soldiers.

214
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,750
This won't help us
develop strong soldiers.

215
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,590
It'll only weaken
the discipline of the military.

216
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,930
If a war breaks out, we won't have
what it takes to carry out a mission.

217
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,770
[commander sighs]

218
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,230
But our unit is different.

219
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,650
You two are doing a great job.

220
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,030
And it makes me feel very reassured.

221
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
And that guy who snores.

222
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,740
What was his name again, Captain Lim?

223
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,160
Ah. It's Private Choi Jun-mok.

224
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,490
[commander] Yes, Choi something.

225
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,290
We decided to keep things quiet

226
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,960
about what happened in his unit,
so keep that in mind.

227
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,830
But isn't the issue a bit too serious…

228
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,460
Right.

229
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,590
I heard the general there
is being promoted soon.

230
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,260
You taught me another lesson, sir.

231
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,810
Captain Lim.

232
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,940
Yes?

233
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,230
You really need to watch what you say.

234
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,440
Who do you think you are
to talk out of your ass like that?

235
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,660
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,370
A captain makes decisions
for the entire organization.

237
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,540
[commander] Do you understand?

238
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,830
-Yes, sir.
-[commander] Drink up.

239
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,420
-[alarm blares]
-[mysterious music plays]

240
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,430
[man] We were really startled too.

241
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,770
The guys searched the mountain all night
but couldn't find him.

242
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,400
Did you notice anything unusual?

243
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,530
Oh.

244
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,240
Our unit is directly controlled
by the army corps.

245
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,030
So it's very important
to keep things clean.

246
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,320
You know how it is.

247
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,740
We train them hard,
so they're too tired to bully anyone.

248
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,910
If anyone loses it,
they might shoot someone.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,330
He was a sergeant,
so no one really messed with him.

250
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,500
And he was picked as a model soldier
two times.

251
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,090
Were there any soldiers
who had issues with Sergeant Heo

252
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,130
or frequently got into arguments with him?

253
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,670
Right.

254
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,510
[comrade 1] Sergeant Heo…

255
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,260
still owes some money at the PX.

256
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,600
Chi-do really loved money.

257
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,770
He tore his shoulder muscle,
but he still insisted on rappelling.

258
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,560
"Rappel"?

259
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,360
We do helicopter rappel training
four times a year.

260
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,860
The soldiers get paid 155,000 won
for training as it's dangerous.

261
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,370
Gosh, I don't know where he spends
all his money.

262
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,290
We gathered our paychecks and made a bet.-

263
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,620
What kind of a bet?

264
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,000
[comrade 2] All sorts of stuff.

265
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,090
Soccer. Yut. Guessing who'd come
first place in The Music Trend.

266
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,250
The medical officer warned Chi-do

267
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,180
that he could severely hurt his arm
if he rappelled.

268
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,390
[Chi-do's captain chuckle]
But this is what he said.

269
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,850
"What's the probability of that?"

270
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,850
Sergeant Heo was the one
who started the bets.

271
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,140
And he always took everything.

272
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,060
What do you mean?

273
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,190
Oh, well…

274
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,950
Sergeant Heo never lost a bet.

275
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,490
[comrade 1] Sergeant Heo,
are you a professional gambler?

276
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,330
By any chance,
is your father Heo Yeong-man?

277
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,250
-"The hand is faster than the eye."
-[comrade 2 sighs]

278
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,590
I always keep a close watch,
but you always win.

279
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,550
I told you we should stop earlier.

280
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,090
How did you get four of a kind?

281
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,850
[comrade 2 sighs]

282
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,850
Hey.

283
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,310
You can never beat me.

284
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,060
Do you know why?

285
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,820
Look.

286
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,110
There are three doors.

287
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,780
[Chi-do] If you open the right door,

288
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,700
you get a six-day leave.

289
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,030
Yeong-sik, pick a door.

290
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,370
Okay. Yeong-sik picked door number one.

291
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,340
But then, he finds out
that door number three isn't it.

292
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,380
Then let me ask you one more time.

293
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,800
Yeong-sik, will you stick
with door number one?

294
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,390
Or will you switch to door number two?

295
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,610
I'll just stick with the first one.
I don't want to switch.

296
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,730
Why not?

297
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,610
Because I might trick you?

298
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,280
Or because you don't want to switch
to the wrong door?

299
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,200
Gosh, either way, it's a 50-50 chance.

300
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
It's one or the other.

301
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,370
[Chi-do] Do you think so?

302
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,450
[deep inhale]
Okay. Here's the answer.

303
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,120
[soldiers shout]

304
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,460
[soldiers speak Hangul]

305
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,380
[Ho-yeol]
They do that just for 150,000 won?

306
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
[Jun-ho] Of course.

307
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,220
My monthly pay is 122,500 won.

308
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,340
I would never.

309
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,390
Even if they paid me 468,000 won.

310
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,350
Never.

311
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,730
So he used all that money
he worked so hard to save up

312
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,190
and just vanished.

313
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,520
"Vanished"?

314
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,860
Yes, he just took off.

315
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,690
You'd have to be crazy to run away
when you're in the middle of nowhere.

316
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,160
But he seems to be quite rational
from what we heard.

317
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,160
No.

318
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,120
I wouldn't say he's rational.
There's something about him.

319
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,040
He was pretty determined too.

320
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,250
What do you mean?

321
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay, listen. Jeong Hyeon-min
went on leave

322
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,380
and didn't return out of impulse

323
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,880
because he was having fun
playing games and drinking.

324
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,800
But this guy was determined enough

325
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,600
to climb over a barbed wire fence
even if it tore his flesh.

326
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,390
[Ho-yeol] That's what I think.

327
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,230
-[mysterious music plays]
-[soldiers chanting]

328
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,730
[Ho-yeol] He was determined to climb down
a mountain to run away.

329
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,570
STOP THE REDEVELOPMENT

330
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,240
He was even determined

331
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,070
to steal clothes
from a civilian household.

332
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,530
[in English] Okay?

333
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,500
[in Hangul] People as determined
as Heo Chi-do run away with a purpose.

334
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,920
A very clear one at that.

335
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,250
Like what?

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,170
Mm.
[sucks teeth]

337
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,300
Let's ask.

338
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,630
[woman 1] Who are you?

339
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,850
Oh, hello. We're the military police.

340
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,890
[Ho-yeol] Is this Mr. Heo Chi-do's house?

341
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,190
Heo who?

342
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,320
Ah.

343
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,490
[door opens]

344
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,160
This is probably it. Heo Chi-do, right?

345
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,030
This place is registered
under his grandmother's name.

346
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,620
Gosh, she really should move.
It's dangerous here.

347
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,500
Ma'am.

348
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,040
[Ho-yeol] Gosh, I guess he was
raised by his grandmother.

349
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,130
[woman 1] Ma'am.

350
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Goodness. Did you wet your pants again?

351
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,180
Is it spring?

352
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,470
Did the flowers bloom?

353
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,640
[woman 1] Goodness.

354
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,100
No, it's okay. Don't.

355
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,560
It's okay.

356

But when you find out one of them is wrong

Sergeant Heo Chi-do…

532
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,300
"Economics…"

533
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,720
[footsteps approaching]

534
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,220
[Jun-ho scoffs]

535
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,930
[Jang-soo] Hey, Nerd.

536
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
Private Cho Suk-bong, sir.

537
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,440
Okay, sir.

538
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,030
[door opens, closes]

539
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,280
[Suk-bong] Hey, Jun-ho.

540
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,240
[Jun-ho] Sir.

541
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,670
I'm sorry, sir.

542
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,500
I forgot to get what you asked for.

543
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,630
No, it's okay. I understand.

544
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,840
Wait a second.

545
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,260
Hey, newbie.

546
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,510
Private Kang Byeong-su, sir!

547
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,390
[Byeong-su grunts]

548
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,600
Private Kang Byeong-su, sir!

549
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,360
I want all my juniors and your seniors
behind the barracks.

550
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,780
[Byeong-su] Yes, sir!

551
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,570
[coughs]
Jeez.

552
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,120
Private Cho, what's going on?

553
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,080
[Suk-bong] Stand up straight, fuckers.

554
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,910
Those who joined in December.

555
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,170
Private Kang Byeong-su, sir!

556
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
Private Shin Gwang-seop, sir!

557
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,340
Private Jeon Eun-seok, sir!

558
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,420
[Suk-bong] Do you know who he is?

559
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,470
[soldiers]
I'm sorry, sir! I'm not sure, sir!

560
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,050

561
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,600

[Hyeon-min grunts]

564
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,730
I'm okay, sir.

565
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,520
You bastards.
What have you taught your juniors?

566
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
How could the recruits
not know the name of their senior?

567
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,110
Have you lost your fucking minds?

568
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,400
[both] I'm sorry, sir!

569
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,950
We won't make the same mistake again!

570
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,490
[Suk-bong] You should say something.

571
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,200
[Jun-ho] New recruits.

572
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,670
-Private Shin Gwang-seop, sir!
-Private Jeon Eun-seok, sir!

573
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,880
Get up.

574
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,750
[sand rumbles]

575
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,510
[Jun-ho] Brush the dirt off your hands.

576
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,970
Hyeon-min and Jeong-in.

577
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,800
You should do better.

578
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,220
[Hyeon-min and Jeong-in] Yes, sir.

579
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,230
[Jun-ho] Understand your seniors
just want the best for you guys.

580
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,440
Go back inside.

581
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,280
What are you doing?

582
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,820
[Jun-ho] I'm sorry, sir.

583
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,580
But we also got beaten up a lot.

584
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,410
So let's stop this…

585
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,920
You didn't even get beat up that much!
You were never here since you're a D.P.

586
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,380
[Sung-bok breathes heavily]

587
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,710
I'm sorry, sir.

588
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,920
But still…

[soldier grunts]

590
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,430
Private Kang Byeong-su, sir.

591
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,510
Gosh, I'm getting discharged soon,
so I wasn't going to get involved.

592
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,640
-Front leaning rest position, Nerd.
-Private Cho Suk-bong, sir.

593
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,850
[Jang-soo] You asshole…

594
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,230
Should you be so strict
to someone fresh out of the boot?

595
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,360
No, sir.

596
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,280
-Sergeant Hwang, please stop--
-Who let you talk? You're just a private.

597
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,700
Are we playing soldiers here?

598
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,370
-Hey, newbie. Stand here.
-Private Kang Byeong-su, sir.

599
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,160
[soldier] Hurry up, you punk.

600
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,210
Jun-ho.

601
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,880
Private An Jun-ho, sir.

602
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,250
[Jang-soo] Hit him.

603
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,670

Jun-ho.

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,520
Private An Jun-ho, sir.

607
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Hit him.

608
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,360
[grunting]
Private Kang Byeong-su, sir.

609
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,610
[Jang-soo] Jun-ho.

-[sniffles]
-[Byeong-su pants]

611
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,530
Do you think I'll stop if you don't do it?

612
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,830
[shaky breath]

613
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,910
[Jang-soo] Hit him.

[ominous music plays]

615
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,170
Gosh, you guys are so loud.
What's with all this ruckus?

616
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,130
There's your fucking boyfriend.

617
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,720
[Jang-soo speaks Hangul]

618
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,140
You prick. You have no damn respect
for your damn seniors.

619
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,180
-[Ho-yeol] Follow me.
-[Jun-ho] Corporal Han, wait…

620
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,270
-Corporal Han, we were just--
-Shut up, okay?

621
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,400
-Come here.
-Corporal Han.

[door creaks, closes]

624
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,440
Corporal Han, sir. What's gotten into you?

625
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,490
I just…

626
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,870
Are your seniors

627
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,790
some kind of a joke to you, you punk?

628
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,540
You asshole! I can't believe this!

629
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,170
Stand up straight.
Clench your teeth! You punk! Shut up!

630
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,130
What did you do wrong? Tell me, you punk!

631
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,920
[grunts]

632
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,300
[Jun-ho] I'm sorry, sir!

633
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,380
I'm sorry, sir!

[Jun-ho yelps]

635
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,890
Let's stop here.
[laughs]

636
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,980
Corporal Han is killing him in there.

637
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,690
I guess that asshole still wants respect
even though he's hardly here.

638
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,230
[soldier chuckles]

639
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,070
Let's go sleep.

640
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,150
Gosh, that startled me.

641
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,620
I think they're gone.

[sighs]
Jun-ho.

644
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,590
Stop getting yourself in trouble here.

645
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,300
If you keep this up, they'll harass you
even after Jang-soo is discharged.

646
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,220
I'm sorry, sir.

647
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,810
[Ho-yeol] Don't be. You did nothing wrong.

648
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,520
What's the point of bringing back
all those deserters?

649
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,560
All that bullshit exists even here.

650
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,690
[clicks tongue]
I totally get why they desert.

651
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,070
What are you doing?

652
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,110
Just a second, sir.

653
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,280
[sighs]
You're like Sherlock.

654
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,120
[Ho-yeol] What are you trying
to investigate this time?

655
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,410
[scribbles]

656
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,960
[soft percussive music plays]

657
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,260
His first choice was to quit college
and join the army.

658
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,300
"Hey, Mr. Heo.

659
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,770
You abandoned your grandmother
by joining the army, right?"

660
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,810
[Jun-ho] If he abandoned his grandmother,

661
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,730
he wouldn't have had to worry about
making the wrong choice.

662
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,240
-You're right.
-But…

663
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,990
what if he was trying
to protect his grandmother?

664
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,580
Ah.

665
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,200
[Ho-yeol] So was the variable
his grandmother's dementia?

666
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,710
No, he joined the army
after she got dementia.

667
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,130
Okay.

668
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,050
What if the variable…

669
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,340
was the demolition of his house?

670
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,180
[Jun-ho] Okay. One.

671
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,100
He joined the army
to protect his grandmother. Two.

672
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,690
He suddenly found out his house
was going to be demolished.

673
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,730
Three.

674
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,860
So maybe he abandoned the army

675
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,360
and chose to go to a place

676
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,870
that would give him a better chance
at protecting his grandmother.

677
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,080
[scoffs]

678
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,950
-Desertion.
-Desertion.

679
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,870
Wait a minute.

680
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,960
Heo Chi-do called us.

681
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,960
How did he know who we were?

682
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,760

-What? What is it?
-[sighs]

686
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,020
I can't believe I missed that.

687
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,650
You damn perverts.

688
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,110
-Private An Jun-ho, sir.
-Corporal Han Ho-yeol, sir.

689
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,030
How long has it been
since they've returned?

690
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,740
-It's been 14 hours and 25 minutes, sir.
-Did you hear that?

691
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,740
It's only been that long.

692
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,080
We found a way…

693
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,580
to bring Heo Chi-do back.

694
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,420
Was it Jun-ho's idea again?

695
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,540
Are you sure?

696
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,090
We're extremely enthusiastic.

697
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Gosh, my damn gallbladder hurt just now.
I think I have gallstones.

698
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,050
I think…

699
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,010
we have more than
a 50 percent probability.

700
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,140

I'll kill you only 50 percent then.
