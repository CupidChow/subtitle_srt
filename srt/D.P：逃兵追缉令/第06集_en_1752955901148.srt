Private Cho Suk-bong, sir.

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,600
[Beom-gu]
You played judo until middle school.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,900
-You also competed nationally, too.
-[Suk-bong] Yes, sir.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,650
Why did you quit?

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,490
[Suk-bong] Well…

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,030
I just wasn't comfortable
with hurting people.

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,540
Gosh, your life here is going to be tough.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,870
How did you become a special warrior?

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,710
[Suk-bong]
I just happened to have passed the test.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,630
So, it just happened? Is that it?

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,840
Good.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,600
But don't try too hard.
It won't do you any good.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,600
-[Suk-bong] Pardon, sir?
-Never mind.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,810
It may sound like a million years away,

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,070
but what do you want to do
after you finish your service?

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,410
Well, I'll probably just draw comics

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,950
and teach kids.

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,460
That's what I want to do.

23

[girl] My gosh, seriously, Mr. Bongdhi.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,130
I've already messed it up.
There's nothing you can do.

25
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,420
Seon-a, you still need to try
and do something about it

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,880
to make a difference.

27

He pulled a knife on him.

179
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,420
Are you disobeying me?

180
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,300
Why don't we stick to our initial plan

181
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,640
and leave it to Sergeant Park
and the D.P. to take care of this?

182
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,310
Or why don't we let the police--

[Ji-seop sighs]

184

You're disobeying me.

185
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,900
If we were at war,
you would have been convicted.

186
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,820
Are you worried
you might be held responsible?

187
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,650

Sir, you don't have to do this.

190
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,950
I'll do what I can to make sure
things don't get out of hand.

You're starting to sound like Beom-gu.

Gi-yeong isn't picking up.
Do you think Lim Ji-seop is stopping him?

201
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,750
What should we do?

Hello?

205
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,430
[Ji-seop] Gi-yeong is busy working.

206
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,850
He's trying to trace
Suk-bong and Jang-soo's location.

208

[Beum-go] What's going on?
Why are you helping?

209
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,730
Because this is going
to keep bothering me.

210
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,400
[Ji-seop] The police and the SDT
are on their way, so you need to hurry.

211
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,450
Should I be thanking you?

212
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,910
This is the best I can do.

213
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,330
[Ji-seop] Just find him.

214
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,330
Let's go.

215
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,630
-What are you looking at?
-No, it's just…

216
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm just worried
if you're going to be okay.

217
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,510
Obviously not.

218
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,270
I'm only doing it
so things won't get worse.

Where are we, you bastard?

224
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,460
You're making a mistake.

225
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,460
How are you going to deal
with the consequences?

226

Come on.

Do you think we'll be able
to catch Suk-bong?

240
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
We have to.

241
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,850

This is Gangwon Province.

242
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,980
[Beom-gu] It's okay. Just keep driving.

I didn't know
a place like this still existed.

Never mind. This is the place. Let's go.
