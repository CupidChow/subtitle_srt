1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:05,013
DARE TO LOVE ME

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:07,420
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,239
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,807
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

5
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,121
How did I get home?

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,753
Yoon-bok!

7
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,925
Where am I?

8
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:55,181
There is an orange glow on your face.

9
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,683
My face?

10
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,894
I'll go get you something to drink.

11
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,187
Wait here, okay?

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,067
Are youâ€¦

13
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,904
abandoning me?

14
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,366
How imprudent of me.

15
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:18,204
I have committed

16
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,291
a great offense to Master Kim.

17
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:29,883
Yoon-bok!

18
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,408
I must ask her for forgiveness.

19
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,609
EPISODE 4
GETTING CLOSER, LITTLE BY LITTLE

20
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,281
You've got spoon worms for lips.
They're so red.

21
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,492
Oh, wait.

22
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,869
Should we go for spoon worms?

23
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,789
Never mind.

24
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,624
He's probably had some before.

25
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,459
Are you getting spoon worms?

26
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,086
I love them too, you know?

27
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,629
I'll be home late!

28
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:54,676
Are you really getting
spoon worms without me?

29
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,928
You're crossing a line!

30
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,182
Hey, Yoon-bok.

31
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,061
Did you sleep well, Master?

32
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,813
Yeah. How about you?

33
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,231
I did too.

34
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,317
I apologize for my imprudence last night.

35
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:12,819
No worries.

36
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,654
Are you ready to head out?

37
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:15,655
Sorry?

38
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,198
What?

39
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,660
Do you have plans
for the weekend, Yoon-bok?

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,079
No, nothing special.

41
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,622
Really? In that case,

42
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,667
do you want to go on a city tour with me?

43
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,378
- City tour?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:36,384
It's Kim Hong-do's special treat
for her disheartened pupil Shin Yoon-bok!

45
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,970
- Yes, I will go.
- Really?

46
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,346
- Is that a promise?
- Yes.

47
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,808
Oh dear. Are you okay?

48
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,728
Do you have a bad hangover?

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,605
You must feel horrible.

50
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,523
Then we don't have to go.

51
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,777
We can go some other time.

52
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,534
No, Master. I simply overslept.

53
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,455
Could you wait a moment while I get ready?

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,500
Will you be all right?

55
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,503
Yes. I shall be ready in a moment.

56
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,548
Okay, take your time.

57
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,024
Again? All right!

58
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,817
That was so much fun, Yoon-bok!

59
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,068
Yoon-bok.

60
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,237
Yoon-bok?

61
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,536
Oh my.

62
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,709
Thank you.

63
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,046
You're amazing at this.

64
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,381
You're like a pro.

65
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,551
I would like to dedicate
this honor to you, Master.

66
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,430
Really?

67
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,642
Thank you, Yoon-bok.

68
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,564
Look at this.

69
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,196
Here.

70
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,115
Thank you.

71
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,492
ICE ROOM

72
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,750
RED CLAY SAUNA

73
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,931
This dish resembles a volcano.

74
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,017
The lava may start flowing from it.

75
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,187
When can we start eating?

76
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,022
Wait for it.

77
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:42,236
Take some meat,
water parsley, and bean sprouts

78
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,780
and eat them all together.

79
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,073
- Here.
- Thank you.

80
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,297
Oh no. Are you okay?

81
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,256
Is it too spicy?

82
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:04,592
It is delicious.

83
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,219
Your face is so red.

84
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,347
I didn't know you couldn't eat spicy food.

85
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:20,441
I did not think I could not eat anymore

86
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,527
after the pork rib stew,

87
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,447
but this soft serve goes down so smoothly.

88
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,325
It's the sweet and salty rule.

89
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,496
Once you eat something salty,
you're bound to crave something sweet.

90
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,542
The sweet and salty rule?

91
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,168
It's just like life.

92
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:43,381
Once the days full of salty tears
and runny noses pass by,

93
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,678
you're bound to come across
a sweet day just like this.

94
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,307
Master,

95
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:57,144
how is it that you have
such interesting insights?

96
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,146
You're flattering me.

97
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:04,694
Everything I experienced today
with you was a first for me.

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,948
My heart has been heavy
obsessing over ancient objects

99
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,825
and events of the past.

100
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,123
But I feel a weight has been lifted
after today's experiences.

101
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,461
I am happiest when I am with you, Master.

102
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,841
I feel the same.

103
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,514
Thanks to you, I had such a great time.

104
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,480
- Let's go.
- Where?

105
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,399
The last stop on our tour.

106
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:44,901
Follow me.

107
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:46,986
Master!

108
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,204
Look over there.

109
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,463
The sunsets here are unbelievable.

110
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,911
Thank you for today, Master.

111
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,331
I should thank you.

112
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,793
Call me if you want to hang out again.

113
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,712
Oh, right.

114
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,047
You don't have my number.

115
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,633
So we can stay in contact.

116
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,302
I must refuse.

117
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,096
I could not dream

118
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,099
of exchanging phone numbers
and becoming friends with my master.

119
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,604
Give me your phone.

120
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:06,357
You don't have to give me yours.
Just take my number.

121
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,152
Here.

122
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:14,657
Call me.

123
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,745
Thank you.

124
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:27,795
I'll go now.

125
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,714
Bye.

126
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,185
Hello?

127
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,396
<i>Master.</i>

128
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,697
If you are ever down
or would like to get fresh airâ€¦

129
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,577
call me at any time.

130
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,887
SHIN YOON-BOK

131
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,099
How cute.

132
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,822
Come in, Yoon-bok.

133
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,743
I cannot enter
such an intimate space withâ€¦

134
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,249
I shall enter.

135
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,835
- Look at the camera, okay?
- Camera?

136
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,003
Here's the timer.

137
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,967
Come closer, Yoon-bok.

138
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,594
Okay.

139
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,222
Hurry, time's running out!

140
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,731
I am happiest when I am with you, Master.

141
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,944
"When I am with you"?

142
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,864
With me?

143
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,660
Oh my god!

144
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,563
Look at these dark circles.

145
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,234
Did I go overboard yesterday?

146
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,908
Yoon-bok had fun, so it's all worth it.

147
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,298
Administrator Lee asked

148
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,050
if you'd accept Panmunjom
over Seongsan Village.

149
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,803
Is he a fool or what?

150
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,848
How does he still not understand
what I want?

151
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,182
Should we prepare a plan B?

152
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,476
No, it's go big or go home.

153
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,270
I will only accept plan A.

154
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:45,868
Hello.

155
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,211
I see you have fallen in love,
Hong-do Kim.

156
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,630
- Pardon me?
- With work.

157
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,427
I can't wait to see
how your keychain concept

158
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,512
will be transformed into fashion.

159
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,225
I passionately support your love!

160
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,018
Thank you, ma'am!

161
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,901
You go, girl.

162
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,763
A death caused 17 years ago?

163
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,891
An item my father had
at the time of his death

164
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,142
has been found recently.

165
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,313
I fear that whoever took it
from him sought to harm him.

166
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,649
Perhaps he was a victim

167
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,610
not only of the fire but also of a crime.

168
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,321
The records don't show
any signs of murder.

169
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,782
However, he did have a few bruises.

170
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,744
Do you think someoneâ€¦

171
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:12,913
They weren't fatal.

172
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,708
As victims of fire
are often severely damaged,

173
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,919
all I can say is that
no signs of murder were discovered.

174
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,395
WOORIM

175
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,692
My lord!

176
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,238
He had a burn on his arm.

177
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,492
Shall I drive you home, Young Master?

178
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,535
No.

179
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,956
I have made posts on various travel forums

180
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,916
so we should receive word soon.

181
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,544
How can I not recall anything

182
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,715
when I was at the scene that night?

183
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,810
How could I remember
what happened 17 years ago?

184
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,646
Did you notice anything strange?

185
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,648
Anything strange?

186
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,027
Haven't you read the case report?

187
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,906
There were no signs of arson.
It was just as written.

188
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,574
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,470
INSPECTOR PARK

190
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,931
Yes, Inspector Park?

191
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,350
<i>I found it, Young Master.</i>

192
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,979
<i>One of my sources is an antique dealer</i>

193
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,982
<i>who was offered an incense burner
Phony had previously stolen.</i>

194
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,818
<i>I checked just in case</i>

195
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,779
<i>and the seller looks similar
to one of the club thugs.</i>

196
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,952
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,583
You're wasting your time.

198
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,710
I guarantee it's authentic.

199
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,923
Could you be any slower?

200
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,174
Don't buy it then!

201
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,803
Why are you so impatient, young man?

202
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,763
I'm telling you it's real!

203
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,724
Hello.

204
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,273
You bastard.

205
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,401
Don't come any closer.

206
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,570
One more step and I'll stab him.

207
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,738
Drop the knife.
You have no way out anyway.

208
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,282
Screw you.

209
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,911
You're going to regret that!

210
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,310
Damn it.

211
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,190
That fan looks familiar.

212
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,484
You once said
you let your fists do the talking

213
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,277
but would never steal.

214
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,740
Jeez, look at your nose bleeding.

215
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,283
I told you you'd regret it.

216
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm very sorry.

217
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,081
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

218
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,082
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

219
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,834
Of course it does.

220
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,878
All I did was stand watch.

221
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,172
<i>Who ordered you to stand watch?</i>

222
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:54,426
If I knew who they were,
I wouldn't be alive.

223
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,012
So they get rid of anyone
who knows their identity?

224
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,138
That's right.

225
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,433
And you had the guts
to steal from someone like them?

226
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,186
Well, thanks to you pigsâ€¦

227
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,856
I mean officers,
the deal fell through anyway.

228
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,025
Oh, "the deal"?

229
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,277
What deal?

230
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,241
You better start talking, you punk.

231
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,700
The thing is,

232
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,789
we had agreed to take the item
to the meeting point for the deal.

233
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,082
Meeting point?

234
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,500
Where's that?

235
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,047
Meeting point?

236
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,346
SEONGSANGWAN

237
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,433
<i>Could it be?</i>

238
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,812
<i>Is Seongsangwan connected to the case?</i>

239
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,024
He's from Seongsan Village, isn't he?

240
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,958
NOW HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES
TO JOIN US AT SEONGSANGWAN

241
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,376
Inspector Park,

242
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,130
Let us plant an insider here.

243
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,175
Are you thinking
of an undercover operation?

244
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,681
I'll get on it.

245
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,728
SEONGSANGWAN

246
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,854
Just end it?

247
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,148
All of a sudden?

248
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,567
<i>Your views are low
and you're getting a lot of hate comments.</i>

249
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,360
<i>I think it's best to end the series.</i>

250
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,748
Ms. Bodyguard?

251
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,891
- What are you doing?
- Ms. Bodyguard!

252
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,852
Were you taking my phone number?

253
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,188
There's something
I really want to ask you.

254
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,483
Don't even bother to ask it.

255
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,193
Leave.

256
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,738
Oh, come on.

257
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,619
I'll call you!

258
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,633
Open the gate!

259
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,331
- Do you know Seongsan Village?
- Yes.

260
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:06,084
You'll find a man
named Shin Su-keun there.

261
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,253
Deliver this to him.

262
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,295
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:11,089
Wait.

264
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:14,801
- But Seongsan Village--
- Is hard to get into, yes.

265
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,887
But I want you
to do everything you can to get in.

266
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,682
I despise the impossible.

267
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:23,810
No matter what happens,

268
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:27,647
this gift must be delivered
to him in person, all right?

269
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:30,775
Understood.

270
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,653
HOW TO GET PAST SEONGSAN GATE

271
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,697
SEONGSAN VILLAGE IS NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

272
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,241
What do I do?

273
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,791
Maybe I could ask Yoon-bok.

274
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:50,545
I have his phone number, don't I?

275
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:53,882
<i>The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.</i>

276
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,676
- Oh, it's turned off. He must be busy.
<i>- You will be redirected toâ€¦</i>

277
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,346
What do I do?

278
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:08,730
My goodness.

279
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:11,316
I failed to go see Master Kim
before leaving.

If you accept their offer,
they'll pay for your education

Greetings.

303
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:11,741
Good work, everyone.

304
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,701
- Thank you, my lord.
- Good.

305
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:30,301
What on earth is he doing in his room?

306
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:31,886
Goodness!

307
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:35,806
Are you out of your mind?

308
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,601
The village is teeming with people.

309
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:42,480
Didn't I tell you not to take a step
out of your room?

310
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:44,524
I even gave you food and a chamber pot.

311
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:47,818
You shouldn't be out and about.
What if someone sees you?

312
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:52,114
I made sure no one was outside
before I came in.

313
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:58,162
Just go back to your room.

314
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,373
Lady Yeoju.

315
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:02,667
You saw me last night,

316
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,585
didn't you?

317
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,005
Me?

318
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,174
You saw me, didn't you?

319
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,892
I have no idea what you're talking about.

320
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:23,980
Mom.

321
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:30,528
- Mom.
- Hey there, son.

322
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,446
What brings you here?

323
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,740
Is someone inside? I heard voices.

324
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:37,034
No, that's ridiculous.

325
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:41,038
You must be so hungry
that you're hearing things.

326
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:42,790
I swear I heard someone.

327
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,750
- No, you didn't.
- Lady Yeoju!

328
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:47,461
- Goodness.
- Jun-ho.

329
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:52,967
Were you watching
online videos again, Lady Yeoju?

330
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:57,555
Did I not give you wireless earphones

331
00:29:58,306 --> 00:30:00,558
so Grandfather
would not scold you for the noise?

332
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:02,810
You're right, Young Master.

333
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:06,397
I just keep forgetting to use them.

334
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,069
It's gracious of you to give gifts
to the common folk, Young Master.

335
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,238
How dare you?

336
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,157
My apologies, Young Master.

337
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,325
Mom.

338
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,453
Please enjoy your stay, Jun-ho.

339
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:35,801
How long are you going to live like this?

340
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,720
Come live with me away from here.

341
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,306
What I do might look lowly to you,

342
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:43,643
but I'm very proud
to uphold our tradition.

343
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,646
You better watch your behavior
in the outside world.

344
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:48,814
Don't tarnish our village's reputation.

345
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,650
What did this village ever do for me?

346
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:52,902
Someone else helped me
from being treated like an animal.

347
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,863
But you don't even know who they are.

348
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:59,200
Keep taking money from a stranger
and you might end up in trouble.

349
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:03,079
If it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't be my own boss.

350
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:07,541
I'd still be treated like a servant.
Am I wrong?

351
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:09,627
So Mom,

352
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:15,549
come live with me so you can be
treated the way you deserve.

353
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:18,177
Nonsense! Enough with the crazy talk.

354
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:20,846
Just carry this for me.

355
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:22,973
There's so much to do.

356
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:25,643
Mom!

357
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,561
Hurry up!

358
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,237
- Here.
- Is this it?

359
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,154
Yes.

360
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:39,365
Take your time with it.

361
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:41,033
Thank you.

362
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:08,728
Iâ€¦

363
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,188

00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:26,912
Thank you.

367
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:38,340
- You guys look so pretty!
- How pretty!

368
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:40,468
One more time!

369
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:42,553
Cheese!

370
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:46,849
Let's take one over there.

371
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:50,770
SEONGSAN GATE

372
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:56,692
How pretty.

373
00:32:58,027 --> 00:32:59,403
What a good day.

374
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:12,458
Stop right there.

375
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:17,505
Hello.

376
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:19,965
To introduce myself,

377
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:23,594
my name is Kim Hong-do.

378
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:26,889
I came from Seoul to deliver something
to some man named Shin Su-keun.

379
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,140
"Some man"?

380
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,059
It's this.

381
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,978
I absolutely need to
give this to him in person,

382
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:35,189
so could you let me in for a short moment?

383
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:36,315
No.

384
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:40,569
I'll just hand this to him
and be out before you know it.

385
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:41,862
I said no.

386
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,991
Or maybe you could have him come out here?

387
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:47,660
Leave immediately.

388
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:51,080
Please, sir. Just this once.

389
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,414
Leave!

390
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:55,334
If you refuse,
you will be forced out of the square.

391
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,050
What do I do?

392
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:06,720
SEONGSAN VILLAGE
HANBOK RENTAL

393
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:16,146
Which family are you a member of?

394
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,440
I am the eldest daughter of Lord Kim.

395
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:20,943
Please open the gate.

396
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:23,654
Lord Kimâ€¦

397
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:26,156
Oh, Lord Kim?

398
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,036
I know his eldest daughter very well.

399
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,371
Please show your face.

400
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:36,000
How rude of you!

401
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,586
How dare you try
to see the face of a lady?

402
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:40,129
Unless you seek to be punished,

403
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:43,090
cease your harassment
and open the gate now!

404
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:45,676
My goodness.

405
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,553
You watched too much TV.

406
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,182
It's not the olden days anymore.
Women don't cover their faces now!

407
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,059
Unless you're hiding something that is.

408
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,562
My goodness!

409
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:59,982
You're a sly one, aren't you?

410
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:01,525
Guards!

411
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,737
Escort this criminal
out of the square immediately!

412
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,655
Sir?

413
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,490
I'm sorry. Please don't do this!

414
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:11,702
Please, sir!

415
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:13,787
Stop!

416
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:20,127
- Yoon-bok!
- Let go of her immediately.

417
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:22,296
Goodness.

418
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,384
Are you all right, Master?

419
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:28,969
Yeah, I'm fine.

420
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:34,391
What brings you all the way here?

421
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:36,727
Well, it has to do with work.

422
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:41,273
I need to deliver something
to a man named Shin Su-keun.

423
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:46,236
Do you mean Lord Shin Su-keun?

424
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,237
Yeah.

425
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,206
Open the gate.

426
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,418
I cannot allow a stranger
through the gate, Young Master.

427
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:03,003
I know her very well.

428
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:07,341
I will bear all the consequences,
so open the gate.

429
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:08,884
I shall take her to him.

430
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,273
Let us go in.

431
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,777
Thanks, Yoon-bok.

432
00:36:27,861 --> 00:36:30,114
Thank you.

433
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:31,740
Thank you.

434
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:43,085
As service here is nearly unavailable,

435
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,629
I did not realize you had contacted me.

436
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:47,881
My apologies.

437
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:50,009
Don't apologize.
I'm actually very grateful.

438
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:51,802
You got me in.

439
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:56,515
It's as if time stood still here.

440
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,145
- Let us go.
- Okay.

441
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:11,321
Hello.

442
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:15,784
What's that?

443
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,744
Oh, that.

444
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:20,956
They're so pretty.

445
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:44,855
This pavilion is more than 300 years old

446
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:47,232
and provides shelter
for everyone in the village.

447
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:49,902
300 years old? That's amazing.

448
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:51,653
This way.

449
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,665
Kong Qiu said.

450
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,250
- "Kong Qiu said."
- "Kong Qiu said."

451
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:06,794
Be strict with yourself.

452
00:38:06,877 --> 00:38:08,545
- "Be strict with yourself."
- "Be strict with yourself."

453
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:10,047
Be lenient with others.

454
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,840
- "Be lenient with others."
- "Be lenient with others."

455
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:15,135
This institution was founded 200 years ago

456
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,678
and is also my alma mater.

457
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:18,722
It's a school?

458
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,391
That's so cool.

459
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:23,852
- This way, please.
- Okay.

460
00:38:28,315 --> 00:38:30,025
You won't believe this!

461
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,946
What are you two fussing about?

462
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:36,198
It's about Young Master Yoon-bok.

463
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,283
He's here with a lady!

464
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,494
- What?
- Is she pretty?

465
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:42,955
Greetings, Lady Se-ryung.

466
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,460
I asked whether the lady was pretty.

467
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,588
I would say she is more pleasant

468
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,215
than pretty.

469
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,635
But something about her

470
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:59,972
is as peculiar as the fog
that covers the peak of Seongsan.

471
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:03,308
What were they doing together?

472
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:06,478
They were walking toward Woorim Residence.

473
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:07,980
I see.

474
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:09,731
Is not the Shin family
holding a memorial today?

475
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,942
Their whole family
will be gathering together.

476
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,944
Could it be?

477
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,988
Will he introduce her?

478
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:17,865
- What?
- Oh my.

479
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,909
The Shin family
is going to have a lot to celebrate.

480
00:39:20,993 --> 00:39:22,286
Celebrate what?

481
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:25,747
Young Master Yoon-bok has been
promised to a lady since childhood.

482
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:29,543
Well, that was just a joke
among the elders.

483
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:36,592
But a promise made in jest
is still a promise.

484
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,343
Of course.

485
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,268
What's going on? Is it a special day?

486
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:49,021
We are holding a memorial.

487
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:51,023
I see.

488
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:54,526
I guess memorial services
are taken very seriously here.

489
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,738
Please come this way.

490
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:00,824
You will need proper attire
to see my grandfather.

491
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,618
Right.

492
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:05,787
Your grandfather?

493
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:08,832
No way.

494
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,959
Is Shin Su-keunâ€¦

495
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:13,378
Is Lord Shin Su-keun your grandfather?

496
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,680
Oh my.

497
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,272
I shall have someone assist you.
Please wait here.

498
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:33,982
All right.

499
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:58,173
Are you Young Master's guest?

500
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:00,550
Young Master?

501
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:03,136
Oh, right. Yes, I am.

502
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,430
Come this way.

503
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:06,848
Okay.

504
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,559
Young Master?

505
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,210
I am here to escort you, Master.

506
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:31,224
Let us go.

507
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:39,191
Goodness.

508
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:41,276
Wait for me, Yoon-bok!

509
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:46,905
Did you invite this lady here, Yoon-bok?

510
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:48,824
Yes, Grandfather.

511
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:53,036
I have brought her here
as she has something to deliver to you.

512
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:04,923
Madam Camille, my superior at work,

513
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,176
has asked me
to deliver this to you in person.

514
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,971
Please forgive my impertinence.

515
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:14,641
Who did you say sent you here?

516
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,687
Madam Camille.

517
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:24,442
Would that old man open the gate?

518
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:25,861
Didn't you say he's as stubborn as a mule?

519
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:29,072
As long as Hong-do Kim delivers the gift,

520
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:32,117
he'll have no choice.

521
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:35,871
How are you so confident?

522
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,627
We are holding a family event.

523
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:45,422
Spend the night here and wait for my word.

524
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:48,800
You should get ready, Yoon-bok.

525
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:51,344
Yes, Grandfather.

526
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,567
How beautiful.

527
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:34,948
It seems I have found
the most beautiful painting in Paris.

528
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,617
Paris

529
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:40,870
is overshadowed

530
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:43,873
by your beauty.

531
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:01,391
<i>He gave me that key when he left me</i>

532
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:03,768
and said this.

533
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:13,862
I shall store away
our relationship in this box

534
00:46:14,362 --> 00:46:16,698
and forget anything has happened.

535
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:18,241
Therefore,

536
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:23,538
you must forget me as well
and live your life.

537
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:25,540
I don't want to.

538
00:46:25,623 --> 00:46:27,625
Are you really
choosing your family over me?

539
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:37,802
I am sorry.

540
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:40,805
If in the course of your life,

541
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:44,392
you ever wish to see me again,

542
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,146
this key will open my heart to you.

543
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:07,624
After so long,

544
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,752
she has finally sent this to me.

545
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:30,230
I shall inform you
of Grandfather's word soon.

546
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:31,648
Okay.

547
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,275
Don't worry about me
and do what you need to do.

548
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:05,390
YOON-BOK

549
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:11,688
One, two, three, four.

550
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:14,732
The last mark was in 2007.

551
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:17,569
That's when he was seven years old.

552
00:48:17,652 --> 00:48:20,488
YI-BOK, 2004, 2003
YOON-BOK, 2007

553
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,282
"Yi-bok"?

554
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,126
I'd like to help.

555
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:35,003
Are you sure?

556
00:48:35,587 --> 00:48:37,630
Yes. What can I do?

557
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:41,676
I have not seen you before.
Which family are you from?

558
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,095
Actually, I'm from Seoul.

559
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,932
How do you know Young Master Yoon-bok?

560
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:55,648
She was Young Master's master.

561
00:48:57,317 --> 00:48:58,151
His master?

562
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:02,822
At least, that's what he told me.
Am I correct?

563
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,199
Well, yes.

564
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:08,077
I was his teacher at an academy,

565
00:49:09,704 --> 00:49:10,830
not at school.

566
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:11,956
I see.

567
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,876
May I ask who the memorial is for?

568
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:20,006
Young Master Yoon-bok
must not have told you.

569
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:22,425
We're commemorating Lord Shin Sa-do,

570
00:49:22,508 --> 00:49:25,094
Young Master's father.

571
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,680
Lady Se-ryung here

572
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,558
graciously volunteers
to help us prepare every year.

573
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:33,436
He had thought of me so dearly.

574
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:35,772
It's only right I do this.

575
00:50:00,546 --> 00:50:03,341
COMMEMORATING THE DEATH OF SHIN SA-DO

576
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:16,437
SERVICE UNAVAILABLE

577
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:17,939
I can't get any signal.

578
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:19,732
I need to call Madam Camille.

579
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,048
I sent you a picture of Kim Chil-bok,
the man who was tied up at the club.

580
00:51:25,757 --> 00:51:27,467
It might not be his real name,

581
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,303
but could you please check
if he has a criminal record?

582
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,347
Thank you.

583
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,391
Goodbye.

<i>This is why I asked
for your name, Ms. Bodyguard.</i>

<i>With this episode,
I am concluding the series.</i>

588
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:02,919
<i>I hope to come back with better content.</i>

589
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,171
<i>See you again soon.</i>

00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:24,232
"Oh Yun-a"?

591
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:25,691
Her name is Yun-a?

592
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:28,444
Yun-a!

593
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:31,447
Yun-a!

WRITER KIM

595
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,330
<i>Strong lady Oh Yun-a!</i>

596
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:44,085
<i>You will be the muse
of my story starting today.</i>

597
00:52:45,044 --> 00:52:47,588
<i>From, Weak Man.</i>

598
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:57,140
Take care.

599
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,272
We shall take our leave now.

600
00:53:04,856 --> 00:53:05,815
Thank you for coming.

601
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,321
And again, I am grateful
for your help every year, Se-ryung.

602
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:17,368
It is the duty of a lady
to assist in her neighbors' matters.

603
00:53:20,288 --> 00:53:21,706
How commendable.

604
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:23,916
You are too generous, my lord.

605
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,252
You should be more honest.

606
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,796
Ever since she could walk,

607
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,674
she has talked about wanting to marry
Young Master Yoon-bok.

608
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:33,009
That is why she is here.

609
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:35,094
Father.

610
00:53:35,678 --> 00:53:36,971
Is that true?

611
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:55,281
I can actually see the stars here.

612
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:09,128
This is amazing.

613
00:54:12,256 --> 00:54:13,382
Look at that one.

614
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:26,729
TO LADY CAMILLE

615
00:54:26,812 --> 00:54:28,606
Deliver this to the lady.

616
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,441
Yes, Grandfather.

617
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,445
A very long time ago,

618
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:36,572
I left her with an emotional debt.

619
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:42,453
She seeks to host a fashion show
in Seongsan Village.

620
00:54:46,332 --> 00:54:47,833
What will you do?

621
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:53,547
I cannot let any harm
befall the village once again.

622
00:54:55,841 --> 00:54:56,884
Right.

623
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,470
Se-ryung was here earlier.

624
00:55:01,055 --> 00:55:03,933
Is it not time
for you to think of marriage?

625
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:14,443
She is upright, kind, and capable
of handling household matters.

626
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:17,321
Most importantly,
she thinks of you dearly.

627
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:19,282
You could not find a better spouse.

628
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:24,704
I shall handle my own marriage,
Grandfather.

629
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:25,746
By any chance,

630
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,084
do you have someone else in mind?

631
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:36,716
I shall inform you in time.

632
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:40,553
So please do not worry about my marriage.

633
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:43,597
Good night, Grandfather.

634
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:14,670
I shall inform you in time.

635
00:56:15,963 --> 00:56:18,799
So please do not worry about my marriage.

636
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:20,718
<i>Does he really</i>

637
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,929
<i>have feelings for someone else?</i>

638
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:38,462
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

639
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:40,923
<i>Why is my heart racing?</i>

640
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:59,024
NOW HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES
TO JOIN US AT SEONGSANGWAN

641
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:22,298
Is there something you wish to say to me?

642
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,215
What?

643
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:25,551
Oh, it's nothing.

644
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,012
Yoon-bok,

645
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:29,805
by any chance,

646
00:58:30,848 --> 00:58:32,224
do you have feelingsâ€¦

647
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:35,644
Well, what I mean isâ€¦

648
00:58:36,228 --> 00:58:37,271
Doâ€¦

649
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:39,815
Do you likeâ€¦

650
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:42,234
a certain type of food?

651
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,446
I enjoy eating vegetables.

652
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,072
Oh, right.

653
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:49,408
You've told me that.

654
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:55,414
Well, do you likeâ€¦

655
00:59:04,256 --> 00:59:05,633
Yoon-bok!

656
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:49,385
EPILOGUE

657
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:53,389
Are you certain Kim Chil-bok
came to the village 17 years ago?

658
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:57,017
Very well.

659
00:59:57,101 --> 01:00:00,312
Ask Inspector Park to find out
if he has a criminal record.

660
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:08,863
YOON-BOK, I'M ON MY WAY
TO SEONGSAN VILLAGEâ€¦

661
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:13,617
For what reason
would Master Kim visit Seongsan?

662
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:16,328
How rude of you!

663
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,123
How dare you try
to see the face of a lady?

664
01:00:19,206 --> 01:00:21,500
Unless you seek to be punished,
cease your harassment

665
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,586
- and open the gate now!
- Master Kim?

666
01:00:23,669 --> 01:00:24,712
Guards!

667
01:00:25,212 --> 01:00:27,798
Escort this criminal
out of the square immediately!

668
01:00:27,882 --> 01:00:30,009
- Sir?
- Stop!

669
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:31,802
I'm sorry. Please don't do this!

670
01:00:32,872 --> 01:00:36,768
DARE TO LOVE ME

671
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:38,601
Do you know anything about Yoon-bok's ex?

672
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:40,686
Wait, so that's why!

673
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:42,104
<i>Yoon-bok!</i>

674
01:00:42,187 --> 01:00:43,689
<i>I missed you, Yoon-bok.</i>

675
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:45,900
May I ask who you are?

676
01:00:45,983 --> 01:00:47,902
Do I have to answer that?

677
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:49,778
- Excuse me?
<i>- No.</i>

678
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:51,363
<i>Just open it!</i>

679
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,325
How are you still so stubborn as a mule
after all these years?

680
01:00:54,408 --> 01:00:55,576
Stubborn?

681
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:56,785
Administrator Lee.

682
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:59,121
- Escort this lady out of the village.
- What?

683
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:02,625
<i>A nobleman like Yoon-bok
would never do that.</i>

684
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,919
Our relationship
was severed a long time ago.

685
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:07,922
What do you say we tie it back up?

686
01:01:09,423 --> 01:01:12,384
I've looked up every Kim Chil-bok
in the country and no one looks like this.

687
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,179
<i>Either his name is fake,
or he got plastic surgery,</i>

688
01:01:15,763 --> 01:01:16,722
<i>or he's a ghost.</i>

689
01:01:16,805 --> 01:01:17,765
<i>It's one of the three.</i>

690
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:20,559
No matter what,
I'm going to end you tonight.

691
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:21,810
Stop right there!
