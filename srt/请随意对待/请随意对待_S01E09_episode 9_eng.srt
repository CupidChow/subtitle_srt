1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,380
   

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,330
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,710
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,290
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,260
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,010
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,800
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,140
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,060
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,980
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,410
   

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,480
   

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:03,090


14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,770
Yoon Bok.

15
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,830
How have you and Mother been all this time?

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,640
Since all we ever knew was Seongsan Village and had to leave suddenly...

17
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,680
it was hard to adjust and...

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,740
we didn't know what to do, either.

19
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,360
There were many hard days.

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,770
But Mom...

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
never forgot you, even during those hard times. Not even once.

22
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,340
The day she was diagnosed terminally ill,

23
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,360
she was hiding and crying while holding your baby clothes.

24
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,280
It really broke my heart.

25
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,450
I cried a lot behind closed doors, too.

26
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,080
To be honest...

27
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,460
I cried a lot, too.

28
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,120
You said you would come back by the time I counted to 100.

29
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,810
I'm sorry I didn't keep the promise.

30
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,380
Since I missed you, I only counted up to 99.

31
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,060
I haven't counted to 100 yet.

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,370
You...

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,120
kept your promise.

34
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,690
Yoon Bok.

35
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,890
   

36
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,160
I regret I never took a photo with Mother.

37
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,080
I should've found you sooner.

38
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,500
Please stop saying sorry now.

40
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,100
You would make me feel bad by always feeling bad.

41
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,030
Okay, I won't do that anymore.

42
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,410
Should we get a photo taken some time, then?

43
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,460
Mom would be happy to see it.

44
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,010
Let us do that.

45
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,230
 Mother, I will live as you told me to from now on. 

46
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,320
 So please... 

47
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,680
 watch me from where you are. 

48
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,030
 He looked like he was having a hard time. 

49
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,800
 Did the funeral go okay? 

50
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,550
 Maybe I should've gone. 

51
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,100
 No, no. It's a good thing I didn't go. 

52
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,400
 That would've been out of line. 

53
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,750
 But I still should've gone... 

54
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,740
Why do you keep standing up and sitting down?

55
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,900
Are you squatting?

56
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,780
Go to the gym if you're working out.

57
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,080
Right? I should go, right?

58
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll get going, then.

59
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,390
Yoon Bok!

60
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,650
Teacher,

61
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,620
where are you headed to?

62
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,980
Huh?

63
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,770
Oh, that...

64
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,770
I was wondering if you sent your mother off well.

65
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,050
I came out to stop by.

66
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,100
Did you?

67
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,350
I should have contacted you first.

68
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,950
I am sorry for making you worry.

69
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,050
No, it must've been hard for you.

70
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,370
Are you okay?

71
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Yes, I am okay.

72
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,160
To be honest,

73
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,280
it was a bit tough.

74
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,440
But I am trying to get better.

75
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,250
I see.

76
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,800
Is there anything I can do?

77
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,670
Ask me anything.

78
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,160
If so, please stay by my side like now.

79
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,560
What?

80
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,010
Yeah. Of course, I will.

81
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,840
 Yoon Bok... 

82
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,220
 changed. 

83
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,080
   

84
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,820
   

85
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,610
I was hoping you'd work with us until the end.

86
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,050
I'm a bit sad to hear that.

87
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,830
Thank you for everything.

88
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,090
The village will come up with a way to assist the investigation in my place.

89
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,320
Senior, have you eaten—

90
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,900
Sister.

91
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,360
 What? 

92
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,070
I should've told you sooner.

93
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,340
But I didn't want you to worry.

94
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,040
How could you not say a thing—

95
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,970
I... I asked him.

96
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,030
I volunteered to go undercover at Seongsan Hall, too.

97
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,040
Do what you want to do going forward.

98
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,420
Let me investigate the Gamjjok case instead.

99
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,390
- But— 
 - I'm...

100
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,340
a pretty good police officer.

101
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,770
Yes, she's pretty good.

102
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,940
All right.

103
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,040
But you need to let me know if something dangerous happens.

104
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,680
I will.

105
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,220
   

106
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,780
I know it took too long,

107
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,510
but I am finally going to pursue my dream freely.

108
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,180
Please accept me as your apprentice.

109
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,390
From head to toe,

110
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,760
and body to spirit,

111
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,410
you'll have to change everything.

112
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,530
Would you be able to...

113
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,530
walk that treacherous path?

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,980
Let's start with your clothes, then.

115
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,610
Start with the clothes.

116
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,300
I won't look.

117
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,750
I still have the dark circles I got from the clothing store last time.

118
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,280
No, I like it.

119
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,090
What?

120
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,410
This would be hard.

121
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,280
I used to eat this often.

122
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,210
It's tasty.

123
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,520
Wow, you're good at eating it.

124
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,580
You can handle spicy food.

125
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,610
Was someone here?

126
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,630
Yes, Yoon Bok.

127
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,260
Yoon Bok?

128
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,570
He wants to be my apprentice to pursue his dream.

129
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,900
 Yoon Bok put down the heavy burden and 

130
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,600
 decided to find what he wanted to do. 

131
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,120
The composition is wrong. The composition.

132
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,570
I was trying to show the beauty of negative space.

133
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,360
Just fill it up. Fill it up.

134
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,010
This is... Why did you paint the body?

135
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,500
Who takes a shower with clothes on?

136
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,790
I felt embarrassed to look at it.

137
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,040
I am sorry.

138
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,210
You get to wash the clothes if you shower with clothes on.

139
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,430
You kill two birds with one stone. Don't you agree, Yoon Bok?

140
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,620
I sometimes shower with clothes on.

141
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,660
You're supposed to be an artist, but you're so prejudiced.

142
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,100
How will you create good work?

143
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,730
I like the negative space, too.

144
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,690
Don't discourage Yoon Bok's exceptional creativity.

145
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,740
I'll go, then.

146
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,680
Have a nice day.

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,830
Teacher!

148
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,720
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

149
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,630
♫  Even after closing my eyes  ♫

150
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,010
♫  Even the faintest memories and nervous feeling—  ♫

151
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,010
 But what changed the most is... 

152
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,740
It's apparently cold today.

153
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,550
Have a nice day, then.

154
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,560
 ...the way Yoon Bok looks at me. 

155
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,790
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

156
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,330
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

157
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,610
Why did he put the scarf on me? Why?

158
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,670
It's his scarf.

159
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,240
Why did he put it on me?

160
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,800
♫  I looked for you everywhere  ♫

161
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,140
By chance, does he like me?

162
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,570
My gosh. Gosh!

163
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,260
That can't be.

164
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,090
Maybe he decided to be friendlier as a student.

165
00:13:54,090 --> 00:14:01,530
♫  When I hold you in my arms  ♫

166
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,650
What's going on?

167
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,010
I'm getting a scent of a man from you.

168
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,270
Pardon?

169
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,380
What do you mean?

170
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,800
Did you get a boyfriend?

171
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,060
That can't be.

172
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,170
Who put the scarf on you, then?

173
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,160
I did. I put it on myself.

174
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,210
Hong Do put it on Hong Do.

175
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,830
First of all, I approve of his taste.

176
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,430
 I will free myself... 

177
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,890
 from preserving tradition, 

178
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,560
 inheriting the village, or getting married! 

179
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,590
 I will not do anything you planned for me. 

180
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
 As Mother told me to, 

181
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,360
 I will do what I want to do... 

182
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,520
 and live freely from now on. 

183
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,590
Master, this is Yoon Ah.

184
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,530
 Come in. 

185
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,280
How is Yoon Bok doing?

186
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,750
Since the funeral,

187
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,190
he has been living with Lady Yi Bok.

188
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,540
Yes.

189
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,590
He needs time to feel comforted since he went through a lot.

190
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,560
You should help him get back to where he belongs soon.

191
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,540
- Yes, sir. 
 - Stop by and update me often.

192
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,930
Yes, sir.

193
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,580
He must be worn out physically and mentally grieving.

194
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,950
You should take good care of him, Yoon Ah.

195
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,470
- I will. 
 - Is he feeling sick at all?

196
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,020
He does not appear to be sick.

197
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,130
Is he not having a hard time?

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,190
He does not appear to be.

199
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,920
But he has been kind of strange.

200
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,590
Why? Is something wrong with him?

201
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,240
No, no. It is not like that.

202
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,830
He just changed a bit.

203
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,270
- What do you mean? 
 - He just...

204
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,710
did.

205
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,310
Yes.

206
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,420
Anyway, he is not his old self anymore.

207
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,980
Yoon Bok.

208
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,330
Teacher.

209
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,400
What are you doing here?

210
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,560
Artist Kim told me to draw that.

211
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,780
How was your day?

212
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,640
Did you stay warm?

213
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,990
Yes, thanks to you.

214
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,820
Have you had dinner?

215
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,450
Not yet.

216
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,470
Have you eaten?

217
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,710
I have not yet, either.

218
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,910
Should we eat together, then?

219
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,370
Yes!

220
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,510
Yes.

221
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,890
 He has no issue sharing a table anymore, either. 

222
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,070
Teacher,

223
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,210
eat more.

224
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,260
Okay, thank you.

225
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,710
 By chance, am I fooling myself 

226
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,610
 because I like Yoon Bok so much? 

227
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,800
 - By chance...  
 - Where's a plate...

228
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,980
Do you want a plate?

229
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,170
I will get it.

230
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,530
 No. To say I'm fooling myself, 

231
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,360
 Yoon Bok is acting too out of the ordinary. 

232
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,740
Teacher,

233
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,110
please sit here.

234
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,970
- Next to you? 
 - Yes.

235
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,550
Okay.

236
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,780
 By chance... 

237
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,900
 does Yoon Bok really like me? 

238
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,020
Teacher, please have some.

239
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,240
Thank you.

240
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,890
- You should have some, too. 
 - Please go ahead.

241
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,280
Fine. Here.

242
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,100
He's a student who cares for his teacher. My student.

243
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,080
He's being polite, you know.

244
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,330
I say, "Be." You say, "Polite."

245
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,710
Maybe you got sick because you've been through a lot.

246
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,240
Take care of yourself.

247
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,290
Is it because I'm tired?

248
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,440
Here.

249
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,820
You used to want this whenever you got sick.

250
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,590
Mom used to make this for me.

251
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,830
Eat it while it's hot.

252
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,730
Thank you.

253
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,570
Let me do it.

254
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,990
It was a lot of work to make that.

255
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,700
So make sure to finish it.

256
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,860
Sitting here like this reminds me of the old days.

257
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,470
We were so happy then.

258
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,190
Right?

259
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,080
 You bastard! 

260
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,180
 How dare you make the precious child sick? 

261
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,610
I'm glad...

262
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,000
that it's a happy memory for you.

263
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,970
 To me, it was a scar I couldn't recover from. 

264
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,680
The villagers are complaining about your scream every night.

265
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,580
I told you to open their hearts, but you only open their eardrums.

266
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,970
Try living there for a day.

267
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,410
See if you can help screaming.

268
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,390
I don't know where the cuckoo is, either.

269
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,320
That is why I got you a room in the Woorim House.

270
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,200
Stay here from now on. Make yourself at—

271
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,640
I'll make myself at home, then.

272
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,450
This room is in much better condition.

273
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,080
Right.

274
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,610
I heard about what happened at the tea house.

275
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,340
Looks like you are having a hard time having people open up to you.

276
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,360
Feel free to leave anytime if you want to give up.

277
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm Camille.

278
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,010
I don't know how to give up.

279
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,720
So, don't worry about stuff like that.

280
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,400
I can manage to open up their hearts.

281
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,700
Come on. Stop touching them so much.

282
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,790
This is so pretty.

283
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,760
Which pair is the most popular?

284
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,830
These are popular...

285
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,540
and these are popular, too.

286
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,030
Ooh-la-la.

287
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,180
What's this?

288
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,210
You mean the pichohye?

289
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,030
Pichohye?

290
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,030
They are leather sandals that were trendy a few centuries ago.

291
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,370
No one wants them since they have been forgotten.

292
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,580
How could that happen to these beautiful shoes?

293
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,990
I'll buy these.

294
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,440
   

295
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,110
Where does the internet work again?

296
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,760
   

297
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,040
This must be a new series.

298
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,440
Okay. Let me make a comment.

299
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,200
Please upload the...

300
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,680
next episode soon.

301
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,350
Otherwise, I'll get sick waiting.

302
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,060
 Gosh, I'm getting wi-fi here. 

303
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,030
My gosh.

304
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,330
It worked!

305
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,560
Look at these. They're so pretty.

306
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,940
Wow, so pretty.

307
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,070
That woman made these.

308
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,010
- Have a look. 
 - Wow.

309
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,070
Wow, these are so pretty.

310
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,510
- They're amazing. Amazing! 
 - That lady made these?

311
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,100
Yes, yes. They are so pretty.

312
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,660
- Here you go. 
 - I hope you sell a lot.

313
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
I will have a pair of pichohye.

314
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,560
- What is your size? 
 - Two muns and a half.

315
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,410
Hold on a moment.

316
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,640
- Mr. Shoemaker. 
 - Yes.

317
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,170
I will take a pair, too.

318
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,710
- What is your size? 
 - Two muns.

319
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,500
Okay, got it.

320
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,060
Here you go.

321
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,040
Yes. Goodness.

322
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,000
I want to buy pichohye.

323
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,830
My goodness. How does a young lady like you know pichohye?

324
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,010
- I will have a pair, too. 
 - Pardon?

325
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,020
- I will have them, too. 
 - Do you have a different style?

326
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,230
This is overwhelming.

327
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,860
Line up, then!

328
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,260
Goodness. Here they are.

329
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,840
 Are you in there? 

330
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:27,780
By chance, if you're offended that I altered your work,

331
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,850
I apologize.

332
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,900
No.

333
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,140
I am here to thank you.

334
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,690
Thanks to you, the forgotten traditional shoes are getting popular again.

335
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,300
It makes me so happy.

336
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,270
You saved a tradition that could have been erased.

337
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,310
You're exaggerating.

338
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,380
Most of all, I was quite impressed with

339
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,470
your skills and creativity.

340
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,750
How about we do more, then?

341
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,130
If there are a few more items like pichohye,

342
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,590
you should collaborate with me.

343
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,580
Collaborate? 
  (Sounds like "pick one" in Korean) 

344
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,940
What am I supposed to pick?

345
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,700
My gosh.

346
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,110
She wants to open a popup store to collaborate with Mr. Shoemaker.

347
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,310
Wow.

348
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,610
The villagers must be starting to open up to her.

349
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,710
The stubborn old men are changing their minds.

350
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,670
They must be finally starting to like Camille, too.

351
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,140
 By the way, why are you walking so far away from me? 

352
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,960
 I cannot dare to step on your shadow. 

353
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,020
 Why are you sitting there, then? 

354
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,160
 As I said, a teacher is like a king and father. 

355
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,570
 I cannot dare to share a table with you. 

356
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,330
 Teacher, 

357
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,690
 eat more. 

358
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,460
 I never thought Yoon Bok would change, either. 

359
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,370
 But he changed so much. 

360
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,600
 Is he starting to like me, by chance? 

361
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,210
Or is he not?

362
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,510
 Yoon Bok likes me. He doesn't like me. 

363
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,370
 He likes me. He doesn't. 

364
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,010
 He likes me. 

365
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,120
 He doesn't. 

366
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,710
 Should I just call and ask him? 

367
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,420
 No, what if we grow apart again? 

368
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,440
I don't even want to think about it.

369
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,320
   

370
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,860
   

371
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,570
   

372
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,250
Smell?

373
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,760
Your boyfriend cheated.

374
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,470
It's nothing compared to a cheating husband.

375
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,920
   
 (Means, "Nothing compared to") 

376
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,350
I'm torn between Korean and English majors.

377
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,970
You can't decide between Korean and English?

378
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,660
Yes.

379
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,510
If so, it's bubble tea.

380
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,660
- Bubble tea? 
 - Count each bubble and eat it slowly.

381
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,480
If it's an odd number, it's Korean.

382
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,350
If it's an even number, it's English. Okay?

383
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,110
Okay.

384
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,370
What's your worry?

385
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,720
My worry is...

386
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,020
Senior Hyang Gi?

387
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,880
Hong Do?

388
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,980
I was totally screwed after you left.

389
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,100
I got on the industry blacklist for copying your design.

390
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,770
It was difficult to stay.

391
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,110
So I decided not to stay.

392
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,120
She sure is privileged.

393
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,490
I thought about what I was good at besides making clothes.

394
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,800
You know, too. I'm good at listening to other people's worries.

395
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,370
- You are? 
 - Yes.

396
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,950
I thought about you a lot while listening to others' relationship issues.

397
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,720
I was reminded of getting duped by that Lee Do Yeong bastard, too.

398
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,570
Oh, did you break up?

399
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,000
What did he say when I said I'd quit?

400
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,080
Yes, "fake." He called me a fake!

401
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,490
He said you were the real deal.

402
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,380
That crazy bastard.

403
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,720
That's totally his repertoire.

404
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,150
He told me you were the real deal and I was fake.

405
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,290
Hong Do,

406
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,780
just one moment.

407
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,380
Okay.

408
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,820
It's an apple pie.

409
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,360
I apologize. 
  ("Apologize" and "apple" is the same word in Korean) 

410
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm sorry I copied your drawstring bag

411
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,360
and I'm sorry I misunderstood you only after listening to Lee Do Yeong.

412
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,770
Thank you for the pie.

413
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,630
By the way, what brings you here?

414
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,220
Do you have a worry?

415
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,380
What? He separated the perilla leaves for you?

416
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,380
We know the answer, then. He likes you.

417
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,440
You do that for your family members, too.

418
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,050
Hong Do, does he smile or not when he looks at you?

419
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,200
He smiles.

420
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,680
He likes you. He totally likes you!

421
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,160
If everyone who smiles likes you—

422
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,140
Men don't smile if they don't like you.

423
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,350
He smiles whenever he sees you.

424
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,030
He doesn't often smile, but he smiles at you.

425
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,010
He only smiles at you.

426
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,770
If it's one of these three, he's fond of you.

427
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,860
If two, he's flirting.

428
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,600
If all three, it's true love.

429
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,070
True love?

430
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,840
Kim Hong Do! Lucky you!

431
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,870
Come on. It's not like that.

432
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,990
Yoon Bok must be here.

433
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,350
Yes.

434
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,910
You smile whenever you see the teacher,

435
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,930
you want to know where she is, when she's coming back,

436
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,240
and you want to be with her. Why do you think that is?

437
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
It's because you totally love her.

438
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,980
That is truly love...

439
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,060
Love?

440
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,580
It is not.

441
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,570
I have to be like that because she is my teacher.

442
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,550
Come on, it's not like that.

443
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,730
You're like that because you like her.

444
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,700
Yes, that's right. Good!

445
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,890
I have to disagree.

446
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:23,130
One can do that out of respect alone without being in love.

447
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,040
If the other person misinterprets it,

448
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,690
it is nothing but misunderstanding.

449
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,820
I suppose you do that to my sister.

450
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,200
W-What did you say just now?

451
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,620
You can do that with respect alone?

452
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,790
Seeing you helps me understand it.

453
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:56,030
Hey, I just realized I made a great mistake.

454
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,360
What?

455
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,700
I need to talk to the Teacher so she does not misunderstand.

456
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,580
Where are you going? We were in the middle of a meeting.

457
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,650
Where should I start changing the story?

458
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:39,850
 One can do that out of respect alone without being in love. 

459
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,500
It wasn't true love.

460
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,230
It was respect.

461
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,160
Respect...

462
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:03,210
 She might not have understood my intention at all. 

463
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,520
I should tell her honestly tomorrow.

464
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,680
Is Teacher home?

465
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,300
She went to work, of course.

466
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,650
Already?

467
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,260
She left earlier than usual today.

468
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,070
- What's that? 
 - It's—

469
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,900
Sswanghwacha? 
  (Medicinal herb tea) 

470
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,830
Wow, this is the real deal.

471
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,910
Hold on, hold on. This is not yours.

472
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,950
- Let me take a sip— 
 - No.

473
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,660
It is mine.

474
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,520
It is mine.

475
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,810
I'm not ready yet.

476
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm not ready to be heartbroken!

477
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,830
 Seongsan Hall? 

478
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,110
 I was looking for the areas without CCTVs 

479
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,710
and I found Seongsan Hall.

480
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,290
And we found out that...

481
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:17,560
the products were untouched before they reached Seongsan Hall.

482
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,550
Seongsan Hall seems to be linked to this case?

483
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,170
The gangsters we caught recently said Seongsan Hall is...

484
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,060
 where Gamjjok does trading. 

485
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,610
So, that means Gamjjok can be behind this, too?

486
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,660
 I'll check if there are any suspicious activities at Seongsan Hall. 

487
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,730
All profits will be donated to the retrieval of cultural heritage.

488
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,550
You can promote the fashion show, the brand image,

489
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,340
and help the Cultural Heritage Administration greatly, too.

490
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,520
What do we need to prepare, then?

491
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,930
We'd like you to recommend a popup store location.

492
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:14,180
A place that can accommodate both Camille and Seongsan Village is...

493
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,460
Oh, I have a place in mind.

494
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,960
It must've been a difficult decision since the restaurant needs to be run, too.

495
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,260
Thank you so much for helping us.

496
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,870
Of course, I should help. It was the Director's request.

497
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,190
Take time to look around and make suggestions.

498
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,890
We'll prepare accordingly.

499
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,390
Thank you.

500
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,850
Well, then.

501
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,540
Wow.

502
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,110
I love this so much.

503
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,320
We can set the stage up here.

504
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,840
V.

505
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,710
I'll check out the backyard.

506
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,480
Okay.

507
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,140
Look at the flowers. My goodness.

508
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,620
   

509
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,200
A classic and modern face.

510
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,900
And the impeccable proportion.

511
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,020
Are you interested in modeling, by chance?

512
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,620
I think you mistook me...

513
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,920
   

514
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,500
Are you from Camille?

515
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Yes. I'm from Camille.

516
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,190
Really?

517
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,810
Someone I know works at Camille, too.

518
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,320
Do you know someone named Kim Hong Do?

519
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,930
Do you know someone named Kim Hong Do?

520
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,160
Kim Hong Do? Hong Do Kim? You know Hong Do Kim?

521
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,860
She's here with me.

522
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,250
Is Teacher here, too?

523
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,040
Where...

524
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,100
Hong Do!

525
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,970
What are you doing there?

526
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,510
Teacher.

527
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,900
Hey, Yoon Bok. Hi.

528
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:37,110
Yoon Bok is here, too.

529
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,010
Is something going on?

530
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,920
I stopped by to see you,

531
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,240
but I needed to talk to Teacher, too.

532
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,170
This is perfect.

533
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,300
Teacher, could you set some time aside for me—

534
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,460
My gosh! Look at the time!

535
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,020
I'm sorry. I need to get back to the office.

536
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,560
We don't have time right now. Right?

537
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,780
We don't?

538
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,380
Not even just a moment?

539
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,770
I need to talk to you urgently.

540
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,280
Camille is waiting. I'm sorry.

541
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,540
Let's go.

542
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,110
I'm sorry.

543
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,790
Teacher.

544
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,540
Call me.

545
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,050
Hey...

546
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:37,190
For some reason, I detected Hong Do Kim's scent from that man.

547
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,400
- Pardon? 
 - Was that scarf his?

548
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,140
Gosh! No, it's not.

549
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,150
Gosh, no, no.

550
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,990
Let's go now.

551
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,750
Yes, it is him. Come on, girl.

552
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,730
Wait for me.

553
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,060
Hong Do Kim! Wait for me, I said!

554
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,470
You said you needed to talk to me.

555
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,840
What could it be? Need relationship advice?

556
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,740
To be honest,

557
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,230
I overheard your phone conversation with Detective Park.

558
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,200
Are we talking about the case again?

559
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,840
I said I can take care of it myself.

560
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,450
Gamjjok also seems to have been linked to the fire at Seongsan Village 17 years ago.

561
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,940
- What? 
 - He apparently has a wound on his arm.

562
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:42,250
Pay close attention to the visitors' arms.

563
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,750
Okay! Let's hurry!

564
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,750
Is the main course for table No. 3 not ready yet?

565
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,780
It's almost ready.

566
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,500
Okay, please hurry a bit.

567
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,440
What do they say?

568
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,570
Are they saying it's terrible?

569
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,410
Do they want me to quit again?

570
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,550
It is not even that.

571
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,550
By chance, are there no comments?

572
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,500
Just have a look at it yourself.

573
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,230
 Hong Hak is full of a sense of justice. I love you. 

574
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,600
 I know a hit when I see one. 

575
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,630
 I'm enjoying this so much. 

576
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,240
 Wow, I love Yeojudaek. She's amazing. 

577
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,380
 The artist must've made a deal with the devil. He's suddenly good. 

578
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,160
 Upload the next episode soon. Otherwise, I'll get sick waiting. 

579
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:15,960
Are these really the comments for my series?

580
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,220
I'm not dreaming, right?

581
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,780
I wonder.

582
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:28,920
I think the comments are about the protagonist of the series.

583
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,660
Good work, Artist Kim.

584
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,880
You provided the story and inspiration.

585
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,840
You're giving me pastry now?

586
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,210
Do you ever stop being generous, Yoon Ah?

587
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,190
Yoon Ah!

588
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,860
I will go to the restroom real quick.

589
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,300
Just eat that while waiting.

590
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,960
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

591
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,810
Right?

592
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,370
That's why you want to break up!

593
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,610
It's not like that, I said!

594
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,240
I just...

595
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,940
no longer think of you as...

596
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,390
Hey.

597
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,490
Hey. Hey!

598
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,240
 The artist must be a strong man who doesn't tolerate injustice. 

599
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,160
You little...

600
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,650
Who the hell?

601
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,080
Me?

602
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,910
I guess you can say I'm...

603
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:41,570
a strong man who doesn't tolerate injustice. Kim Hong—

604
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,090
You bastard.

605
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,260
Blood.

606
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,060
Shit.

607
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,790
Are you the bastard Hye Rim was with last night?

608
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,720
You need to gauge the opponent first.

609
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,770
What would you have done if I were not around?

610
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,460
You were still pretty cool, though.

611
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,940
Really?

612
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,410
You are nothing without courage, no matter how strong you are.

613
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,710
You are not strong, but you have courage.

614
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,580
You have plenty of...

615
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,940
potential to become a strong man someday.

616
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,940
Why don't I muster up the courage and try again—

617
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,810
Please sit still.

618
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,420
Seriously. It is not on yet.

619
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,860
It's on now.

620
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,610
I'm a strong man.

621
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,520
 Teacher, when are you coming back? 

622
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,090
 Would it be okay if I picked you up? 

623
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,550
 No, I'm working late tonight. 

624
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,560
 See you some other time. 

625
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,010
   

626
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,100
   

627
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,040
Should I make the fonts bigger?

628
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,340
Yes, that'd be better. I'll change the colors, too.

629
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,240
 Anyone in there? 

630
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,640
Teacher.

631
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,440
 Yoon Bok. 

632
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,020
 Teacher might feel uncomfortable. 

633
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,880
 I should pretend like I am doing something else. 

634
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,210
 Yoon Bok. 

635
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:24,580
 Teacher. 

636
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,190
 What are you doing here? 

637
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:31,090
 Artist Kim told me to draw that. 

638
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:48,010
 We'll need a plate for the fruit. 

639
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,920
 The plates... 

640
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,860
 Do you want a plate? 

641
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,500
 I will get it. 

642
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,760
 We'll need more plates. 

643
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,120
 I think we need another plate. 

644
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,880
 Huh? 

645
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,340
 Okay. 

646
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,980
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

647
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,000
♫  Even after closing my eyes  ♫

648
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:52,650
♫  Even the faintest memories and nervous feelings that were left behind  ♫

649
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,950
♫  Everything was you  ♫

650
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:02,910
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

651
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:08,100
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

652
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,980
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

653
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,940
Do not go.

654
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:24,570
♫  I wonder if you're also under the same night sky  ♫

655
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:30,380
♫  I looked for you everywhere  ♫

656
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,370
Yoon Bok.

657
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,390
I like you.

658
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,730
I...

659
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,660
like you, Teacher.

660
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,930
Oh.

661
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,600
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

662
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,750
♫  I met someone who resembles you  ♫

663
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:04,240
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫

664
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,100
♫  When I hold you in my arms  ♫

665
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:19,670
♫  Will you say, "It's been a while," and hug me with a smile?  ♫

666
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:25,030
♫  Even in my dreams, meet me one last  ♫

667
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:29,370
♫  Dreaming one last  ♫

668
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:34,850


669
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,830
   

670
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:41,510
Wow, this is unbelievably cool.

671
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,570
I know I drew it, but it's really—

672
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,460
This makes no sense!

673
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,130
- What? 
 - Kissing means your hearts are in sync.

674
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,400
But they are saying goodbye? It makes no sense!

675
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,450
Huh? What will we do, then?

676
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:59,110
You need to consider marriage if you kiss someone.

677
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:02,280
How could you think of relationships so lightly?

678
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,650
I will go get some cold water.

679
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,630
Seriously, this is...

680
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:12,600
What kind of nonsense is this?

681
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,170
His taste is too different than mine.

682
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:19,430
I'll need to fire him soon.

683
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,100
♫  ...but it's already here  ♫

684
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:26,820
    
  ♫  You smiled at me brighter than sunshine  ♫

685
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,760
 Teacher, would you like to spend time with me tomorrow? 

686
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,630
 This is so nice. 

687
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,510
 This is basically heaven. 

688
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,340
 You're so cute! 

689
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,330
 You're cute enough to destroy the universe. 

690
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,050
 Kim Hong Do is an easy woman! 

691
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,620
 She has no issue holding random men's hands! 

692
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:45,210
 Teacher, please look away for a moment. 

693
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,590
 - Teacher? 
 - Just one moment, Yoon Bok. 

694
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,200
 Teacher! 

695
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,250
♫  Every day is about you  ♫
