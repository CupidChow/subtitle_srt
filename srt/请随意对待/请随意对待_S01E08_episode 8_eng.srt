1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
   

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,380
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,780
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,560
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,340
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,870
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,360
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,320
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,100
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,570
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,330
   

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,510
   

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:56,980


14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,160
   

15
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,180
Excuse me for a moment.

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,670
Yoon Bok!

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,890
Yi Bok told me.

18
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,420
Your mother really wants to see you.

19
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,530
I didn't want to just sit and watch.

20
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,110
I know it's not my place, but—

21
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,270
Yes, it is not your place.

22
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,660
You know nothing about it, but you reached a conclusion.

23
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,860
And you are forcing me like this.

24
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,250
I will not listen even though it is coming from you, Teacher.

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,660
But you came all this way.

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,940
Since you are already here—

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,850
I came to see you. I did not come to see her...

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,750
Please do not get involved in my business anymore.

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,940
I will leave now.

30
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,340
Yoon Bok.

31
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,610
How much longer will you keep your guard up like that?

32
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,810
Will you continue to close yourself up

33
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,880
for the rest of your life without letting anyone in?

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,700
I find that easier.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,960
Easier?

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,430
Is it really easy to ignore the people who love and worry about you?

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,880
No one can always live alone.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,640
Even though it's hard, you have to worry, care,

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,660
and try to understand each other.

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,550
Living together like that, even though it gets difficult,

41
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,730
isn't that what happiness is about?

42
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,410
Being together is happy?

43
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,990
I mistakenly thought that briefly, too.

44
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,950
I mean,

45
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,400
I wanted to be mistaken.

46
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,840
But to me,

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,570
that is not everything.

48
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,930
I have things I need to do, protect,

49
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,420
and a heart that should not waver.

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,250
I cannot be tricked by the happiness of being together

51
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,630
and neglect those things.

52
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,800
I granted your three wishes as I promised.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,480
Please...

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,020
leave me alone now.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,150
♫  You faded away with the old memories  ♫

56
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:25,260
♫  I try to erase you little by little slowly  ♫

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,660
♫  The last piece of you becomes tears  ♫

58
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:41,080
♫  I don't think it'll ever dry out  ♫

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,480
♫  It's no longer useful to feel hopeful  ♫

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,610
 Mother, 

61
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,000
 are you going somewhere? 

62
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,340
 Take me with you. 

63
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,950
 Seven. 

64
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,040
 Eight. 

65
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,510
 Nine. 

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:17,720
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end, but  ♫

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,400
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

68
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Mom!

69
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Mom...

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,930
Are you okay?

71
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,670
Mom!

72
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,670
Mom!

73
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,790
Mom, what's wrong?

74
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:44,700
♫  As if our time together never happened  ♫

75
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:56,430
♫  The last piece that was left behind reminds me of you  ♫

76
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,370
 Easier? 

77
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,610
 Is it really easy to ignore the people who love and worry about you? 

78
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,640
♫  You're no longer by my side  ♫

79
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,090
I think you should prepare yourself.

80
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:22,170
♫  I'm sorry I keep feeling scared  ♫

81
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,280
♫  I'm afraid we'll end up breaking up  ♫

82
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,350
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end  ♫

83
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:42,660
♫  But now I'll let you go  ♫

84
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,440
   

85
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,610
Be gentle.

86
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,770
You cannot even endure this much pain.

87
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,440
Why did you do that?

88
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,010
A strong man does things like that instinctively.

89
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,060
I gambled my life and made the decision of a lifetime.

90
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,530
I went all in on you.

91
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,910
Why are you always so reckless?

92
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,730
Because I want to try it again.

93
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,230
Pardon?

94
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,660
W-What did you say?

95
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,390
I cannot let that happen.

96
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,490
Doing it once was confusing enough.

97
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,010
But you want to do it again? How come—

98
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,980
Well, I meant the webtoon.

99
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,130
Oh, that?

100
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,450
Of course, I knew you were talking about that.

101
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,260
I swear I was not thinking of something else.

102
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,420
Of course, I want to try that again, too,

103
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,440
but I will wait until you want to.

104
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,730
I do not know what you are talking about.

105
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,180
I've wondered if I should give up on making webtoons,

106
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,650
but I can't give up.

107
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,350
I want to give it another try,

108
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,010
but I don't think I can do it alone.

109
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,070
I need your help, Yoon Ah.

110
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,930
Yoon Ah,

111
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,720
please be my muse.

112
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,460
Muse?

113
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,070
So, I kicked that man who was three times bigger than me

114
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,360
in a 540-degree angle like this.

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,570
That man... To exaggerate a little bit,

116
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,460
he got lodged in the wall like this.

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,960
So, 540 degrees is...

118
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,120
So...

119
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,430
Look.

120
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,700
But you brought so much stuff.

121
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,420
You should've told me the house is this small.

122
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,890
Since it is your first day, I steamed a few potatoes for you.

123
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,830
Eat these if you are hungry.

124
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,540
There is a stove and a pot in there.

125
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,750
Do not skip meals and cook for yourself.

126
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,710
Where is the nearest mart?

127
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,810
Mart?

128
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,990
Walk where the sun rises, and you will get to the market.

129
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,130
You can buy whatever you need there.

130
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,160
If something happens,

131
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,580
walk toward where the cuckoos are cooing for about 30 minutes.

132
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,370
Woorim House, where I live, is there. Okay?

133
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,120
Cuckoo?

134
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,540
You mean this sound?

135
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,140
That was an owl.

136
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,420
Anyway, I just need to open up people's hearts living here. Right?

137
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,970
Yes, but living here will not be easy.

138
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,690
Fighting!

139
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,140
The air is nice.

140
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,250
Should I go for a walk?

141
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,070
Did it seem she would adjust well?

142
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,430
I am not sure.

143
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,050
Whether the villagers will get used to her is a bigger concern.

144
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,320
Okay. The mart is this way. Right?

145
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,160
Hello.

146
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,800
How hideous.

147
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,950
Hello.

148
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,410
   

149
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,030
   

150
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,650
♫  My gosh, my gosh  ♫

151
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,220
What would you like?

152
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,550
Do you have coffee?

153
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,230
Coffee?

154
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,520
We do.

155
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,590
   
 (Means "coffee" in old Korean) 

156
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,870
Where?

157
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,580
It is written right there.

158
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,790
Seriously. Are her eyes broken?

159
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,030
Anyway, I'll have a coffee.

160
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,200
A cappuccino with plenty of steamed milk in it.

161
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,190
Cappu, what?

162
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,230
Cappuccino.

163
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,930
Oh, you might not have a cappuccino.

164
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,620
I'll just have a coffee.

165
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,000
This place is better known for nokcha than gabae. 
  (Means "green tea") 

166
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,260
Nokcha?

167
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,910
Oh, green tea?

168
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,440
I don't really like green tea...

169
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,020
 If more than half of the village opens up, 

170
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,090
 the deal will go through. 

171
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,060
I'll take it. I'll have a green tea.

172
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,840
So bitter.

173
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,350
Excuse me.

174
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,520
- What? 
 - Can I have cold milk and a bottle with a lid?

175
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,730
Give me some sugar and a spoon, too.

176
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,550
This is it.

177
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,830
What are you doing? What did I do to offend you?

178
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,750
Get out of here!

179
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,060
   

180
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,450
- Wait... 
 - Where did she go?

181
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,560
- My gosh! 
 - Goodness! Goodness!

182
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,550
My gosh, my gosh! My goodness!

183
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,750
Gosh, seriously. I cannot believe it.

184
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,280
 I have things I need to do, protect, 

185
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,140
 and a heart that should not waver. 

186
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,510
 I cannot be tricked by the happiness of being together 

187
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,910
 and neglect those things. 

188
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,080
 How much longer will you keep your guard up like that? 

189
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,160
 Will you continue to close yourself up 

190
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,650
 for the rest of your life without letting anyone in? 

191
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,310
 Yoon Bok, I think Mom will pass away soon. 

192
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,740
Young Master, are you awake?

193
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,620
Young Master.

194
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,430
   

195
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,200
You avoided me whenever I went to see you.

196
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,790
Is this how you avoid me this time?

197
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,620
I came to ask you something.

198
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,470
Why...

199
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,200
did you abandon me?

200
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,360
Do you know how much I waited for you?

201
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,760
I waited nonstop every day.

202
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,230
But you still did not come.

203
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,740
How could you show up in this state?

204
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,940
I cannot forgive you, Mother.

205
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,930
That is why I will...

206
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,790
abandon you this time.

207
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,130
Geez, we're so busy. Why isn't the part-timer here?

208
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,920
I know. She didn't even call in.

209
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,110
Why is the kitchen such a mess?

210
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,450
- I'm sorry. 
 - Tidy up immediately.

211
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,470
I'll clean up right now.

212
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,670
 I don't think I can come to work for a few days. 

213
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,150
- What's going on? 
  - I have a situation at home. 

214
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,050
 I'm sorry. 

215
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,250
Yi Bok.

216
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm here.

217
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,570
Thank you.

218
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,870
   

219
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,740
Young Master, did you stay up all night?

220
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,270
This is the only spot where the truck has been without a CCTV.

221
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,700
I need to find a way to find out what happened at that spot.

222
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,100
Oh, okay.

223
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,940
When did the weather get so cold?

224
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,860
What is this?

225
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,020
I bought it in Seoul while waiting for you. It's not much.

226
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,370
What is it?

227
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,260
Come on.

228
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,380
Open it after I go inside.

229
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,480
What's wrong with him?

230
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,250
My goodness.

231
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,280
Geez...

232
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,060
Geez, he's so silly.

233
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,820
Silly?

234
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,950
Silly...

235
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,370
How warm.

236
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,140
- Yeojudaek. 
 - Yes?

237
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,760
Deliver this to His Excellency Lee for me.

238
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,680
By chance, is this...

239
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,650
Let Yoon Bok know, too.

240
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,330
Okay.

241
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,820
What? We got what?

242
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,810
Father.

243
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,080
Father, is it true we received a wedding proposal from Yoon Bok's family?

244
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,430
Father, is it true we received a wedding proposal from Yoon Bok's family?

245
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,530
We will have to choose a nice day.

246
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,560
Father!

247
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,300
Young Master.

248
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,990
What is going on?

249
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,120
I just heard from Yeokjudaek.

250
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,910
The Master sent...

251
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,720
a wedding proposal to Lady Se Ryeong's house.

252
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,600
Wedding proposal?

253
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,890
Young Master, are you getting married?

254
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,750
I thought I made myself clear to him.

255
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,480
But he ended up making that decision.

256
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,140
Is this an arranged marriage that I've only heard about?

257
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,030
Will you really do it?

258
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,670
I do not want to, but how could I avoid it?

259
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,220
I wonder if Camille is doing well over there.

260
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,310
I cannot reach her.

261
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,290
She needs to drink at least two cappuccinos a day.

262
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,740
She's probably doing okay since we haven't heard from her yet.

263
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,300
They say no news means good news.

264
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,020
   

265
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,480
Excuse me.

266
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,440
Hey, Yi Bok.

267
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,310
Will you stay in the village today, too?

268
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,860
I will ask Grandfather about the wedding proposal

269
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,020
and practice swordsmanship all night.

270
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,730
- Hello? 
  - Is this Ms. Pi Hye Won's son? 

271
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,460
 Your mother has passed away. 

272
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,120
   

273
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,740
I feel so sorry for my mom...

274
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,150
I'm glad you came, Yoon Bok.

275
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,920
I came because I thought this was my last duty.

276
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,310
That is the only reason.

277
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,830
Wait, Yoon Bok.

278
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,480
Wait just a moment. I'll be right back.

279
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,710
Yoon Bok.

280
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,970
You're here.

281
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,210
You haven't eaten, right? Come. Let's eat.

282
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,880
No.

283
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,760
I am okay.

284
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,980
What is this?

285
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,890
Mom asked me to give this to you.

286
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,910
Make sure to open it.

287
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,580
And...

288
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,870
thank you for coming.

289
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,630
 Mom asked me to give this to you. 

290
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,900
 My dear son, Yoon Bok. 

291
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:20,960
 I'm sorry I hurt you so much when I left you. 

292
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:27,420
 You might not be able to forgive me for what I did, 

293
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,710
 but consider this as my last wish 

294
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,060
 and listen to me just this once. 

295
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,030
 I married your father when I was 20 years old. 

296
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,670
 Since the marriage was arranged a long time ago, 

297
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,630
 I wasn't able to make a different decision. 

298
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,010
 There you go. 

299
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,500
 All right. 

300
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,060
 Peekaboo! Peekaboo! 

301
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,740
 Peekaboo! 

302
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,260
 What do you think? Isn't he cute? 

303
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,480
 Mom, Yoon Bok is so cute. 

304
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,030
 I was so happy when a precious and sweet baby 

305
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,690
 like you were born, Yoon Bok. 

306
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,830
 You're the Woorim family's eldest son who will lead this village. 

307
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,390
 You do not have enough time to study literature and martial arts. 

308
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,670
 How could you do something so useless? 

309
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,680
 How dare you shed tears? 

310
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,710
 But whenever I saw how much pressure you were under as a young boy, 

311
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,620
 my heart shattered into pieces. 

312
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,660
 Are you bringing that up again? 

313
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,280
 I told you many times that we cannot open up the village. 

314
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:58,260
 Father, the children should be able to decide what kind of life they want to live. 

315
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,620
 I cannot let them live like me. 

316
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,010
 Old things are bound to get destroyed if you leave them as they are. 

317
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,520
 I agree with her about this matter. So, please— 

318
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,630
 Quiet! 

319
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,980
 You are the Woorim family's eldest son and the village's future leader. 

320
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,080
 How could you say that? 

321
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,620
 Are you in the right mind? 

322
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,200
 What a fool. 

323
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,770
 Due to our relentless persuasion, 

324
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,980
 Grandfather allowed us to open up the village. 

325
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,650
 Brought to you from Seongsan Village— 

326
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,920
 Fire! Fire! 

327
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,560
 Fire! 

328
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,770
 What's going on? 

329
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,920
 But an unexpected tragedy occurred. 

330
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,960
 I opened up the village because of you, and as a result, 

331
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,030
 my son died. 

332
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,650
 You killed my son, Sa Do. 

333
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,560
 Leave immediately. 

334
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,330
 Father, 

335
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,610
 how could you— 

336
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,220
 I cannot let you care for my grandchildren. 

337
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,350
 Leave if you understand me! I cannot bear to see you! 

338
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,770
 How could you tell me to... 

339
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,930
 leave my children? 

340
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,510
 Please let me take the children with me. 

341
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,080
 What are you talking about? 

342
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:20,300
 Are you really trying to cut off the Woorim family's bloodline? 

343
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,810
 I will die if you tell me to. 

344
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,880
 Rather than leaving them behind, 

345
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,840
 I would rather... 

346
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,850
 I would rather follow Sa Do. 

347
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,680
 Father, please... 

348
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,930
 Yoon Bok will do his duty for the village. 

349
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,980
 Father! 

350
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,700
 I cannot. Please... 

351
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,040
 I cannot! 

352
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,940
 I will be generous and let you leave with Yi Bok. 

353
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,320
 Do not ever look for or think of Yoon Bok. 

354
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,390
 You will have to keep that in mind. 

355
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,980
 That is why I had to leave you behind alone 

356
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,740
 and leave with your sister. 

357
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,160
 Let me see him just once. 

358
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,960
 Let me see my Yoon Bok just once. 

359
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,160
 My apologies, Madam. 

360
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,760
 Master told me never to let you in. 

361
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,860
 Stop coming here. 

362
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,200
 Father... 

363
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,750
 When I think about my son, who died so tragically, 

364
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,210
 I can never forgive you, 

365
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,210
 but I cannot stop your maternal love. 

366
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,260
 Once Yoon Bok inherits his duty, 

367
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,050
 I will bring you back, then. So... 

368
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,680
 promise me you will not tempt Yoon Bok and 

369
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,070
 live far away as if you do not exist. 

370
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,500
 But— 

371
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,150
 If you cannot accept that, do not even dream of 

372
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,620
 seeing Yoon Bok even til the day you die. 

373
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,280
 That is why... 

374
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,770
 I had to lose you... 

375
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,500
 in order to get you back. 

376
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,520
 Enjoy. 

377
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,650
 Welcome. 

378
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,620
 Is there someone named Pi Hye Won here, by chance? 

379
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,030
 A student in a school uniform and gat is here. 

380
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,640
 Please tell him there's no such person. 

381
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,340
 Wait! Where are you going? 

382
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,590
 Yoon Bok... 

383
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,760
 I'm sorry. 

384
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,640
 It's my fault. 

385
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,560
 It's my fault. 

386
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
 Yoon Bok... 

387
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,370
 Yoon Bok... 

388
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,600
 In the end, 

389
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,740
 I was punished for leaving you behind. 

390
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,290
 She got over the critical state, 

391
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,090
 but she's in a very serious condition. 

392
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,670
 More than dying... 

393
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,950
 I was more afraid of leaving without 

394
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,780
 asking you for forgiveness. 

395
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,790
 Yi Bok, 

396
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,800
 make sure to find Yoon Bok. 

397
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,520
 Find him... 

398
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,760
 and stay by his side. 

399
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,150
 I will. 

400
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:02,490
 I'll stay by his side even if he doesn't want me to. 

401
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,600
 You don't have to forgive this foolish mom. 

402
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:28,060
 But I hope you don't hate your only sister, Yi Bok. 

403
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,880
 My son, 

404
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,470
 Yoon Bok. 

405
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,310
 I wish I get to see your face for one last time. 

406
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,670
 I cannot forgive you, Mother. 

407
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,690
 That is why I will... 

408
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,500
 abandon you this time. 

409
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,500
 You must've suffered so much all this time. 

410
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,760
 You must've felt so lonely. 

411
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,300
 I'll take all of your pain and loneliness with me. 

412
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,360
 Take down the wall you built because of me, 

413
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,080
 and I hope you love freely 

414
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,050
 and enjoy the things you like all you want. 

415
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:40,500
 I'm ashamed to even call your name. My son, Yoon Bok. 

416
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,710
 Although I've been a poor mother, 

417
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,750
 my heart has always been by your side. 

418
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,440
 Son, 

419
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,350
 I love you. 

420
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,580
 I mean... 

421
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,260
 I loved you. 

422
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,490
Mother...

423
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,440
Camille is staying in the village?

424
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,370
I might be the leader of the village,

425
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,760
but I cannot force the villagers to open up the village.

426
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,080
If she considers the village only as a stage for her show for commercial reasons,

427
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,240
she will never get the villagers to be on board.

428
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,350
That is why I gave her a chance for her to persuade the villagers.

429
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,880
 What is wrong, Young Master? 

430
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,120
What are you doing?

431
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,200
How could you have done that?

432
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,450
I have a guest. Behave yourself.

433
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,460
Why did you tell me a lie?

434
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,460
You said, my mother...

435
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,440
abandoned me.

436
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,440
Sir, I'll get going now.

437
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,580
Telling the truth would not have changed anything.

438
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,630
You still should have told me the truth.

439
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,970
Do you know how I felt then?

440
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,630
 99. 

441
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,530
I thought I was left alone in this world.

442
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,660
Hoping that it is a prank,

443
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,170
I fell asleep every night counting numbers.

444
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,810
The ones I loved the most...

445
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,560
After the people I believed to have loved me the most left,

446
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,920
I could not love or...

447
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,900
believe anyone.

448
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,580
You are not the only one who lost your family.

449
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,480
I lost my son, too!

450
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,280
So, after I lost my father,

451
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,950
you took away my mother and sister, too?

452
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,560
You knew I visited Mother, too. How could you...

453
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,290
How could you be so cruel to me?

454
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,710
Because I did not want you to waver.

455
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,260
You are destined to lead this village in the future—

456
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,080
That stupid destiny!

457
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,700
I will put that behind me now.

458
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,590
If splitting up my family

459
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,910
and not being with my mother in her last moment is my destiny,

460
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,990
I will reject it now.

461
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:10,570
Y-Young Master, what do you mean by that?

462
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,700
Last moment?

463
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,590
Did Madam, by chance...

464
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,670
Not only did I not send her off,

465
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,730
I became the worst son who blamed her until the very end.

466
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,500
She wanted to see me so badly.

467
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,040
I really...

468
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,410
regret it so much that I might lose my mind.

469
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,860
I will no longer live like this anymore.

470
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,600
W-What do you mean...

471
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,020
by that?

472
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,840
I will free myself...

473
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,830
from preserving tradition, inheriting the village, or getting married.

474
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,180
I will not do anything you planned for me.

475
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,970
Like Mother said,

476
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,440
I will do what I want to do...

477
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,820
and live freely.

478
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,530
Young Master! Young Master!

479
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Goodness! Master! Master!

480
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,200
Is he home?

481
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,870
Yoon Bok.

482
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,140
Yoon Bok!

483
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,060
Yoon Bok, are you home?

484
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,050
I'm coming in. Okay?

485
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,230
Yoon Bok.

486
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,980
Did he go somewhere?

487
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,280
   

488
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,380
It's pouring.

489
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,890
Where did he go without an umbrella?

490
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,190
- Hi, Mom. 
 - Joon Ho.

491
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,770
Go see Young Master.

492
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,650
Yoon Bok?

493
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,000
I heard Madam passed away.

494
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,880
 I have a situation at home. 

495
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,360
 I'm sorry. 

496
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,950
 Father! 

497
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,740
 I cannot. Please... 

498
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,930
 Do not ever look for or think of Yoon Bok. 

499
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,420
 I did not realize my cruel words... 

500
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,750
 would actually come true. 

501
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:15,310
 You must have blamed your father-in-law 

502
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:18,480
 for forcing you to leave your son. 

503
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,460
 I am sorry... 

504
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,060
 my daughter-in-law. 

505
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,730
 She is all grown up. 

506
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,080
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

507
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,150
♫  Even after closing my eyes  ♫

508
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:31,040
♫  Even the faintest memories and nervous feelings that were left behind  ♫

509
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,250
♫  Everything was you  ♫

510
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:41,310
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

511
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:46,320
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

512
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:52,590
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

513
00:57:52,590 --> 00:58:02,890
♫  I wonder if you're also under the same night sky  ♫

514
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:12,250
♫  I looked for you everywhere that night but you were nowhere in sight  ♫

515
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,950
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

516
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:21,860
♫  I met someone who resembles you  ♫

517
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,300
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫

518
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,190
Were you...

519
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,280
waiting for me?

520
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,940
Huh? Oh...

521
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,670
I was worried because it was pouring rain.

522
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,350
I didn't wait that long.

523
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:46,420
♫  Even in my dreams, meet me one last  ♫

524
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,740
Today must've been so difficult for you. Hurry home now.

525
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,780
Oh, take this.

526
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,270
Use the umbrella. Don't catch a cold again.

527
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,190
I am okay.

528
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,330
I'll run. Take your time.

529
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,400
I'm off now.

530
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:24,950


531
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,210
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

532
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:35,420
♫  I met someone who resembles you  ♫

533
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,810
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫

534
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:46,900
♫  When I hold you in my arms  ♫

535
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:55,500
♫  Will you say, "It's been a while," and hug me with a smile?  ♫

536
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,690
♫  Even in my dreams, meet me one last  ♫

537
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,480
♫  Meet me one last  ♫

538
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:17,000
   

539
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,030
Where was the bathroom again?

540
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,110
Madam Yeoju!

541
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,930
Madam Yeoju!

542
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:15,200
Madam Yeoju!

543
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,640
♫  For me, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

544
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,130
   

545
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,620
 Yoon Bok changed. 

546
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,030
 By chance, does Yoon Bok really like me? 

547
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,420
 I do not think so. 

548
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,230
 One can do that out of respect alone. 

549
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,350
 You must be mistaken. 

550
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:40,130
 Am I fooling myself because I like Yoon Bok so much? 

551
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,400
 Please do not leave. 

552
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,100
♫  Waited for me like a tall tree  ♫

553
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,880
♫  Just thinking about it warms me up  ♫
