1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,430
   

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,090
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,700
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,550
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,240
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,970
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:29,770
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,310
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,090
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,900
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:53,280


12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,020
Well, Yoon Bok...

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,540
I'm not sure what you think of me,

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,760
but I...

15
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,360
I like you.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,400
That's fine.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,170
What?

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,940
You can think more before you answer.

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,290
I think I would be okay.

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,930
Are you really okay?

21
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,850
Yes.

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,060
By the way, Yoon Bok,

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,270
can we face each other while talking about stuff like this?

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,450
I cannot dare to share a table with my teacher.

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,130
Why would you say that in this day and age?

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,830
And what do you mean a teacher?

27
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,540
I was just an academy lecturer briefly.

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,240
Not at all.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,420
Your teaching was much deeper than any others.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,370
No, no.

31
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,660
I don't want to be a teacher.

32
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,910
I like you as a man.

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,730
That's okay.

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,830
No, it's not okay at all.

35
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,820
I said I like you.

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,700
Ma'am, please take the aggressive proposal somewhere else.

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,280
I like you. I love you.

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,160
- I'm fine. 
 - What?

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,560
- I love you. 
 - I'm okay.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,350
- I love you. 
 - I'm okay.

41
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,500
- I love you. 
 - I'm okay.

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,270
I like you! I...

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,690
Yoon Bok, could you please stop rejecting so strongly?

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,210
I cannot do that.

45
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,460
I've said this already, but I'm really okay.

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,350
Stop! Please stop!

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,730
Stop!

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,080
Teacher!

49
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,750
 What's with this predictable and sad story arc? 

50
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,640
I had to grab it because I couldn't touch your body.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,240
Please forgive me for behaving rudely.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,480
Let me fix your clothes for you.

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,170
 I'm Kim Hong Do. A 30-year-old 

54
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,140
 with a crush on the 24-year-old, Shin Yoon Bok. 

55
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,520
 He only thinks of me as his teacher. 

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,970
Yoon Bok, I beg you.

57
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,680
Please stop being so polite to me!

58
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,670
   

59
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,070
 - 450 million won. 
 - Yes. 

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,620
 We'll raise 50 million and make it 500 million. 

61
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,650
Five hundred million won, anyone?

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,540
Five hundred million?

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,050
Five hundred million! Five hundred million won.

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,420
Anyone with a higher bid?

65
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,450
This is the final call. I'll say it three times.

66
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,340
Five hundred million. Five hundred million. Five hundred million!

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,130
Sold!

68
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,020
Finally, the highlight of today's auction has come.

69
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,500
The whole country was in an uproar because this went missing recently.

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,880
This is that very object.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,450
It's a cultural heritage designated by Korea.

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,570
It depicts the four seasons in the Joseon era and the scholars vividly.

73
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,050
It's an eight-fold screen with Danwon Kim Hong Do's

74
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,550
Cultural Landscape in Four Seasons!

75
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,080
We'll start at two billion won, then.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,570
Two billion won. 2.1 billion.

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,790
We got 2.1 billion won.

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,790
We got 3.4 billion. 3.5 billion?

79
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,380
3.5 billion, anyone?

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,320
3.5 billion! We got 3.5 billion.

81
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,430
We'll raise half a billion at a time. Four billion?

82
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,600
- I think there's a bit of a problem. 
 - Four billion?

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,410
We got four billion! Four billion. Any higher bid?

84
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,230
The final bidding price will be four billion.

85
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,640
This is the final triple call.

86
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,500
Four billion. Four billion. Four billion.

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,250
Sold at four billion!

88
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,000
Come in!

89
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,600
What's that?

90
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,280
Hito.

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,620
Hito, start.

92
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,190
Hello, everyone.

93
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,880
Who are you?

94
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,620
I heard some lawless people steal the country's

95
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,140
precious cultural heritage and sell secretly, so I stopped by.

96
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,180
Do you...

97
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,070
buy or sell?

98
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,750
Or...

99
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,970
do you steal?

100
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,850
What's he saying?

101
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,640
I will give you a chance to come clean if it was a mistake.

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,620
Hurry up and turn yourself in.

103
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,250
F*** you, bitch.

104
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,360
What the f*** are you saying, f***er?

105
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,150
You do not have any manners.

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,510
Are you running away?

107
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,400
Manners...

108
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,950
make...

109
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,870
a person.

110
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,640
From now on, I will teach you how to be human.

111
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,140
What's this? Who the hell!

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,160
Geez, hey.

113
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,490
Don't come.

114
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,160
Don't come, you bastard.

115
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,620
Drop your weapons.

116
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,100
Surrender quickly.

117
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,580
Go!

118
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,790
By the way, who was wearing a traditional overcoat down there?

119
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,640
To catch thieves who steal cultural heritage like you,

120
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,410
he came from Seongsan Village.

121
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,250
Seongsan Village? Wow.

122
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,670
   

123
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,660
 The most special place in Korea. 

124
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,250
 Many people visit this place, but no one has actually been here. 

125
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,310
One, two.

126
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,300
 Past the outskirts of the village where fun traditional music and performance is... 

127
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,180
 and go through the Seongsan Gate, where the gatekeepers are keeping guard, 

128
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,130
 you arrive at Korea's little Joseon in the 21st century, 

129
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,980
 Seongsan Village. 

130
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,010
 The people in Seongsan Village distance themselves from modern culture 

131
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,930
 and maintain the Joseon era's aesthetics and lifestyle. 

132
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,600
Hello.

133
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,960
Don't run.

134
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,550
- Hello. 
 - Yes, yes.

135
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,480
Hello.

136
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,580
 The real Joseon that maintained itself amidst ups and downs throughout history. 

137
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,080
 And I'm the central figure of this historical village and the villagers' anchor. 

138
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,410
   

139
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,120
 I'm the 28th offspring of the Woorim Shin family, 

140
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,130
 Shin Yoon Bok. 

141
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,680
How have you been?

142
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,220
   

143
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,080
   

144
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,070
 Danwon's painting almost got smuggled overseas? 

145
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,190
It's horrific just to think about it.

146
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,150
Young Master Yoon Bok made a great accomplishment once again.

147
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,660
Countless cultural heritages of ours have been stolen over the past three years.

148
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,570
We cannot relax until we catch all the thieves.

149
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,810
If it wasn't for the Woorim Family's help for generations,

150
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,570
it would've been difficult to save the ones we have.

151
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,310
I'm ashamed to face you and the people as the head of the Cultural Heritage Administration.

152
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,470
There are always scoundrels who want our treasures inside and outside the country.

153
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,490
Is it not such a tragedy?

154
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,000
By the way,

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,800
how did you find out there was an illegal auction in the countryside like that?

156
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,570
 Grandfather, this is Yoon Bok. 

157
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,720
Yes, come on in.

158
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,520
What? A counterfeit?

159
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,020
Yes.

160
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,420
 The painting I retrieved was a well-made counterfeit. 

161
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,500
 If so, was it that man? 

162
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,050
Yes, considering the impressive quality of the counterfeit,

163
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,240
it had to be Gamjjok. 
  (Means "like a charm") 

164
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,110
Did you find out his whereabouts?

165
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,840
 I saw the route he was exiting. 

166
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,750
 I will make sure to catch that man this time. 

167
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,800
 [Pyeontaek, Seoul, Ilgok 

168
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,550
 So, where was he headed? 

169
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,450
I think he went to Seoul.

170
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,680
I have come this far chasing him for a long time.

171
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,490
He is getting more and more daring and reckless.

172
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,100
We will have to catch him and end the thievery once and for all.

173
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,790
I feel bad sending you somewhere dangerous alone.

174
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,270
But this is the fate of you and I.

175
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,460
Our ancestors ordered us to protect the old.

176
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,980
Make sure to catch Gamjjok and return safely.

177
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,560
I will.

178
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,440
Your martial arts skills improved a lot.

179
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,110
You are too generous, Young Master.

180
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,230
Let us be on our way if you are ready.

181
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,670
Okay.

182
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,280
 Yeojudaek. 

183
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,550
Yes.

184
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,730
Young Master, I packed sweet potatoes and shikhye.

185
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,920
Have some when you get hungry on the way.

186
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,050
You should have them, too.

187
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,740
Your back hurts. You should not have.

188
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,390
Thank you. I will enjoy them.

189
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,960
Do not skip meals when you are in Seoul.

190
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,360
You are nagging again.

191
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,690
Make sure to sleep somewhere warm.

192
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,940
Yoon Ah, protect him when something dangerous happens as his bodyguard.

193
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,660
Be careful whenever and wherever. Okay?

194
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,730
- Come on, I said I can manage things myself. 
 - Gosh...

195
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,830
Do not worry, ma'am.

196
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,460
I will stay alert and protect him well.

197
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,200
Gosh, people might think I am going somewhere far away.

198
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,570
There, there.

199
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,300
I will listen to you, and I will always be careful.

200
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,690
Do not worry about a thing.

201
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:41,090
I will return before you start wondering how I am.

202
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,570
Let us go.

203
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,450
Go inside now.

204
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,300
Please be careful!

205
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,100
- Go inside. 
 - Gosh.

206
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
Is it because I raised him myself?

207
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,450
Why do I keep crying like a fool?

208
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,810
Senior.

209
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,420
Shit! Hot!

210
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,830
I think I said iced Americano,

211
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,710
not the freaking hot Americano.

212
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,840
That's exactly it.

213
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,730
What?

214
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,440
I brought ice separately.

215
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,400
Here.

216
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,110
Ice.

217
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,740
Iced.

218
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,720
Why didn't you say so earlier?

219
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,070
What a treasure you are.

220
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,830
Gosh, how refreshing.

221
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,460
What should I wear today?

222
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,740
Senior, come this way.

223
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,040
These are the outfits for the shoot today.

224
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,030
You can wear them in this order.

225
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,750
Thank you, maid.

226
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,170
I'll see myself out.

227
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,490
Bye.

228
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,930
 In the glamorous fashion world, I'm... 

229
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,210
 literally the maid. 

230
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,250
 The bottom of the pyramid who hasn't debuted yet, 

231
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,410
 a designer's assistant. 

232
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,850
Welcome.

233
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,460
 Above me, 

234
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,050
 there's someone who always supports me... 

235
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,300
   

236
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,590
    
 I mean, who always drags me down, the designer.

237
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,670
Unni!

238
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,920
Did you lose weight?

239
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,060
Your proportions are insane.

240
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,900
Do you not gain weight at all?

241
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,320
   

242
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,770
 Above the designer, 

243
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,370
 there's the celebrity who makes the designer shine.  
    

244
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,830
 Lastly, 

245
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,190
 on the very top of the pyramid, 

246
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,680
 it's the unapproachable top of the top in the industry. 

247
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,770
Camille?

248
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,740
 Even the celebrities are desperate to have it. 

249
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,400
 It's not just fashion. 

250
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,010
- This is art. 
  - It's called art. 

251
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,350
 There are the premium high fashion designers. 

252
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,820
 This tiny triangle is all of our desire, 

253
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,580
 and my dream. 

254
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,560
I've wanted this purse so badly.

255
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,010
 She's asking for it. 

256
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,320
I had to bribe the shop manager so much to get it.

257
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,200
She agreed to give it to me since I spent tens of millions and insisted.

258
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,620
 That means she doesn't want to. 

259
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,180
Why are the clothes so tight?

260
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,390
So annoying.

261
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,420
What? Which part is uncomfortable?

262
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,450
Why are the clothes so tight?

263
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,250
So annoying.

264
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,100
Let me help you.

265
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,940
One, two, three!

266
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,580
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

267
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,570
I can't do the shoot because the clothes are uncomfortable.

268
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,870
Are you okay? Gosh.

269
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,320
Shit.

270
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,850
Unni, you can't leave like that.

271
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,040
You've got to be kidding me.

272
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,980
 This cruel world doesn't care about someone like me. 

273
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,270
 The reason I'm able to endure it is... 

274
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,150
Do Yeong.

275
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,000
Where's Gi Yeong? Isn't she here yet?

276
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,370
She left.

277
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,660
- Why? 
 - Let's just go to the strategy meeting.

278
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Hold on a second.

279
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,510
Could you check the lines from the promotional material?

280
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,060
Yes.

281
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,690
Wait for me.

282
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,940
   

283
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
 This is how I'm enduring another day. 

284
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,880
Gosh, you brought food again?

285
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,450
Whenever I tell people about this,

286
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,050
no one believes me.

287
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,070
What cheapskate packs leftovers?

288
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,610
You're legendary. Legendary.

289
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,820
No one even touched it since the shoot got canceled. Okay?

290
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,520
Sis, I'm a cartoon artist.

291
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,900
I need protein to work all night.

292
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,980
- You should bring meat sometimes— 
 - Meat, my foot.

293
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,090
Thanks for the meal.

294
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,610
Oh, no.

295
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,700
Gosh, it's happening again.

296
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,430
I can't let you go like this.

297
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,710
You're Mom's only belonging that's left.

298
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,460
You need to go to Paris with me.

299
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,620
Gosh, this fly. I can't even catch it. 
  (Same pronunciation as Paris) 

300
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,560
I'm making money enduring horrible treatment,

301
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,710
but if I win that thing, 
    

302
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,300
    
 I'll get picked by Camille

303
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,580
and become a Parisienne immediately.

304
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,000
So, you mean Steven Spielberg just needs to like

305
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,140
my webtoon, out of a sea of webtoons. Right?

306
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,680
- That's right. 
 - How will that happen?

307
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,690
You little. It will, okay?

308
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,000
Just shut up and eat.

309
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,270
Please, baby. One more time. Here we go.

310
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,750
Here we go!

311
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,130
Wow, it's working. It's working.

312
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,820
Look at this. Isn't it pretty?

313
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,840
You'd have a lot of followers if it were.

314
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,890
It just hasn't shined yet.

315
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,270
This is my portfolio...

316
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,630
and the investment for my future.

317
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,790
Look at this. Someone liked it already.

318
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,080
Boksoon? Isn't it a scammer?

319
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,350
Don't talk about my fan like that.

320
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,730
   

321
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,830
"This pouch is so cute.

322
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,340
It's beautiful.

323
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,840
Although the string part is kind of boring."

324
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,690
I told you, it's a scammer.

325
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,240
Is it boring?

326
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,900
No, no. It's perfect.

327
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,220
It's perfect for my tablet.

328
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,480
Put it down.

329
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,780
It's for someone else. Okay?

330
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,940
   

331
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,320
Could it be...

332
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,270
Sis, let me tell you something seriously.

333
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,450
Men prefer a designer product over a one-of-a-kind handmade one.

334
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,260
You think all men are like you?

335
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,090
He's different.

336
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,960
He prefers handmade products over designer goods.

337
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,610
 Happy birthday. 

338
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,050
 Happy birthday! 

339
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,670
How did you know I like Camille, Hyang Gi?

340
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,420
Who doesn't like Camille?

341
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,830
You just can't get it because it's expensive.

342
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,070
Privileged people are definitely on another level.

343
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,910
My birthday is next month.

344
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,450
Seriously.

345
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,400
Thank you so much. I'll cherish this.

346
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,270
Here.

347
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,530
You finished this already?

348
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,370
Ta-da.

349
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,150
Happy birthday.

350
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,870
Did you make this yourself?

351
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,340
Yes, it's nothing compared to Camille,

352
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,370
but it's a one-of-a-kind item.

353
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,550
Hong Do, you're my treasure.

354
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,340
- Go in here right now. 
 - Hey...

355
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,820
Let me carry you in here.

356
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,470
- Go in there. 
 - Come on.

357
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,350
Do Yeong.

358
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,680
What are you doing here?

359
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm stretching.

360
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,770
What's that?

361
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,950
I found it here.

362
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,020
Did someone leave it?

363
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,310
   

364
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,490
Young Master, Detective Park found out where Gamjjok is.

365
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,110
That's great.

366
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,430
Request a meeting as soon as we arrive in Seoul.

367
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,020
Okay.

368
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,820
We cannot let that lawless man take our precious cultural heritage.

369
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,690
We need to move quickly.

370
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,490
   

371
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,330
What are you crying so sadly?

372
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,240
My bag is gone.

373
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,960
My mom, who's working in Seoul, is sick.

374
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,290
So I need to get there quickly.

375
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,300
Take this.

376
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,910
Helping someone in distress...

377
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,370
and offering kindness is a scholar's duty.

378
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,860
I learned that from my ancestors.

379
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,310
So, if you find someone in distress in the future,

380
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,990
do exactly as I did.

381
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,530
Thank you.

382
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,240
It's almost time to board. Get going now.

383
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,530
Okay, thank you.

384
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:46,190
But, Young Master, the next bus leaves in about an hour.

385
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:56,100
If so, let's have a coffee nearby for an hour.

386
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,980
Okay.

387
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,050
I would like to order.

388
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,120
Please order at the kiosk.

389
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,670
Ki.. Kios...

390
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,090
It's over there. Please order at the kiosk.

391
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,990
Okay.

392
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,060
Gosh, the world is changing quickly.

393
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:29,320
I heard something called AI is replacing people in the outside world.

394
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,350
This must be an AI that takes orders.

395
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,050
I will try ordering first.

396
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,310
Watch carefully and copy me.

397
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,960
Okay.

398
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,700
One iced Americano, please.

399
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,690
Does the AI have difficulty hearing?

400
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,660
One iced Americano.

401
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,560
Excuse me, Mr. AI, can you not hear me?

402
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,460
- Iced— 
  - Hello, Customer. Please choose an order method. 

403
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,250
O-Order...

404
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,270
   

405
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,080
I-c-e-d—

406
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,760
I think you do it like this, Young Master.

407
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,800
The machine cannot seem to totally replace humans.

408
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,050
No, not yet.

409
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,750
You should pick a drink, too.

410
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,510
Okay. I will...

411
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,200
Iced Americano?

412
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
- Yes, the coffee. 
 - Okay.

413
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,510
- W-With extra ice. 
 - Extra ice. Got it.

414
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,370
I was thinking of getting a used one, but it's too expensive.

415
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,580
   

416
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,400
What? Camille?

417
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,510
Who puts a Camille in a used market?

418
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,710
500,000 is less than a quarter.

419
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,300
It's for men.

420
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,930
 How did you know I like Camille, Hyang Gi? 

421
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,480
 Is the price negotiable? 

422
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,070
It has been a while since you were in Seoul.

423
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,720
It has been a while.

424
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,220
He is waiting. Let us hurry.

425
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,670
Yes.

426
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,680
   

427
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,820
Young Master.

428
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,910
We confirmed he was moving a box through a nearby CCTV.

429
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,850
If you check if the authentic piece is in there,

430
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,140
we'll be there.

431
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,980
All right.

432
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,160
- Me? 
 - You two, skip the line!

433
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,480
They're giving us special treatment since we're from Seongsan Village.

434
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,450
Let us go there.

435
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,710
Excuse me for a moment.

436
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,300
I am sorry. Excuse me.

437
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,050
They called us. Please excuse us.

438
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,300
I am sorry. Excuse me.

439
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,940
I am sorry. Excuse me.

440
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,620
You came first. I am sorry.

441
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,860
Silly me.

442
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,120
   

443
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,140
What's this?

444
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,630
I am Shin Yoon Bok,

445
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,290
Woorim Shin family's 28th offspring from Seongsan Village.

446
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,040
Oh, you're from Seongsan Village.

447
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,730
That is correct. Excuse me for a second.

448
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,660
Nope.

449
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,610
What is wrong?

450
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,910
This place is far from scholars or Confucious philosophy.

451
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,200
This outfit...

452
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,310
Please leave now.

453
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,800
Come on now.

454
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,250
You gestured for me to come over.

455
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,340
You saw it, too, Yoon Ah.

456
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,860
Y-Yoon Ah...

457
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,250
What is with the improper outfit?

458
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,000
If I had to undress and get changed a hundred times

459
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,170
to catch that man...

460
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,560
I am willing to do it countless times.

461
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,620
You look great.

462
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,340
Okay, go in.

463
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,670
Allow me to take a look inside alone this time.

464
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,980
W-Wait, Yoon Ah!

465
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,120
Okay.

466
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,010
I will leave.

467
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,210
I am sorry.

468
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,520
I am sorry.

469
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,150
I am sorry. Excuse me.

470
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,980
I am sorry.

471
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,120
   

472
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,120
Let's go get a refund.

473
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,490
Why? You don't like it?

474
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,570
Hong Do, all I need is you.

475
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,270
You're my gift, I said.

476
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,120
Really?

477
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,650
Really?

478
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,650
I should throw it away, then. It's Camille.

479
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,840
What?

480
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,270
You don't need this gift.

481
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,750
- I'll just throw it away, then. 
 - Hey.

482
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,050
I'll wear it.

483
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,380
I'll wear it, I said.

484
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll really cherish it.

485
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,970
Only when I meet you.

486
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,350
Let's go get food.

487
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,870
I'll treat you to a full course tonight.

488
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,650
Hold on. Let me call my mom first.

489
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,060
Why? Did you plan a dinner with your family?

490
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,730
Come on. Did you make another plan again?

491
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,780
Sorry, sorry. I can tell her I can't go. Just one sec.

492
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,850
No, no.

493
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,900
I'll give you a pass since it's your birthday.

494
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,950
I won't yield next time.

495
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,750
Thank you.

496
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,780
Get going. They must be waiting.

497
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,140
- I'll call you later. 
 - Okay.

498
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,990
   

499
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,480
   

500
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,550
Are you enjoying the food?

501
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,490
- Yes. 
 - Great, enjoy.

502
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,590
Let me help them.

503
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,090
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

504
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,940
Looks like it's your first time here.

505
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,700
Yes.

506
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:17,260
This is called Seolyamyeokjeok. Noblemen in the Joseon era used to enjoy it on winter nights.

507
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,030
If you cook in a fire and cool in cold snow three times,

508
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,390
the juice gets coated perfectly

509
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,400
and the moment you chew, it melts in your mouth.

510
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,920
It's one of the rarest treats.

511
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,640
Here you go.

512
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,470
Thank you.

513
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,210
Is it because noblemen used to eat it? It tastes...

514
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,820
Please enjoy your time here, then.

515
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,950
Thank you.

516
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,490
Wow, he's so charismatic.

517
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,630
Famous restaurants are different for a reason.

518
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,680
Right, you said it's Do Yeong's birthday.

519
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,730
Why me, then...

520
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,330
Wow, it's tasty.

521
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,190
What kind of place is a club?

522
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,010
Why do they not allow this attire?

523
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,810
Young Master!

524
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,790
How did it go?

525
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,230
I scoured the club for over an hour,

526
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,450
but I did not witness anything suspicious.

527
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,870
But there is a place I did not get to check.

528
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,150
It is called a "VIP-only zone."

529
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,280
I attempted to enter,

530
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,130
but they stopped me, saying not just anyone can enter.

531
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,240
VIP?

532
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,390
What kind of people enter that place?

533
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,810
Well, they were being called "Jookdori."

534
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,980
Jookdori?

535
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:20,670
Yes. They call the regulars who come so often that they wear out the threshold.

536
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:25,360
If so, I will have to become a Jookdori.

537
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,170
Yes.

538
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,770
Pardon?

539
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,380
Okay.

540
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,480
If so, I will quickly look for a lodging.

541
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,370
I will do it.

542
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,050
An old friend of mine lives nearby.

543
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,720
He will be able to help us.

544
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,300
- How do you turn this on? 
 - Well...

545
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,440
- Right here. 
 - Okay.

546
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,020
I'm getting drunk.

547
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,990
Yes, hello?

548
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,580
We'll have another bottle of soju.

549
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,180
Thank you.

550
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,880
This is a really famous place.

551
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,930
I wanted to treat you on your birthday, Hon.

552
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,070
 - Huh? This voice is...  
 - How many times did I tell you?

553
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,660
You're my gift, I said.

554
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,870
 Could it be Lee Do Yeong? 

555
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,220
 What are they doing here? 

556
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,630
- Camille? 
 - It was a major purchase.

557
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,480
 - What?  
 - You're a luxury good yourself.

558
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,440
I wanted to be a man at your level.

559
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,960
 Is he... 

560
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,190
Looks great.

561
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,620
 ...two-timing? 

562
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,550
Should I take this off?

563
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,120
 No way. 

564
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,970
 No, no. 

565
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,130
 Calm down. Calm down. 

566
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,560
 This is a dream. 

567
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,680
What? What?

568
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,890
 It isn't. 

569
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,230
 It's reality. 

570
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,430
Babe, s-should we go somewhere else?

571
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,630
Shall we?

572
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,860
 You two... 

573
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,370
 Spiraling. I'm spiraling. 

574
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,340
Hong Do, could you pretend you didn't see us?

575
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,000
 What? 

576
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,550
Do Yeong and I...

577
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
are dating secretly.

578
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,520
 Dating secretly? 

579
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,550
Well, l-let's go.

580
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,740
Lee Do Yeong.

581
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,480
What's this?

582
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,710
- Take it off. 
 - What?

583
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,400
This shirt. Take it off.

584
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,700
Gosh, what are you doing, Hong Do?

585
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,690
How could you do this to me?

586
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,770
You, out of all people?

587
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,430
You can't do this to me.

588
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,900
You can't look down on me, too!

589
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,160
Let go, Ms. Kim Hong Do!

590
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,280
Go to bed if you're drunk. Okay?

591
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,690
Let's go.

592
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,830
What's this? What's wrong with Hong Do?

593
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,930
I don't know. Alcohol must've driven her crazy.

594
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,740
Let's go. Let's go, Hyang Gi.

595
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,010
Take it off! Take it off, I said!

596
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,950
- What are you doing? 
 - What's wrong, Hong Do?

597
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,280
Let go and talk instead. Let's talk!

598
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,750
Let go, you crazy woman!

599
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,880
 I want to ask sincerely. 

600
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,740
 Why does everyone treat me so rudely? 

601
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,390
Are you okay?

602
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,790
 Are you okay? 

603
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,670
I think...

604
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,460
I had a sad...

605
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,590
and beautiful dream just now.

606
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,940
Gosh, I'm late!

607
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,760
What's going on?

608
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,960
What's wrong with me?

609
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,830
They're clasping their hands?

610
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,430
What? What?

611
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,280
You make such a great couple.

612
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,260
- Seriously, amazing. 
 - I knew it.

613
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,550
It was suspicious when she gifted him the Camille.

614
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,200
Were you dating all this time?

615
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,940
Who confessed their love first?

616
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,870
When? Where? How?

617
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,550
On the last day of the previous season, Do Yeong...

618
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,170
- Oh my god! 
 - Previous season?

619
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,680
It's been three months?

620
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,380
Wow, I feel so betrayed, Hyang Gi.

621
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,450
Amazing. You make a great couple.

622
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,060
It's so dusty.

623
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,750
Gosh, why is it so dirty?

624
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,070
What are you doing?

625
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,130
There's a big piece of trash here.

626
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,210
What are you doing?

627
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,580
Hong Do, are you still drunk?

628
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,230
Aren't you taking it too far?

629
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,050
People don't throw a tantrum for no reason.

630
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,610
Sounds like you have a reason.

631
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,360
Of course, there is. The thing is—

632
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,310
Gosh, seriously.

633
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,150
Are you okay? Let me see.

634
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,350
I'm okay, Hyang Gi.

635
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,850
It's dangerous. Go over there.

636
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,680
Don't touch it.

637
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,940
Hyang Gi, you need more caffeine. Right?

638
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,480
Should I get you coffee? No, no.

639
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,920
I'll treat my team with coffee today!

640
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,590
Let's go! I'm serious!

641
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,100
Let's go, Team Leader! Let's go!

642
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,830
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

643
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,340
Here we go!

644
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,950
Wait...

645
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,080
That asshole...

646
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,720
I decorated it in a hurry since your friend recommended this place.

647
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,660
But you should move somewhere more comfortable—

648
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,040
It is okay.

649
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,390
I like it. Do not worry.

650
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,360
This is a thing that heats up food, is it not?

651
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,750
Yes, that is correct.

652
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,560
Would you be okay?

653
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,670
I am okay.

654
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,520
   

655
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,810
    
 My gosh! Why did you bring so much?

656
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,080
You've been well, right?

657
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,940
How could I not be when this is happening?

658
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,120
You've been doing so much for us.

659
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,240
I've received more from you.

660
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,510
You took me in when I had nowhere to go.

661
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:51,980
The director would've been so happy if he could see this now.

662
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,840
- Joon Ho! 
 - Do Yoon!

663
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,620
- Didn't he grow a lot? 
 - Have you been well? You grew so much.

664
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,090
How did you get so heavy?

665
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,100
You've been eating well like I told you to.

666
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,480
I had two servings.

667
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,620
Really? You had two servings?

668
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,440
What did I promise to get you if you ate well?

669
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,190
Was it this?

670
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,380
- No. 
 - No?

671
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,530
Was it this, then?

672
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,530
- No! 
 - No?

673
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,690
What was it, then?

674
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,330
Hold on.

675
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,930
- Was it this? 
 - Wow!

676
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,930
It's a scooter.

677
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,220
- Wow, you must be so happy. 
 - Thank you.

678
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,200
- Yes, ride carefully. 
 - Okay.

679
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,820
Hyung, hello!

680
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,390
- Yes, yes. Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

681
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,300
Wow, you guys grew a lot, too.

682
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,930
Could you help us with these?

683
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,220
- Yes. 
 - Okay. Move these.

684
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,560
It's so much.

685
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,550
It's heavy. Be careful. This, too.

686
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,860
   

687
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,700
I brought some food from Seongsan Hall.

688
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,860
They used the ingredients from Seongsan Village.

689
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,230
It must suit your taste.

690
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,240
- Let us eat. 
 - Okay.

691
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,610
Do not cross the line.

692
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,380
I apologize.

693
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,680
 - Where are you?  
 - Why do you care?

694
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,750
Why aren't you coming?

695
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,400
What?

696
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,930
Take this.

697
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,320
You wanted me to take it off. Happy?

698
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,130
Hey.

699
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,210
What?

700
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,240
Apologize.

701
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,420
About what?

702
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,910
You've been lying to me while seeing both Hyang Gi and me.

703
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,200
You called me crazy and insane.

704
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,190
You pushed me, and you...

705
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,450
treated me so rudely.

706
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,950
Apologize.

707
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,110
Why are you so clingy since yesterday?

708
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,310
Were we in a relationship or something?

709
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,780
What? W-We weren't in a relationship?

710
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,500
I wasn't into you.

711
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,840
I was just being nice to you.

712
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,440
What's this, then? Why did you give this to me?

713
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,500
Oh, that?

714
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,210
Because I pitied you.

715
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,000
How about the promotional material? Why did you ask me to work on it?

716
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,840
Did I ask you to?

717
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,990
How about this Camille shirt? You said you'd only wear it with me.

718
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,490
It's fake, by the way.

719
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,180
What?

720
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,250
Hyang Gi noticed it earlier.

721
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,420
Gosh, it was so embarrassing.

722
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,770
So, I'm saying...

723
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:05,140
you were a fake to me, Kim Hong Do.

724
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:11,840
And Hyang Gi is the real deal.

725
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,810
Hey, Lee Do Yeong.

726
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,860
Lee Do Yeong!

727

729
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,620
 You can't do this to me. 

730
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,710
 You can't look down on me, too! 

731
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,260
 Let go, Ms. Kim Hong Do! 

732
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,180
 You were a fake to me, Kim Hong Do. 

733
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,810
 And Hyang Gi is the real deal. 

734
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,830

738
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,370
 The number you dialed doesn't exist. 

739
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,680

Yes.

00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,700
How bitter.

766
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,330
Have you been well?

767
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:41,240
W-Who are you that you're...

768
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,820
D-Do you know me?

769
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,600
Looks like you do not remember me.

770
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,370
I guess you do look familiar.

771
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:55,170
Who are you...

772
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,480
 I'm sorry. 

773
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,950
I am your former student, Shin Yoon Bok.

774
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,660
Shin Yoon Bok?

775
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,000
That Yoon Bok who went to the webtoon academy?

776
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,950
Gosh, you're him?

777
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,230
Do you remember now?

778
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,780
Gosh, of course.

779
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,720
It's been so long.

780
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,860
Has it been seven years?

781
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,690
   

782
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:50,780
 I ran away from home at the age of 17 for the first time in my life. 

783
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,420
I'm here to be educated.

784
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,740
Look at his outfit.

785
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,410
- He's actually kind of handsome. 
 - Legendary.

786
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,350
Wow, look at him. What is he, an aristocrat?

787
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,710
 I thought my life in Seoul would be different, 

788
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,370
 but it wasn't so easy. 

789
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,330
The kid from the Seongsan Village. Isn't he kind of weird?

790
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,290
- Why would he wear the gat with the school uniform? 
 - I know. 
  (Traditional hat for men) 

791
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,810
It got in the way during a class, so I told him to take it off.

792
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:29,020
And he said, "This is my last duty as a scholar."

793
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,740
I completely lost it.

794
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,840
Gosh, Young Master!

795
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,220
What brings you to this humble place?

796
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,720
This bag... Should I call it a bojjim?

797
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,460
Let me carry that for you.

798
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,110
I deserve to die, Young Master!

799
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,830
Cut his head off immediately!

800
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:57,180
 I was nothing but a laughing stock for being different 

801
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,630
 and it made me feel small. 

802
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,330
 That was when this one person showed up. 

803
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,790
Here.

804
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,220
Shin Yoon Bok?

805
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,770
Is your name Shin Yoon Bok?

806
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,840
Yes.

807
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,880
Hello, I'm Kim Hong Do.

808
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,000
 She was the first teacher who approached me without any prejudice. 

809
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,640
 It was Ms. Kim Hong Do. 

810
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,920
Young Master, we were told to draw a family member.

811
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,530
Why draw a 1,000-won bill?

812
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:50,570
Is this old man your family, by chance?

813
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,200
How cool.

814
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,940
Your grandfather looks very distinguished.

815
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:04,190
Yoon Bok, you don't have to be embarrassed for being different.

816
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,370
Whether people like it or not,

817
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,440
you're plenty cool as you are.

818
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,050
Right?

819
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,000
Let me see.

820
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,590
You did a great job.

821
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,370
Yes, it has been a long time.

822
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,960
But what brings you here, Yoon Bok?

823
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,830
I asked a friend, and he said you would be here.

824
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:34,240
And I wanted to give you these flowers.

825
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,080
It is my gratitude as your student. Please take it.

826
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,490
Gosh, seriously.

827
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:43,670
I quit the academy so long ago.

828
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,880
I should have given you flowers every year.

829
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,090
But I am finally giving it to you now. I apologize.

830
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,140
Thank you.

831
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,840
Not at all. It is my duty as your student.

832
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,280
Thank you so much.

833
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,240
It's been so long since I was gifted flowers.

834
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,900
Oh, my. Silly me.

835
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,020
Have a seat. Have a seat. Let's sit and talk.

836
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,520
Are you okay?

837
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,060
Are you okay?

838
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,430
Take it off.

839
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,960
Take it off!

840
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,240
Take it off!

841
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,520
Teacher, you cannot do this.

842
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,410
Take it off, I said.

843
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,140
Was it you?

844
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,430
   

845
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:34,170


846
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,880
   

847
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,190
   

848
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,190
Please calm down.

849
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,140
This is a tricky situation.

850
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:10,410
What can I do to stop your tears?

851
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,420
Tell me anything.

852
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,240
What can I do to stop your tears?

853
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,000
I don't know.

854
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:33,470
Buy me flowers or something.

855
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,090
Flowers?

856
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,380
 Did you sleep well, Teacher? 

857
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,810
 What are you doing there, Yoon Bok? 

858
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,590
 Why is the teacher avoiding me like that? 

859
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:53,870
 I saw suspicious people entering the VIP room. 

860
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,850
 What? Take you where? 

861
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,820
 Why is the path of becoming a Jookdori so difficult? 

862
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,230
 Senior, did you design this yourself, by chance? 

863
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,570
 Are you asking me if I copied your design? 

864
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,410
 - Just quit your job. 
 - You quit if you feel uncomfortable at work. 

865
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,550
 I said leave, Kim Hong Do! 

866
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,620
 How dare you touch her? 

867
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:17,060
♫  The one and only person who lets me breathe  ♫
