1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
   

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,330
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,700
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,850
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,450
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,930
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,710
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,960
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,110
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,740
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,180
   

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,460
   

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,150


14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,900
Where is the Teacher?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,270
I will not...

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,200
let any of you get away.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
Hey, let's go.

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,430
Tie her up.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,270
Let go. Let go!

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,110
No!

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,600
 Let go, I said! 

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,760
What are you doing?

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Untie me right now!

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,270
Untie me!

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,580
Help me!

26
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,270
Help me!

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,080
Yoon Bok!

28
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,570
Don't blame me.

29
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm not the one who put us in this situation.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,350
That family always makes a big deal out of simple matters.

31
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,550
It's such a pity.

32
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,140
Right?

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,970
You...

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,910
I will not let you get away with it.

35
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,910
Take care of her.

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,500
Help me.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,340
Help me!

38
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,160
   

39
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,380
Teacher!

40
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,590
Yoon Bok...

41
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,410
Let us get out of here.

42
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,630
Hold on.

43
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,080
I will carry it.

44
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,930
Are you okay?

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm okay.

46
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,640
I thought something might happen to you.

47
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
It's okay.

48
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,030
You came to me like this.

49
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,750
Thank you, Yoon Bok.

50
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,850
I am sorry I made you go through something so terrible.

51
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,940
It's okay. I said it's okay.

52
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,830
Damn it...

53
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,220
 Hurry! 

54
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
 - Go! 
 - Yes, sir! 

55
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,110
There's an emergency patient.

56
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,280
 Go, go, go! 

57
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,950
Teacher, wait here for a moment.

58
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,760
Stop!

59
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,380
How could you...

60
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,500
How could you do something like this?

61
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,640
Geez, my precious money.

62
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,240
Did you do all this for something so trivial?

63
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
Did you threaten someone's life...

64
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,980
because you were blinded by some stupid money?

65
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,610
Stupid money?

66
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,360
Do you know what someone can get with money?

67
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,770
I suppose you never got the taste of money

68
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,370
in that tiny village. What would you know?

69
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,370
Even if you can conquer the world with money,

70
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,970
how could it be more precious than a person?

71
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,260
Don't act superior.

72
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,710
I'm just noticing that...

73
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,040
you look just like your father.

74
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,490
Your father said the same thing.

75
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,530
 The treasures in the village storage might be precious, 

76
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,420
 but what would be the use of them without people? 

77
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,380
 But still. What if someone steals them after you reveal them? 

78
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,180
 No. 

79
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,230
 I want to reveal the treasures in the storage when we open up the village 

80
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,850
 so people can see and feel the treasures 

81
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,650
 we inherited from our ancestors. 

82
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,810
 Since it is a good day for the village, opening to the public, 

83
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,380
 I think I will reveal the most precious thing first. 

84
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,410
 I am thinking of starting with this. What do you think? 

85
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,470
 No. 

86
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,210
 You! 

87
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,360
Seventeen years ago,

88
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,210
your father died while acting superior, too.

89
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,800
Are you the one...

90
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,250
who killed my father?

91
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,830
How dare you do that to my father—

92
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,910
Everything's been perfect thus far.

93
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,310
You bastard!

94
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,310
How dare you think so lightly of people's lives?

95
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,100
Is superficial wealth more important than people's lives?

96
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,400
You people...

97
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,880
don't understand the real world.

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,920
People's lives? That silly stuff?

99
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,170
It's nothing once it ends.

100
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,440
But money never dies.

101
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,220
Even if people die, money still lives on.

102
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,950
Generations after generations.

103
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,410
I will never forgive you.

104
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,700
Right now, I will...

105
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,030
What?

106
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,100
Will you kill me or something?

107
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,910
Can a high and mighty scholar like you kill?

108
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,330
As you said...

109
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,990
hurting a defenseless person is not how scholars behave.

110
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,490
But...

111
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,120
you've lost qualities that make you a human.

112
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,460
So, no matter what I do,

113
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,810
it will not matter.

114
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,890
You asshole!

115
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,850
You think you can say anything with that mouth of yours?

116
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,380
I'm not a scholar, and I have no dignity.

117
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,160
I have no problem beating up bastards like you. You asshole!

118
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,250
Are you two okay?

119
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,630
Lee Beom Gyo, you're under arrest for instigating murder, kidnapping, imprisonment,

120
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,190
theft of cultural heritage, and so forth.

121
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,440
You will feel it in your bones in prison for the rest of your life

122
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,150
how vain the wealth you gained by giving up being a human being was.

123
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,700
Here.

124
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,610
If it was not for me,

125
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,110
you would not have gone through this.

126
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,100
I do not know what to say.

127
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,830
What are you talking about?

128
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,800
You must be having a harder time than me.

129
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,710
I'm the one who's sorry since I can't do anything for you.

130
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,640
Teacher...

131
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,550
 There was something I really wanted to tell her. 

132
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,510
I...

133
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,800
am so sorry.

134
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,330
Let's go back now.

135
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,140
 Do you remember Gamjjok, who got caught trying to 

136
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,540
 sell the cultural heritage in the black market? 

137
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,640
 The real culprit of that case... 

138
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,160
 turns out to be the director of the Cultural Heritage Administration. 

139
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,040
 In order to steal the cultural heritage in Seongsan Village, 

140
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,890
 he even kidnapped someone, but was arrested. 

141
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,570
 The police are also investigating Director Lee 

142
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,800
 for the arson case in Seongsan Village 17 years ago. 

143
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,950
 The case 17 years ago is about to face a new chapter. 

144
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,440
Did he really...

145
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,820
do that to Sa Do?

146
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,670
Yes.

147
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,740
Apparently so.

148
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,680
All right. You may leave now.

149
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,210
Grandfather.

150
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,960
Without even knowing that was how my son died,

151
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,240
I have been keeping that man by my side.

152
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,560
Yoon Bok, I feel so terrible toward Sa Do.

153
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,390
He must have been so lonely and frustrated.

154
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Without knowing how Sa Do died,

155
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,030
I blamed you for no reason.

156
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,360
I am sorry, Daughter-in-law. 
    

157
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,950
All the truths have been revealed now.

158
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,500
So please be at peace over there.

159
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,420
I hope you are happy with...

160
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,580
Sa Do in heaven.

161
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,320
   

162
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,760
I didn't think I'd see you here, Grandfather.

163
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,990
I wanted to tell your mother how Sa Do died.

164
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,970
You must have gone through a lot because of your foolish grandfather.

165
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,500
I should not have let you and your mother go like that then.

166
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,290
I am sorry.

167
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,530
Come back to the village when you feel better.

168
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,450
I...

169
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,450
will be waiting.

170
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,500
Grandfather.

171
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,160
   

172
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,200
 But... 

173
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,020
 to me, 

174
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,730
 nothing is as precious as you. 

175
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,600
 And I never... 

176
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,990
 want to lose the one I love again. 

177
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,060
I wonder if Yoon Bok is doing well.

178
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,840
Yoon Ah, when are you coming to Seoul?

179
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,140
I ran out of story.

180
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,690
I'm struggling without my muse.

181
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,040
And I miss you, too.

182
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,270
I know.

183
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,660
 What is wrong? What is going on? 

184
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,780
 Were you going to disappear after leaving banana milk again? 

185
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,520
How could I see your sister after what I've done?

186
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,300
Let go. I have to go before she comes.

187
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,770
No! Don't go, Dad.

188
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,110
I said I'll call you again.

189
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,160
Dad!

190
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,000
What is it? Will you leave us again?

191
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,800
Hong Do.

192
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,200
Leave. And never come back.

193
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,130
I'm a fool thinking you were back for a moment.

194
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,870
Yes.

195
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,400
Forget about this shameful dad.

196
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,620
You should fly away with your wings.

197
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:43,260
I'll no longer sabotage your future.

198
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,890
Who said that?

199
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,050
Who said that I was ashamed of you?

200
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,090
Can't you just stay?

201
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,840
Don't go anywhere.

202
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,060
I don't care if you sabotage us!

203
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,870
Can't you just stay by our side?

204
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,870
Hong Do.

205
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm about to leave soon, too.

206
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,630
You need to be with Hong Hak, at least.

207
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,470
She's right.

208
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,690
Don't go, Dad.

209
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,660
Father!

210
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,620
Dad...

211
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,850
You're back.

212
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,550
Take one each, even when I'm gone.

213
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,530
I'll send you more when you run out.

214
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,330
I will be thinking of you once a day against my will.

215
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,980
Right, I have something for you, too.

216
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,270
This is...

217
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,200
I did not lock it this time.

218
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,700
I kept my heart for you closed up back then.

219
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,190
I thought keeping things closed lets you protect what is precious,

220
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,850
but I realized I was being a stubborn old man.

221
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,760
So, I am thinking of keeping this open

222
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,850
and filling it up from now on.

223
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,240
I will visit you in France once I bequeath the village.

224
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,800
Let us catch up over a glass of wine, then.

225
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,040
A glass won't be enough.

226
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,960
Let's eat.

227
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,600
Here.

228
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,030
No, you eat.

229
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,180
You're so skinny.

230
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,970
No, you eat.

231
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,950
No, you eat.

232
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,730
Gosh, I'll eat it, then.

233
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,090
All right.

234
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,350
You haven't changed since you were a kid.

235
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,670
You won't starve to death, at least.

236
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
All right. Let's eat.

237
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,010
I hope you enjoy it.

238
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,140
Enjoy.

239
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,300
Wow, it's very well-seasoned.

240
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,230
What a relief.

241
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,800
Eating together like this takes me back.

242
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,610
When Mom passed, you ordered us jjajangmyeon since you didn't know how to cook.

243
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,790
Just one bowl.

244
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:24,830
You said you didn't like jjajangmyeon then, and I believed it.

245
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,550
I'm sorry, Dad.

246
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,250
I...

247
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,070
really don't like jjajangmyeon.

248
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,570
I'm...

249
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,980
team tangsuyuk.

250
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,380
Dad, you're such a goofball.

251
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,940
No, I'm not a goofball.

252
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm a comedian.

253
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,150
 Was I funny? 

254
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,840
 You're not funny, Dad. 

255
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,230
   

256
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,020
When are you leaving, then?

257
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,180
Soon.

258
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,670
What will you do with Young Master?

259
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,370
Are you breaking up with him?

260
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,970
♫  I feel like you're looking at me  ♫

261
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:06,300
♫  I feel like you're smiling at me  ♫

262
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,080
 I think I'd feel comfortable if you stayed here. 

263
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:23,280
 Yoon Bok, thank you so much for always treating me with care. 

264
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:31,290
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

265
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,820
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

266
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,090
♫  Where are you?  ♫

267
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:44,330
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

268
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:52,550
♫  My love who disappeared like a mirage  ♫

269
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,810
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

270
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,180
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

271
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,680
♫  Where are you?  ♫

272
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:26,030
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

273
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:32,980
♫  My love who disappeared like a mirage  ♫

274
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:41,800
♫  I dream of being in your arms every day  ♫

275
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,720
I know what I am supposed to do,

276
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,070
but I do not know why my heart aches so much.

277
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,260
Father.

278
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,140
 Sensational! Sensational! 

279
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,130
The show is a hit in Paris and Milan.

280
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,540
I'm Camille.

281
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,890
It's to be expected. Why make a fuss?

282
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,810
Hong Do Kim,

283
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,390
- are you feeling okay? 
 - Yes.

284
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,520
I told you to take a break until you go to Paris. Why did you come in?

285
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,450
You went through so much because of me that day. I'm sorry.

286
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,660
Sorry, my foot. Don't say stuff like that.

287
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,830
Not between us.

288
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,020
Take good care of yourself before you leave.

289
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,530
You're about to become a world-class designer soon.

290
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,850
Taking care of your health is crucial.

291
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,320
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

292
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,900
Let's do well in Paris, too.

293
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,910
   

294
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,200
   

295
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,010
 I hope you achieve your dream and only walk on paths covered with petals. 

296
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,710
   

297
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,360
 Teacher, I'm on my way back to Seoul. 

298
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,920
 Can I see you for a moment? 

299
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,760
Right here. Please pull over here.

300
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,510
Okay.

301
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,980
Hi.

302
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,470
Have you been well?

303
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,550
Yes.

304
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,720
Have you been well, too, Teacher?

305
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,170
Yes.

306
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,110
Is your preparation to leave going well?

307
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,280
Yes, it's going fine.

308
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,250
How about you? Are things going well in the village?

309
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,350
There was a lot to do after the fashion show.

310
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,650
So, I have been busy.

311
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,400
I see.

312
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,500
That's great.

313
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,160
Why did you want to see me today?

314
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,110
I wanted to see you...

315
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,540
because I needed to tell you something.

316
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,060
Before I met you,

317
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,910
I did not realize what I wanted.

318
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,440
Since I met you, I finally realized...

319
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,500
what I wanted to do,

320
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,360
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

321
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:25,670
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

322
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,680
...what happiness means,

323
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,370
 100. 

324
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,590
 Yoon Bok! 

325
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:40,030
♫  I wonder if you're also under the same night sky  ♫

326
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:50,250
♫  I looked for you everywhere that night but you were nowhere in sight  ♫

327
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,110
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

328
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:00,000
♫  I met someone who resembles you  ♫

329
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,550
...and what it means to open up and live freely.

330
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,950
So from now on,

331
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,240
I will do as you want me to do.

332
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,880
I will stay in Seongsan Village

333
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,460
and protect the village and its people.

334
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,570
♫  Dreaming one last  ♫

335
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,810
I hope you...

336
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,890
achieve your dream there, too.

337
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,420
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

338
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,600
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

339
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,510
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

340
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:59,110
♫  I wonder if you're also under the same night sky  ♫

341
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,720
Okay.

342
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,020
I will.

343
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,170
I sincerely...

344
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,300
wish for your well-being...

345
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,570
and happiness.

346
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,400
♫  I met someone who resembles you  ♫

347
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,990
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫

348
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:33,530
♫  When I hold you in my arms  ♫

349
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,510
Thank you.

350
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,180
I...

351
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,360
wish for your well-being and happiness, too.

352
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,730
♫  Even in my dreams, dreaming one last  ♫

353
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,400
♫  Dreaming one last  ♫

354
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,620
♫  Beyond the time that froze  ♫

355
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,670
♫  You finally wound up in my arms  ♫

356
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:07,040
♫  Please stay a little longer  ♫

357
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,820
♫  I've been waiting for a long time  ♫

358
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,060
 There was something I really wanted to tell her. 

359
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,560
 But... 

360
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,350
 I do not think I can tell you that. 

361
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,310
 I love you. 

362
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,490
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

363
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,640
♫  I met someone who resembles you  ♫

364
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,100
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫

365
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:53,010
♫  When I hold you in my arms  ♫

366
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,230
Eat well when you get there.

367
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,780
- Don't just eat bread. 
 - Dad, bread is like rice there.

368
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,350
You think I don't know that?

369
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,190
But Koreans are fueled by rice.

370
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,720
Be quiet!

371
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,770
I can take care of myself.

372
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,720
Please leave.

373
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,990
I told you not to come, but you didn't listen.

374
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,090
I'll go. I'll be in touch. Go home.

375
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,110
Okay. Bye.

376
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,090
Dad, be well with Hong Hak.

377
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,350
Don't go off somewhere again!

378
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,790
I won't.

379
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,560
Take care of yourself.

380
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,810
Young Master,

381
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,230
everyone is waiting.

382
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,580
All right, I will be right there.

383
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,900
   

384
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,480
What are your thoughts?

385
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,880
Tell me if there is something you want to see happen

386
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,380
in the village from the list.

387
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,660
Come in.

388
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,440
Well, Yoon Bok.

389
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,060
May I join you, too?

390
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,710
Of course.

391
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,140
Please have a seat here.

392
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,200
   

393
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,990
   

394
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,870
   

395
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,280
   

396
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,550
You finally agreed to see me.

397
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,250
I'm here to tell you not to visit me anymore.

398
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,310
A police officer shouldn't keep coming here.

399
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,050
I quit being a police officer.

400
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,920
- What? 
 - Joon Ho,

401
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,460
I'm so sorry I lied to you then.

402
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,670
I'm also sorry I didn't know about your pain all this time.

403
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,910
Why bring that up now? It's all in the past.

404
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,960
That's why I'll have a fresh start.

405
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:26,180
I'll go back to the place where I had the best memories of my life.

406
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,460
By chance, are you—

407
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Yes.

408
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,350
I'll go back to Seongsan Village...

409
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:39,000
and live there remembering my time there...

410
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,240
with you.

411
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,310
Shin Yi Bok.

412
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:49,350
I'll always leave the spot next to me unoccupied.

413
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,070
So, come back...

414
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,570
anytime you want to.

415
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,700
 What? Excellency Lee? 

416
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,640
Yes. I am glad he finally came back.

417
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,240
Yes.

418
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,880
How did the village meeting go today?

419
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,070
We finally reached an agreement.

420
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,570
That is great.

421
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:26,530
Realize your vision one by one.

422
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,260
Yes.

423
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,520
Sister.

424
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,610
Grandfather,

425
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,870
I'm here.

426
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,530
Yi Bok, it is you.

427
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,250
I am glad you came.

428
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,470
I am very glad.

429
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,790
The moon is very beautiful.

430
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,500
 The moon must be beautiful there, too. 

431
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,960
 How many times should the moon set... 

432
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,360
 for me to forget you? 

433
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,850
   

434
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,900
   

435
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,500
Hi, Hong Do.

436
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,690
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

437
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,370
He's waiting for you.

438
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,110
Already?

439
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,740
Hello, Designer Kim Hong Do.

440
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,900
Oh, yes. You came early.

441
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,070
Have a seat.

442
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:28,610
I bought your debut piece from last year.

443
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,680
Yes, it looks good on you.

444
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,470
I hear that a lot.

445
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,470
By the way, why did you want to see me?

446
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,480
I heard you're starting Camille's second brand under your name.

447
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,770
The thing is, I'm going to Cannes because of my last project.

448
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:53,070
Would you allow me to showcase your work for the first time there?

449
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,790
I see.

450
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,980
  ­ 

451
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,450
   

452
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,040
   

453
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,120
He's doing well.

454
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,190
   

455
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,280
- This is— 
 - I learned how to make coffee from...

456
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,610
a lady from Seoul.

457
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,780
There will be foreigners at the village festival.

458
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,860
I'm thinking of offering it with shikhye and sujeonggwa. 
  (Traditional Korean dessert drinks) 

459
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,200
Let us do that.

460
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,100
How clever.

461
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,570
I'm very impressed with Seongsan Village's will to change and evolve.

462
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,600
Many organizations wish to donate since the public is responding positively.

463
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,590
How did you suddenly open up completely?

464
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:56,270
My grandchildren have been bothering me about it every day.

465
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,740
How can I say no to them?

466
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,750
Since we are on the topic,

467
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,820
we are thinking of opening up the village storage.

468
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,710
- Village storage? 
 - We'll display the treasures that have been

469
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,590
hidden in storage and share their beauty with everyone.

470
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,780
That's a wonderful idea.

471
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,670
Did you know Seongsan Village was on the news in France a few days ago?

472
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:25,630
It's about Camille launching a new brand by their Korean designer.

473
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,160
They also introduced the village in the article.

474
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,210
Did you say a Korean designer just now?

475
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,970
Yes.

476
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,170
Would you like to have a look?

477
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,030
   

478
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,870
   

479
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:18,940
   

480
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,360
 Congrats. 

481
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,960
 When is Season 2 coming out? 

482
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,770
Out of these countless heart emojis...

483
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:39,800
I don't see the one I really want to see.

484
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,560
You are the webtoon artist of the year.

485
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,780
Why are you having a pity party on your own?

486
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,640
Yoon Ah.

487
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,580
Congratulations on the win.

488
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,820
Thank you.

489
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,640
It's all thanks to my muse.

490
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,820
I read on the internet that there will be Season 2 of "Strong Woman, Oh Yoon Ah."

491
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,480
Since you brought it up...

492
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,820
I'm so thankful that you agreed to be my muse.

493
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,560
Do not mention it.

494
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,530
In Season 2, I don't want you to be my muse.

495
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,680
I want to hire you as my writer.

496
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,960
Are you interested in switching jobs?

497
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,080
I can pay you salary now.

498
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,910
Cheers.

499
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,110
Do not forget how you started.

500
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,320
I'm in your care, Yoon Ah.

501
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,560
Wow, you're a strong man now.

502
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,780
Right?

503
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,500
You seem a bit better than last time.

504
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,490
I think you look great.

505
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,620
The outfit suits you well, too.

506
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,040
Really?

507
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,120
Does it?

508
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,380
I saw the news about the village opening up. Is that true?

509
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,860
You have no idea.

510
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,150
The village is busy because of that.

511
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,180
People from the outside come by often

512
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,110
to teach us various things.

513
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,510
I started learning something recently, too.

514
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,470
You did?

515
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,650
Have you heard of Zumba?

516
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,110
Like this. Like this.

517
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,430
You shake your body like this.

518
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,750
It is so fun, and it makes you lose weight, too.

519
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,490
Although I have not lost weight yet.

520
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,680
The time is up.

521
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,060
Why does time go by so fast?

522
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,320
Joon Ho, I will be back again.

523
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,200
Make sure to eat well.

524
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,810
See you next time.

525
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,160
Excuse me.

526
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,860
Please take good care of my mom.

527
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,430
Yeojudaek.

528
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,380
Let's stop by somewhere briefly.

529
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,560
What for?

530
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,090
I want to spend money.

531
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,350
Money?

532
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,810
I fixed the roof of the house with the persimmon tree yesterday.

533
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,070
And I made a cart for the soup restaurant the day before.

534
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,740
I've been making good money recently.

535
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:15,460
I can buy you as much cheese katsu as you want.

536
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,200
All right...

537
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,500
Try it.

538
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,950
Relationships can be as long-lasting and strong as cheese.

539
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,680
Of course,

540
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,190
you can cut it off like this, but...

541
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,700
Eat, eat.

542
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:07,030
But if you taste it, it's nutty and chewy.

543
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:14,140
I'd like our relationship to continue like that, too.

544
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,260
What do you think?

545
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,260
My gosh...

546
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,430
Why say something so embarrassing?

547
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,320
Just eat the tonkatsu.

548
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,410
This is what they call mozzarella.

549
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,510
You can't eat it at night.

550
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,120
Why not?

551
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,680
It lets you mozza. 
  (Sounds like "can't sleep") 

552
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,860
What do you do when you can't sleep?

553
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,670
You have me. Say, ah.

554
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,550
It's okay to eat during the day.

555
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,920
The next piece is the masterpiece of the late Joseon era you all know of.

556
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,220
It's Cheolhwa Baekja.

557
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,320
Yes, we'll start at...

558
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,150
200,000 won.

559
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,510
200,000 won, anyone?

560
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,740
200,000 won. 210,000 won.

561
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,260
220,000 won. 230,000 won, anyone?

562
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,070
Okay, I'll give you three seconds.

563
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:05,960
Three, two, one. Sold!

564
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,440
 - What? 
 - What's this? 

565
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,120
 Geez. 

566
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,760
 What's going on? 

567
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,600
What? Why won't it open?

568
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,020
It's not opening?

569
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,100
Geez, this feels familiar.

570
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,370
I heard there are people who buy and sell

571
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:46,010
counterfeit cultural heritage these days. So I stopped by.

572
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,690
Do you...

573
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,990
buy or sell?

574
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,080
Or do you create counterfeits?

575
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,730
Seongsan Village...

576
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,170
Long time no see.

577
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,230
Gosh, I know.

578
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,010
It's good to see you again.

579
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,210
Oh, this?

580
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,450
We didn't steal it. It's fake. Fake.

581
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,490
People are so skillful these days.

582
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,020
It's a Grade-A fake.

583
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,780
Could you forgive me just once?

584
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:33,130
Counterfeits like this decrease the value of cultural heritage

585
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:37,850
and confuse the public. How could you not know that?

586
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:42,940
I will warn you this time, but next time,

587
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,200
you will have to pay for the crime.

588
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,710
Thank you!

589
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,800
Attention, everyone. Salut!

590
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,960
Salut!

591
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,180
Let's leave. Let's leave. Take this.

592
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,480
Thank you.

593
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,700
What? I was in the restroom.

594
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,800
Is it already over?

595
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,740
Let us grab a meal nearby.

596
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:26,190
Seeing you two protecting our inheritance from the ancestors

597
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:29,160
make me feel very happy.

598
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,760
I think it is time for me to bequeath the village to you.

599
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,280
Before that,

600
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,730
let me ask you one thing.

601
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,190
What is the most precious treasure to you?

602
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,460
- It's people. 
 - It's people.

603
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,880
There are many expensive, rare,

604
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,290
and endlessly valuable treasures in this world,

605
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,350
but nothing is more precious...

606
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,300
than people.

607
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,270
Yes, you are right.

608
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,700
Whether they are impressive, ordinary,

609
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,830
or seemingly humble,

610
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:17,720
everyone is a treasure you cannot look down on.

611
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,230
Remember that always.

612
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,560
I will.

613
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,290
I will.

614
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:45,330
 Teacher, the night view is beautiful tonight as well. 

615
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,020
 How are you? 

616
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,710
Hong Do.

617
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,790
I heard you're finally launching Camille's second brand.

618
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:26,830
Congratulations.

619
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,220
Thank you.

620
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,410
When is the show?

621
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,350
Soon.

622
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,690
Wow! I'll be there. I'm so excited.

623
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,040
   

624
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,730
   

625
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,400
   

626
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,800
It looks like Yoon Bok has finally become the village leader.

627
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,200
What?

628
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,980
   

629
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,990
Yi Bok is the village leader?

630
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,040
What about Yoon Bok, then?
