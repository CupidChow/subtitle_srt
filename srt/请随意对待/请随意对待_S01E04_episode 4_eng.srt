00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
   

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:09,320
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,760
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,520
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,180
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,920
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,530
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,460
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,050
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,000
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:55,530


12
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,950
How did I come all the way home?

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,510
 Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok! 

14
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,920
 Teacher, where are we? 

15
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,140
 Your face looks orange. 

16
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,510
 My face? 

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,580
 Yoon Bok, I'll get you something to drink. 

18
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,060
 Wait here for a moment. 

19
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,580
 Are you... 

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,310
 abandoning me? 

21
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,790
How could I be so rude?

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,040
I should not have behaved so incredibly rude to Teacher.

23
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,530
 Yoon Bok! 

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,070
I need to hurry up and ask her for forgiveness.

25
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,310
   

26
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,830
Why do your lips look like spoonworms?

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Should I suggest we get some spoonworms?

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,490
No, he must've had it before.

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,560
Sis, are you getting spoonworms?

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,380
I like them, too.

31
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,390
I'll be late today.

32
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,310
You're getting spoonworms without me?

33
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,730
How could you go that far?

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,950
Yoon Bok.

35
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,900
Teacher, did you sleep well?

36
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,780
Yes, did you sleep well?

37
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,200
Yes.

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,150
I was so rude to you last night.

39
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,490
Not at all. You're leaving, right?

40
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,700
Should we go now?

41
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,360
Pardon?

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,700
Huh?

43
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,900
 Yoon Bok, the weekend starts tomorrow. What's your plan? 

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,790
 I do not have any specific plans. 

45
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,160
 Really? Want to go on a city tour with me for a change, then? 

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,040
 - A city tour? 
 - Yes. 

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,570
 An event for my student, Shin Yoon Bok, who's feeling down. 

48
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,220
 It's Kim Hong Do's treat! 

49
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,530
 Okay, sounds good. 

50
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,560
 - You mean it, right? We're going. Okay? 
 - Okay. 

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,770
Huh? My gosh, are you okay?

52
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,280
You have a hangover from last night's drinking, huh?

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,720
You must be tired.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,070
We don't have to go if you're tired.

55
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,700
Next time. We can go next time.

56
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,240
No, it is because I overslept.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,980
I will get ready quickly. Could you wait a moment?

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,700
Are you sure you're okay, Yoon Bok?

59
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,530
Yes, I will get ready quickly.

60
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,420
Okay, take your time.

61
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,920
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

62
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,090
♫  I want to hug you but I guess I'm scared  ♫

63
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,470
♫  I hide it and try to push it away, but it's already here  ♫

64
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,610
♫  You smiled at me brighter than sunshine  ♫

65
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,490
♫  I want you, I need you  ♫

66
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,560
♫  Come back to my side anytime  ♫

67
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,480
♫  For me, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,110
♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

69
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,150
♫  Yes, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

70
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,760
♫  It must be love  ♫

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,810
Yoon Bok, this is so fun.

72
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,540
Yoon Bok.

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,170
Yoon Bok!

74
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,730
♫  Waited for me like a tall tree  ♫

75
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,290
My gosh.

76
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,600
♫  I can only rest in you  ♫

77
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
Thank you.

78
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,960
Yoon Bok, you're so good.

79
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,510
You were like a professional archer.

80
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,190
I want to dedicate this to you.

81
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,560
Really?

82
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,360
Thank you, Yoon Bok.

83
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,970
Look at this.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
♫  I've been hiding my heart for a long time  ♫

85
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,970
Here.

86
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,690
Thank you.

87
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:47,360
♫  I'll love you more since it was delayed  ♫

88
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
   

89
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,420
♫  You shine  ♫

90
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,910
The dish looks like a volcano.

91
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,070
It looks like it is about to erupt.

92
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,530
W-When can you eat this?

93
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,310
Wait a moment.

94
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,060
Eat beef, minari,

95
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,390
and mung bean sprouts like this. Here.

96
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,710
Thank you.

97
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,090
Yoon Bok, are you okay?

98
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,310
It's spicy, isn't it?

99
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,700
It is tasty.

100
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,710
Your face is so red.

101
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,120
You can't handle spicy. My gosh.

102
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,170
Since the dish called mulgalbi filled me up,

103
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,020
I did not think I could eat anymore.

104
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,870
But why is this so easy to eat?

105
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,130
Don't you know "Sweet-salty-sweet-salty"?

106
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,290
You crave something sweet after eating something salty.

107
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,540
Sweet-salty-sweet-salty.

108
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,910
Life is like that, too.

109
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,980
Once the salty days that made you cry pass,

110
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,300
you get to have a sweet day like this, too.

111
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:31,110
How come you know so many fun and interesting things?

112
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,030
I don't know that much.

113
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,410
For me, everything I did with you today was my first time.

114
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:45,480
My heart had always been heavy due to old objects and events,

115
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,200
but I feel better after experiencing new things.

116
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,190
I'm the happiest when I spend time with you.

117
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,290
Me, too.

118
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,950
I haven't had so much fun in a while, thanks to you.

119
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,290
- Let's go. 
 - Pardon?

120
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,550
We have one more place to visit.

121
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,090
Follow me.

122
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,520
Teacher.

123
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,870
Look over there.

124
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,120
The sunset here is amazing.

125
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,650
Teacher, thank you so much for today.

126
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,450
I should be thanking you.

127
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,570
Let me know anytime you want to get fresh air.

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,470
You don't know my number.

129
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,770
 Let's stay in touch from now on. 

130
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,580
 No. 

131
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,970
 How could I exchange phone numbers and treat you like a friend? 

132
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,600
Give me.

133
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,920
You don't have to give me yours. I'll just give you mine.

134
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,590
Here.

135
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,400
Call me.

136
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,290
Thank you.

137
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,570
I'm leaving.

138
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,110
Bye.

139
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,770
   

140
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,200
Hello?

141
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,910
 Teacher. 

142
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,570
You can also call me whenever you feel tired...

143
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,180
and want to get fresh air.

144
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,610
What's this?

145
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,580
♫  When the stars show up in the dark sky  ♫

146
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,630
♫  It was so very beautiful  ♫

147
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,460
♫  I've been picturing  ♫

148
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,620
 Come on in, Yoon Bok. 

149
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,610
 I cannot be with you in such a small space. 

150
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,720
♫  Like it was meant to be  ♫

151
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,460
 I will come in now. 

152
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,130
 Look at the lens over here. 

153
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,670
 You see the time here. Right? 

154
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,470
 Yoon Bok, come a little closer. 

155
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,570
 Okay. 

156
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,390
 Hurry. It's starting. Hurry! 

157
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,530
♫  I've been hoping for a long time  ♫

158
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,450
 I'm the happiest when I spend time with you. 

159
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,980
Spending time with me?

160
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,520
With me?

161
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,260
My gosh!

162
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,350
Look at the dark circles.

163
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,850
Did I overdo it yesterday?

164
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,740
As long as Yoon Bok had fun.

165
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,050
   

166
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,290
The director of the Cultural Heritage Admin suggested Panmunjeom

167
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,780
instead of Seongsan Village.

168
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,490
Is he slow or bad at hearing?

169
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,430
I told him so many times. He still doesn't get it?

170
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,950
Shouldn't we prepare for Plan B?

171
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,070
No, I never give up.

172
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,990
I'll proceed with Plan A, no matter what.

173
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,540
Hello.

174
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,660
Hong Do Kim, you're in love.

175
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,380
- Pardon? 
 - With work.

176
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,320
I wonder what fashion trend the "yeolsoepae" will start.

177
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm dying to know.

178
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,630
I support your love passionately.

179
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,280
Thank you.

180
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,680
Go, go, go, go...

181
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,800
Go, go, go, go...

182
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,770
A death from 17 years ago?

183
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,690
The object my father had during the fire was found recently.

184
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,110
I am afraid the person who took it hurt my father.

185
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,910
I wonder if he was a victim of a crime, not just fire.

186
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,080
The record says there was no sign of foul play.

187
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,800
A few contusions were found, but...

188
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,490
By chance, was it done by someone...

189
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,960
It wasn't a fatal injury.

190
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,440
Since the body was damaged seriously by fire,

191
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,500
all I can tell you is that there was no sign of foul play.

192
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,220
 Father! 

193
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,990
 The man had a burn mark on his arm. 

194
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,200
Young Master, should I take you home?

195
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,530
No.

196
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,050
I posted on internet travel sites and clubs just in case.

197
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,940
We will be contacted soon.

198
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,000
I was definitely at the scene that day.

199
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,490
How could I not remember anything?

200
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,870
How could I remember what happened 17 years ago?

201
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,060
Did you not notice anything unusual?

202
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,870
What do you mean, unusual...

203
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,730
You said you saw the investigation file.

204
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,390
There was no sign of arson.

205
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,370
What you saw there is everything.

206
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm sorry.

207
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,170
   

208
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,110
Yes, Detective.

209
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,920
 Young Master, I found it. 

210
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,720
 One of my informants is an antique seller. 

211
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,730
 Someone is trying to sell an incense burner Gamjjok stole. 

212
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,550
 I looked into it just in case and... 

213
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,150
 the composite drawing resembles one of the bastards who fled the club. 

214
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,510
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

215
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,320
No need to look.

216
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,900
It's definitely authentic, I said.

217
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,700
Geez, you're so freaking slow.

218
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,330
Forget it if you won't buy it!

219
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,670
Seriously, why are you so impatient?

220
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,560
I told you it's authentic.

221
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,410
Hello.

222
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,580
You bastard, you...

223
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,190
Don't come here.

224
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,260
I'll stab him if you take a step closer.

225
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,450
Drop the knife and come. You'll get caught, anyway.

226
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,000
What are you saying?

227
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,640
Hey, you'll regret going that way, man!

228
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,760
Shit.

229
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,110
I've seen that fan somewhere.

230
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,450
You are the one who uses your fist, but don't steal.

231
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,380
- W-Well... 
 - Geez.

232
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,520
Look at his nose bleeding.

233
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,450
I said you'd regret it, didn't I?

234
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,010
I-I'm sorry.

235
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,770
   

236
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,510
 Does it hurt a lot? 

237
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,700
Of course. I was just standing guard.

238
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,100
 Who's your higher-up who told you to stand guard? 

239
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,390
I wouldn't be alive if I knew who he was.

240
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,010
He kills everyone who finds out who he is?

241
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,830
Yes.

242
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,240
You stole from someone that scary?

243
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,470
It's because of the cops...

244
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,720
The deal was broken because of the police.

245
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,990
 Oh, the deal? 

246
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,880
 What deal? 

247
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,470
You little. Stop looking around and tell me.

248
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,400
The thing is...

249
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,600
They said they'd get a new spot to exchange goods.

250
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,920
A spot to exchange goods? Where's that?

251
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,800
A spot to exchange goods?

252
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,440
 Could Seongsan Hall be related to the case? 

253
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,830
That man is from Seongsan Village.

254
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,490
   

255
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,040
   

256
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,290
Detective Park, please plant someone here secretly.

257
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,810
You want to go undercover, you mean?

258
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,210
   

259
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,020
I'll look into it.

260
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,370
   

261
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,000
Canceled?

262
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,100
All of a sudden?

263
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,330
 The view count is low and there are too many vicious comments. 

264
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,930
 I think we'll have to cancel it. 

265
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,120
Bodyguard?

266
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,710
What are you doing right now?

267
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,720
- Bodyguard! 
 - By chance...

268
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,620
did you just take my phone number?

269
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,930
There was something I had to ask you.

270
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,110
I said I have nothing to tell you.

271
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,790
Leave.

272
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,280
Come on, Bodyguard.

273
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,230
I'll be in touch!

274
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,150
Open the gate!

275
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,870
- You know Seongsan Village, right? 
 - Yes.

276
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,150
There's a man named Shin Soo Geun there.

277
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,760
Deliver this to him.

278
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,470
Okay.

279
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,600
Oh, by the way, Seongsan Village is—

280
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,470
Not open to anyone.

281
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,950
I'm telling you to get in there somehow.

282
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,900
I hate when things are impossible, you know.

283
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,260
You have to deliver it to him in person. Okay?

284
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,840
Well...

285
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,190
I got it.

286
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,040
   

287
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,910
   

288
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,470
What do I do?

289
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,650
Should I ask Yoon Bok?

290
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,260
I have Yoon Bok's number.

291
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,080
 The phone is turned off. 

292
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,960
 - After the beep...  
 - It's off.

293
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,820
He must be busy.

294
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,580
Gosh, what do I do?

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,530
Goodness, I forgot to say goodbye to Teacher.

296
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,020
   

297
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,360
   

298
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,230
 I'd been to Seongsan Village 17 years ago. 

299
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,510
 What do you need to know? 

300
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,800
   

301
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,410
   

302
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,300
   

303
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,040
   

304
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,070
 Joon Ho. 

305
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,690
 Someone wants to sponsor you directly. 

306
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:56,620
 They want to provide you with tuition and a job if you're okay with it. 

307
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,260
   

308
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,760
 [Seongsan Hall[ 

309
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,500
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

310
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,060
 Yoon Bok, I'm on my way to Seongsan Village right now. 

311
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,050
 I wanted to ask you how to enter the village. 

312
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,490
 Could you call me when you see this? 

313
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,510
Yes.

314
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,390
Thank you for all of your hard work.

315
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,050
- Of course, sir. 
 - Yes.

316
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,620
What is he doing in his room, anyway?

317
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,200
Are you crazy?

318
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,040
I begged you several times

319
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,810
not to come outside since there will be a lot of people around today.

320
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,830
I even gave you food and a chamber pot.

321
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,890
You cannot be out like this.

322
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,630
What if someone sees you?

323
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,250
I came in because no one else was outside.

324
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,920
G-Go inside right now.

325
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,930
Yeojudaek,

326
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,690
you were watching me last night, weren't you?

327
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,220
D-Did I?

328
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,230
You watched everything.

329
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,170
I-I am not sure what you mean...

330
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,020
 Mom. 

331
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,880
- Mom. 
 - Oh, son.

332
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,760
What brings you here?

333
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,990
Is someone in there? I heard someone talking.

334
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,630
No, what do you mean?

335
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,250
My baby. You must be hearing things since you have been ill.

336
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,270
- I definitely heard something. 
 - Oh, no...

337
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,950
Yeojudaek.

338
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,890
Hyungnim.

339
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,940
Yeojudaek, were you watching YouTube again?

340
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,490
Grandfather might scold you if he hears you.

341
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,990
I even gave you wireless headphones to be careful.

342
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,190
Yes, my goodness...

343
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,510
I keep forgetting since I am not used to using them.

344
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,110
I did not know you give presents to the lowly ones.

345
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,190
How dare you talk to him like that?

346
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,190
My apologies, Young Master.

347
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,920
If so, have a pleasant time, Hyungnim.

348
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,160
How long will you live a lowly life like this?

349
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,380
I told you to live comfortably with me outside.

350
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,930
You might think I look lowly,

351
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,250
but to me, it is an important work to protect tradition.

352
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,110
You should behave properly outside, too.

353
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,320
Do not taint the name of the village.

354
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,050
What did the village ever do for me?

355
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,120
Someone else let me live like a human.

356
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,630
You said you haven't met them yet.

357
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,660
You might get into trouble by getting help from a stranger.

358
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,730
I wouldn't have been a business owner if it wasn't for him.

359
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,140
They'd still be saying, "You bastard, that bastard," to me.

360
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,920
Don't you agree?

361
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,920
So, you should be referred to as "madam...

362
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,860
missus" outside, too—

363
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,000
Come on. Stop talking nonsense.

364
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,120
Just carry these and follow me.

365
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,180
I am so busy. So busy.

366
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,670
Mom.

367
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,940
Hurry up!

368
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,360
- Here you go. 
 - Is that it?

369
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,070
Yes.

370
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,080
Take your time looking through it.

371
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,070
Thank you.

372
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,330
 I remember. 

373
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,960
   

374
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,620
Hello. One ticket, please.

375
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,080
Thank you.

376
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,670
So pretty.

377
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,890
One more time. One more time.

378
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,090
   

379
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,500
There it is.

380
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,590
Gosh, the weather is so nice.

381
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,860
Stop right there.

382
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,680
Hello.

383
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,890
My name is Kim Hong Do.

384
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,650
I'd like to deliver something to Mr. Shin Soo Geun from Seoul.

385
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,680
"Mister"?

386
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,370
It's this thing. I have to deliver this to him directly.

387
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,790
Could you let me go in for a moment?

388
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,620
No.

389
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,880
I'll just step in, deliver this, and come out. Please?

390
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,670
I said no. Did I not?

391
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,240
Oh, or you can have him come out here.

392
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,170
Come on. Step back.

393
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,360
Mister, please. Just once, please?

394
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,730
Step back.

395
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,690
If you do not leave now, I will kick you out of the town square.

396
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,320
What do I do?

397
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,970
   

398
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,660
Which family are you from?

399
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,500
I am the eldest daughter of His Excellency Kim.

400
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,490
Please open the gate.

401
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,690
His Excellency Kim?

402
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,310
Oh, His Excellency Kim?

403
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,170
I know his eldest daughter well.

404
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,610
Show me your face.

405
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,390
How dare you?

406
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,040
How dare you try to see a young lady's face.

407
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,410
Stop harassing me.

408
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,810
If you do not open the gate, you will be in trouble!

409
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,360
Goodness, you have watched too many period dramas.

410
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,970
No ladies cover their faces in this day and age.

411
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,380
Unless you are a criminal.

412
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,160
My gosh.

413
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,700
What a shady person you are.

414
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,080
Hear ye! Get this sinner out of the town square immediately!

415
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,910
Mister! Mister, I'm sorry.

416
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,750
Hold on!

417
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,130
Hold on! Please, Mister?

418
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,950
Stop!

419
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,610
- Yoon Bok! 
 - Get your hands off her immediately.

420
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,220
My gosh.

421
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,700
Teacher, are you okay?

422
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,340
Yes, I'm okay.

423
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,780
By the way, what brings you all the way here?

424
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,620
The thing is, it's for work.

425
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,330
I need to deliver something to Mr. Shin Soo Geun in person.

426
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,880
Shin Soo Geun, you said?

427
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,520
Yes.

428
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,920
Open it.

429
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,930
Young Master, I cannot let an unidentified outsider in.

430
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,540
I know her very well.

431
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,670
I will be fully responsible, so open it.

432
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,240
I will take her to him myself.

433
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,460
Let us go in.

434
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,030
Thank you, Yoon Bok.

435
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,810
Thank you. Thank you.

436
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,980
Thank you.

437
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,960
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

438
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,360
It is difficult to get phone reception here.

439
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,100
I did not realize you contacted me.

440
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,340
- My apologies. 
 - No, I should be thanking you.

441
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,180
I still came in, thanks to you.

442
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,620
By the way, it really feels like time froze here.

443
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,410
- Let us go. 
 - Okay.

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,700
What's that?

448
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,080
So pretty.

455

It is where the villagers and I rest.

456
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,000
Three hundred years old? Wow.

457
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,780

 "Confucius said... 

462
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,310
 A nobleman is not a vessel. 

463
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,740
 A nobleman is not a vessel. 

464
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,420
 Finding one's own path." 

465
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,720
This school was built 200 years ago.

466
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,130
It is also my alma mater.

467
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,680
School?

468
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,670
This is so fascinating.

469
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,540
This way.

470
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,840
It's amazing! This is amazing!

471
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,140
Why are you flopping like fish on land?

472
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,550
Young Master Yoon Bok...

473
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,670
He brought a woman with him!

474
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,780
- What? 
 - Is she pretty?

475
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,250
Welcome, Lady Se Ryeong.

476
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,680
I asked if that woman was good-looking.

477
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,580
Not exactly good-looking... how shall I put it...

478
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,090
Plain?

479
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,750
Yes.

480
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:35,090
But the vibe between them was like fog on top of Mt. Seong.

481
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,690
What were the two doing?

482
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,320
They were walking together to Woorim House.

483
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,100
Are they not having a memorial service today?

484
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,640
All the elders are gathering today.

485
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,350
It cannot be.

486
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,340
Is he introducing her to them?

487
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,100
Gosh, they would be throwing a party soon.

488
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,500
What do you mean, a party?

489
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,940
Young Master Yoon Bok has had a fiancée since he was young.

490
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,870
Well, the elders were just joking—

491
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,710
A promise made jokingly is still a promise.

492
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,480
Of course.

493
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,960
What's this? Is today a special day?

494
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,190
There is a memorial service today.

495
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,890
You take memorial services seriously here.

496
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,490
Come this way.

497
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:36,330
It will be difficult to meet my grandfather in that attire.

498
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,810
Grandfather?

499
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,630
By chance...

500
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,300
Is Shin Soo... no, no.

501
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,700
Is Mr. Shin your grandfather?

502
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,540
My gosh.

503
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,110
I will call for help. Please wait here for a moment.

504
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,650
Okay.

505
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,380
Are you Young Master's guest?

506
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,440
Young... Oh, yes, yes.

507
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,520
Come this way.

508
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,970
Okay.

509
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,500
Teacher, I am here to pick you up.

510
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,250
Let us go.

511
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,610
Wait for me, Yoon Bok!

512
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,590
You brought this lady yourself, Yoon Bok?

513
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:28,910
Yes, I brought her because she has to deliver something to you in person.

514
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:43,550
My boss, Ms. Camille, said I must deliver this to you directly.

515
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,600
That's why I came, risking being rude.

516
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,570
Who did you mention just now?

517
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,480
Ms. Camille.

518
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,590
Will that old man open the gate for us?

519
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,060
I heard he's stubborn.

520
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,140
As long as Hong Do Kim can deliver the item,

521
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,370
he won't have a choice.

522
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,620
Why are you so confident? Huh?

523
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,490
Since there is a family event,

524
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,790
stay here overnight, and I will let you know when we are done.

525
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,950
Yoon Bok, you should go get ready, too.

526
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,460
Okay.

527
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,770
   

528
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:10,460
 I think I found the most beautiful view in Paris. 

529
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:19,580
 I cannot see Paris since its beauty was overwhelmed by yours. 

530
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,720
When he broke up with me and left,

531
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,720
he gave me the key and said this.

532
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,260
 I will keep my memory with you here 

533
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,960
 and forget about it as if it never happened. 

534
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,740
 So... 

535
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,080
 please forget me and live well. 

536
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,420
 I don't want to. 

537
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,520
 Does your family matter more than me? 

538
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,550
 I am sorry. 

539
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:17,220
 Maybe once in our lives, 

540
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,260
 when you wish to see me, 

541
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,980
 I will open up my heart and come to you. 

542
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,350
She ended up...

543
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,650
sending this to me.

544
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,620
Stay here, and I will let you know as soon as he decides.

545
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,030
Okay. Don't worry about me, and get to work.

546
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,420
One, two, three, four, five...

547
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,440
2007 was...

548
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,370
It stopped when he was seven.

549
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,250
   

550
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,720
Yi Bok?

551
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,390
Let me help, too.

552
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,160
Gosh, would you like to?

553
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,310
Yes. What should I start with?

554
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,840
I have never seen you before. Which family are you from?

555
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,270
Well, I'm from Seoul.

556
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:23,940
How do you know Yoon Bok, exactly?

557
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,820
She is Young Master's teacher.

558
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,320
Teacher?

559
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,670
That is what he said earlier. It is true, right?

560
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:41,230
Well, yes.

561
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,500
I am not a school teacher.

562
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,170
I was at an academy.

563
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,380
By the way, who is the memorial service for?

564
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,350
Gosh, looks like Yoon Bok did not tell you.

565
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:00,460
This is His Excellency, Young Master's father's memorial service.

566
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,320
That is why Lady Se Ryeong comes by to help every year.

567
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,780
He loved me so much when he was alive.

568
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,560
This is the least I can do.

569
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,150
   

570
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,810
I don't get any service.

571
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,480
Camille must be curious.

572
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,560
It is a man named Kim Chil Bok who was tied up in the club.

573
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,350
I am not sure if it is his real name,

574
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:06,240
but I will send you a photo. Please check if he has criminal records.

575
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,210
Yes, thank you.

576
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,840
Bye.

577
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,800
   

578
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,200
   

579
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,960
 This is why I want to learn your name. 

580
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,720
 The series will be ending today. 

581
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,530
 I hope to come back with a better series. 

582
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,850
 See you again someday. 

583
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,350
"Oh Yoon Ah?"

584
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,230
Yoon Ah?

585
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,900
Yoon Ah?

586
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,180
Yoon Ah!

587
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,240
 The strong woman, Oh Yoon Ah. 

588
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,840
 Starting today, you're the protagonist of my story. 

589
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,420
 From the weak man. 

590
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,890
Get home safely.

591
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,440
Sir, we will also get going now.

592
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,460
Thank you for today.

593
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:48,350
Se Ryeong, thank you for coming by to lend a hand every year.

594
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:53,460
It is my duty as a woman to assist my neighbors with important events.

595
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,090
How admirable of you.

596
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,710
You are too generous.

597
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:01,040
An important event, my foot.

598
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,530
She has been wanting to marry Yoon Bok since she took her first step.

599
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,550
That is why she is doing this.

600
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,280
Father.

601
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,810
Is that true?

602
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,080
I can see so many stars from here.

603
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,900
Wow, how fascinating.

604
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,040
Look at those stars.

605
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,180
Deliver this to that woman for me.

606
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,680
Okay.

607
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,600
    
 A long time ago,

608
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,520
I indebted my heart to her.

609
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:18,280
She wishes to have a fashion show in Seongsan Village.

610
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,710
What are you planning to do?

611
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,320
I cannot put the village in danger again.

612
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,220
Also,

613
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,750
Se Ryeong stopped by earlier.

614
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,600
Should you not consider getting married soon?

615
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,530
She turned out proper and gentle.

616
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,260
She knows how to care for major family events

617
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,100
and most of all, she likes you a lot.

618
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,050
Who would be a better match for you?

619
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,530
Grandfather, I will manage my marriage myself—

620
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,210
By chance,

621
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,810
is there a woman you have feelings for?

622
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:12,700
I will tell you when the time comes.

623
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,300
Please do not worry about my marriage so much.

624
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,620
Have a good night, then.

625
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,770
 I will tell you when the time comes. 

626
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:54,450
 Please do not worry about my marriage so much. 

627
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:59,610
 Does he really have feelings for someone? 

628
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,820
♫  When the stars show up in the dark sky  ♫

629
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,870
♫  It was so very beautiful  ♫

630
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:17,900
♫  I've been picturing it in the sky  ♫

631
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,860
♫  Like this, I meet you again, like it was meant to be  ♫

632
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,190
♫  Oh, I...  ♫

633
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,670
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

634
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:36,950
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

635
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,010
♫  I've been hoping for a long time  ♫

636
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:49,190
♫  I waited for you endlessly for many days  ♫

637
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:56,920
♫  As long as I can stay with you  ♫

638
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,240
♫  I need you  ♫

639
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,360
♫  You are all I see when I open my eyes  ♫

640
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,000
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

641
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,720
 What? Why is my heart racing out of the blue? 

642
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:23,120
♫  I waited for you endlessly for many days  ♫

643
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,070
♫  As long as...  ♫

644
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:34,290
   

645
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:38,630
   

646
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,310
Do you have something to say to me?

647
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,550
What?

648
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,700
Well, no.

649
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,600
Yoon Bok, by chance,

650
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,460
does your heart...

651
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,650
Well, I mean...

652
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,650
B-By chance, do you have...

653
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,140
a favorite dish?

654
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,240
Well, it's namul. 
  (Marinated vegetables) 

655
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,480
Oh, right.

656
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,230
Yes, namul.

657
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,000
If so, is there someone...

658
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,970
Yoon Bok.

659
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:11,750


660
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:24,580
   

661
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:29,230
Kim Chil Bok. That man came to the village 17 years ago?

662
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,820
Okay.

663
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:36,100
Contact Detective Park and ask him if there are records of him.

664
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,620
   

665
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,580
Teacher is coming to Seongsan Village?

666
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,360
 How dare you? 

667
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,950
 How dare you try to see a young lady's face. 

668
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,460
 Stop harassing me. 

669
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,360
 If you do not open the gate, you will be in trouble! 

670
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,530
Teacher?

671
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:03,010
 Hear ye! Get this sinner out of the town square immediately! 

672
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,900
 - Mister! Mister...  
 - Stop!

673
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,590
 I'm sorry. Hold on! 

674
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,580
   

675
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,510
 Do you know anything about Yoon Bok's ex? 

676
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,760
 Hold on. That was why! 

677
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,600
 Yoon Bok! I missed you, Yoon Bok. 

678
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,890
 By the way, who are you? 

679
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,940
 Do I have to answer that question? 

680
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,310
 - Pardon? 
 - I don't want to. 

681
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,230
 Let me in! How come you are always so stubborn? 

682
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,450
 Stubborn? 

683
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:33,960
 - Director Lee, get her out of the village now. 
 - What? 

684
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,530
 There's no way a nobleman like Yoon Bok would do that. 

685
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,890
 Our fate was cut off a long time ago. 

686
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:43,490
 Shall we rekindle that fate today? 

687
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,430
 I looked up all the Kim Chil Boks in the country, but no one looked like the drawing. 

688
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,570
 He either has a fake name, got plastic surgery, 

689
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,520
 or he's a ghost. It's one of those three. 

690
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,200
 I will have to kill you today. 

691
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,320
 Stop! 

692
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,710
♫  Every day is about you  ♫
