1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,850
   

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:09,270
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,740
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,540
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,210
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,900
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,500
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,140
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,050
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,090
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:51,840


12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,050
My apologies.

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,890
I did not want you to get hurt, so I unintentionally

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,550
laid my hand on your body.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,540
It was you.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,980
It wasn't even your first time.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,720
Pardon?

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,930
Huh?

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,580
I mean, thank you for holding me.

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,300
It's so nice to see you, but I'm a bit tired.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,680
Shall we meet some other time?

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,700
It is late at night. Let me walk you home—

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,930
No, it's okay.

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,130
Take care, then. Bye.

25
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,620
Okay, if so...

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,880
I will get going now.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,660
Get home safely, Teacher.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,870
W-What are you doing?

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,280
Showing one's back to his teacher is impolite.

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,040
You crazy bitch.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,440
Are you insane?

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,660
Why did it have to be you?

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,350
I wanted to be remembered as a cool teacher.

34
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,800
Oh, well, I just won't see him again.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,040
Bye, Yoon Bok.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,360
I know it's sad, but let's never, ever meet again.

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,820
My gosh. Geez!

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,300
Geez, so embarrassing.

39
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,600
   

40
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,130
Did you sleep soundly last night, Teacher?

41
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,150
Are you okay?

42
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,190
W-What are you doing there, Yoon Bok?

43
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,940
I did not get a chance to tell you last night,

44
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,260
but I am staying here temporarily due to a situation.

45
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,890
I see.

46
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,230
I apologize if I scared you.

47
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,470
No, Yoon Bok.

48
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,760
It could happen.

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,180
Have a nice day, then.

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,770
What the hell?

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,530
What's this?

52
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,300
My goodness!

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,380
My gosh, what do I do? Gosh!

54
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,480
Gosh, so embarrassing!

55
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,740
Right, you know what?

56
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,060
Guess who moved in next door?

57
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,760
You'd pass out if you found out.

58
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,960
Should I tell you or not?

59
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,410
The person who moved in is...

60
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,750
Of all those houses under the Seoul sky,

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,290
why did he move there?

62
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,460
Huh? Did you run into Yoon Bok already?

63
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,390
He asked me to help him look for a place urgently.

64
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,730
You know he was my best friend at the academy. Right?

65
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,640
That's why I got him a place next to ours.

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,810
I see. It was you, huh?

67
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,750
Right.

68
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,840
He must've heard you putting on a show and swearing last night.

69
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,560
That's enough.

70
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,090
How embarrassing.

71
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,270
Anyway, I should tell him to keep his shirt tightly closed while living here.

72
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,400
Shit. That's enough, I said!

73
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,320
Oh-ho!

74
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,730
Hello? Hey, Ji Won.

75
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,830
Yes, come over immediately?

76
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,530
Okay, I'll be right there!

77
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,760
Gosh, I'm sorry.

78
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,130
I'm sorry.

79
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,290
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,030
Gosh, why does this keep falling?

81
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,950
Why is the teacher avoiding me so much?

82
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,970
By chance,

83
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,500
did I make a mistake?

84
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,580
Would you be able to let me in today?

85
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,490
I dressed up so much, but it is still not good enough?

86
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,710
Why? Why? Why?

87
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,980
   

88
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,690
I have seen suspicious people entering the VIP room the last few days.

89
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,360
I have to enter, no matter what, today.

90
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,700
Why is the path of becoming a Jookdori so difficult?

91
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,880
I will devote myself to becoming one as soon as possible.

92
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,870
J-Jacob!

93
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,340
Yes, I'm here.

94
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,220
   

95
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,040
   

96
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,210
Did you sleep well? Let us meet up if you are free.

97
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,060
What? You want me to take you where?

98
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,110
I will make sure to...

99
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,420
always stay behind you.

100
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,880
How long do I have to avoid Yoon Bok?

101
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,410
What should we have for dinner tonight?

102
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,260
How about that place we didn't get to eat at last time?

103
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,060
Seongsan Hall? I thought you couldn't make a same-day reservation.

104
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,640
It'd be nice if someone could wait in line for us.

105
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,890
Hong Do.

106
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,420
Yes.

107
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,480
Could you make a reservation for us at Seongsan Hall?

108
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,480
Me?

109
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Well, we're not asking you a personal favor.

110
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
We wanted to have a work dinner there.

111
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,100
We wanted to discuss the post-production. It's for work.

112
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,590
For work?

113
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,970
Okay, I will.

114
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,100
Hold on, I'll add an accessory.

115
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,550
What is it?

116
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,360
- Let's start. 
 - Okay.

117
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,150
   

118
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,320
No, not this one.

119
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,550
It's okay. It's okay. Don't you trust me? You want to quit?

120
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,000
But this is a bit—

121
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,070
It's done. It's done!

122
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,170
No, not this. I-I can't do this...

123
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,080
- Come on! 
 - No, no.

124
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,830
How about something less intense?

125
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,180
Good, good.

126
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,800
How could I dress so flashily?

127
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,810
You said you wanted to go to the club.

128
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,920
You have to trust me and follow my lead, then.

129
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,450
But this is a bit...

130
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,490
I'll put the robe back on and implore them at the door again.

131
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,330
Come on! You wore the school uniform instead of the robe in school.

132
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,800
A student needs to do so out of courtesy when in school.

133
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,230
Bingo.

134
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,770
If wearing the school uniform is a courtesy,

135
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,650
dressing like this is a courtesy toward the club.

136
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,150
How does that make sense?

137
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,760
Okay.

138
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,990
I was too harsh on you from the beginning.

139
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,750
Let's tone it down slightly, then.

140
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,250
Tone it down a little more.

141
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,300
How could I tone it down more than this?

142
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,930
I'll just go with that, then.

143
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
- Name for the reservation, please. 
 - Lee Do Yeong.

144
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,520
Come this way.

145
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,990
Deputy Lee!

146
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,340
What took you so long?

147
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,810
I love you so much.

148
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,800
Do Yeong, when did you prepare an event like this? I'm so moved.

149
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,980
 Deputy Lee Do Yeong is treating us to dinner tonight. 

150
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,370
 I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. 

151
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,680
   

152
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,820
Okay, applaud! Applaud!

153
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,840
Have a seat. Have a seat.

154
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,340
It was Kim Hong Do, wasn't it?

155
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,910
It seems so.

156
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,070
 Lee Do Yeong! Lee Do Yeong! 

157
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,960
   

158
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,850
   

159
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,510
Yes, Ji Won. Where are you?

160
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,000
Didn't you go to the work dinner?

161
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,990
Work dinner just means more work to interns.

162
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,620
We need to relieve stress at times like this.

163
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,040
The club? If you have money for that...

164
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,230
Oh? It's free?

165
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,240
Where is it?

166
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,660
Okay, I'll be there.

167
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,710
   

168
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,640
Friend. Friend. My friend.

169
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,460
Oh, a friend?

170
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,200
F-Friend.

171
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Friend?

172
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,370
Thank you.

173
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,050
   

174
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,380
Thank you. I'll be sure to return this favor.

175
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,430
Well, okay, okay.

176
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,090
Teacher?

177
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,720
Hello, Teacher.

178
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,760
We meet again.

179
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,650
Yoon Bok!

180
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,930
What brings you here?

181
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,060
Well, I stopped by to tend to some business.

182
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,690
Oh, really?

183
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,450
Running into you here makes me want to die—

184
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,820
I'm so happy I could die!

185
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,590
    
  There's a place I didn't get to check. 

186
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,170
 It is called a "VIP-only zone." 

187
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,800
 I attempted entering, 

188
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,370
 but they stopped me, saying not just anyone can enter. 

189
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,620
I am sorry, but I need to go now.

190
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,920
Okay, okay. Bye!

191
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,340
- Gosh, what do I do? 
 - Who's that? Who's that?

192
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,220
- Let's go! 
 - Gosh, no!

193
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,780
It's peak time right now!

194
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,950
- Let's go, I said! 
 - No, I want to stay longer. Stay longer!

195
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Hey, what are you doing?

196
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm sorry.

197
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,040
 It's toward the back of room No. 5 on the VIP floor. 

198
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,410
- It's really happening today. 
 - Ji Won, let's go!

199
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,000
What did you say?

200
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,450
Let's go, I said!

201
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,670
No, it's the peak time right now!

202
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,330
Excuse me.

203
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,280
Excuse me.

204
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,220
Excuse me.

205
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,850
   

206
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,770
I'm sorry.

207
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,540
- Come here. 
 - Whoa!

208
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,390
- Hey! 
 - Pardon?

209
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,590
An eye for an eye,

210
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,890
a foot for a foot. Give me.

211
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,980
Pardon?

212
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,090
Give me your foot!

213
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,500
Hey, hey.

214
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,990
 A VIP? 

215
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,730
To say, "An eye for an eye, a foot for a foot,"

216
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,050
isn't the size difference too great?

217
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,980
W-Who are you?

218
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,340
What's with you? Are you his girlfriend?

219
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,760
I was just passing by.

220
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,520
I wanted to ignore it because I'm busy,

221
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,630
but my boss told me not to ignore injustice.

222
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,490
Shit.

223
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,260
Hey! B-Boss told you not to cause trouble.

224
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,200
Let's go!

225
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,090
I-I'll see you next time. Okay?

226
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,060
- Are you okay? 
 - Well, yes.

227
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,580
I'll escort you back safely.

228
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,600
Don't get discouraged just because you're a weak man.

229
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,100
Strong woman.

230
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,640
Tell me your name, at least.

231
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,120
Kim Hong Hak!

232
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,410
What's with them?

233
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,920
Hey.

234
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,420
Yes?

235
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,930
- What? 
 - Shit.

236
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,320
Are you Gamjjok?

237
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,100
I don't know stuff like that.

238
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,990
Looks like you aren't one of them.

239
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,360
Remove this rope, will you?

240
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,830
What the heck? Who's this now?

241
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,230
Who are you?

242
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,120
Are you Gamjjok or Gamjjok's underlings?

243
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,850
Do you have no fear at all?

244
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,170
Who are you?

245
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,830
You are very rude people.

246
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,230
Are you the thief who steals treasures?

247
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,880
I take pride in being a gangster.

248
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,770
We use our fists, but we don't steal.

249
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,950
Young Master!

250
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,850
Yoon Ah!

251
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,030
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah!

252
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,530
Those bastards. Screens, ceramics, and the Buddha statue.

253
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,680
They stole a variety of things.

254
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,820
By the way, that man is...

255
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,420
He was tied up inside, but he does not appear to be Gamjjok.

256
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,900
I will interrogate him.

257
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,370
Please look for the men who ran away.

258
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,950
Okay. We'll find them quickly if we go after their gang.

259
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,370
Are you okay?

260
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,870
Yes, do not worry.

261
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,700
Where do you live? I will take you there.

262
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,160
I don't know about Gamjjok or whatever.

263
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,630
I just moved stuff because they said it'd pay well.

264
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,090
And my client gave this to me.

265
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,870
Who is that client?

266
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,580
I don't know.

267
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,410
I just get texts from a burner phone. There's no way to know.

268
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,200
Anyway, I'm innocent.

269
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,230
It says on my face.

270
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,520
"Innocent person. A good citizen."

271
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,830
Why were you held hostage if you're so innocent?

272
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,870
The thing is...

273
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,500
I saw something...

274
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,870
I wasn't supposed to see.

275
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,210
   

276
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,250
   

277
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,790
What is wrong?

278
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,970
Have you seen this man's face?

279
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,750
Get home safely.

280
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,270
Thank you.

281
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,790
Let us go.

282
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,560
Who are you?

283
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,870
Are you okay?

284
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,020
I...

285
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,160
remember.

286
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,980
Leave.

287
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,930
Yes, sir.

288
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,350
That man had a...

289
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,730
burn mark on his arm.

290
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,860
You broke open the piggy bank to go to a club?

291
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,080
Are you out of your mind?

292
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,090
You make it sound like only I went there.

293
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,850
We ran into each other there.

294
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,410
I went there for free.

295
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,640
And why would you bring Yoon Bok there?

296
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,450
Seriously, this is so unfair.

297
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,360
Yoon Bok suggested we go there. Okay?

298
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,250
Hey, come up with a more believable lie.

299
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,650
Yoon Bok wanted to go clubbing?

300
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,690
Who would believe that?

301
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,220
This is no good.

302
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,850
Let's go.

303
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,490
Where?

304
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,800
Let's have a confrontation with Yoon Bok.

305
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,250
Hey.

306
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,890
It's fine.

307
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,440
Don't overreact.

308
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,930
What did you say just now?

309
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,340
Are you telling me to care for this stranger?

310
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,410
He is hiding due to a situation.

311
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,840
Please let him hide temporarily.

312
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,200
How could I trust someone from the outside world?

313
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,560
And, Young Master, I'm a sensitive woman.

314
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,890
I cannot sleep even when an ant goes by.

315
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:14,140
I heard the singer you like is performing nearby this fall.

316
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,410
You mean my Myeong Joon?

317
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:20,380
I heard music is way more touching live.

318
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,440
You mean that precious ticket...

319
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,380
I think I could try to be slightly less sensitive.

320
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,890
Does he know how to do anything?

321
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:42,310
Make sure no one ever notices him. And...

322
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,050
let me know if there's anything suspicious.

323
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,040
This is the key to the village storage.

324
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,640
My father always carried it when he was alive.

325
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,750
   

326
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:24,600
 Yoon Bok, the Seongsan Gate opens widely for the first time today. 

327
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,660
 Remember that our village was reborn today. 

328
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:37,100
 We should have a birthday party since it was reborn. 

329
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,010
 Yes, we should. 

330
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,700
 I need to leave to tend to something now. 

331
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,510
 So let's have a party after I return. 

332
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,390
 Oh no! My goodness! 

333
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,240
 Master! 

334
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,210
I heard the key chain was destroyed by the fire then.

335
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:24,080
How did it end up in Gamjjok's hand?

336
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,770
I am not sure. Let us start finding that out.

337
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,200
Grandfather would be worried.

338
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,950
Keep this only between us for now.

339
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,470
Okay.

340
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,540
I heard Yoon Bok recovered more treasures.

341
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,700
Wow! He is talented in finding precious things like you.

342
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,360
You must be so proud of him.

343
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,970
You've been achieving great things with the country through generations.

344
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,490
I should request the president to reward you handsomely.

345
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,860
It happened because we couldn't protect what we were supposed to. It makes no sense.

346
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,010
You have a strong sense of duty.

347
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,810
By the way, why did Yoon Bok go back to Seoul?

348
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,920
He is determined to capture Gamjjok.

349
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,770
How could I tell him not to?

350
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,440
What if something happens to him?

351
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,440
I still clearly remember his father's tragic death.

352
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,480
My apologies.

353
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,240
I was just worried about your only relative.

354
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,000
Hello, Chief Gatekeeper.

355
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,920
Joon Ho, you little!

356
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,750
Master Shin Soo Geun told you to dress properly when you visit the village.

357
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,710
My apologies. I came in a hurry since I ran out of ingredients.

358
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,180
I will take the ingredients and leave immediately.

359
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,110
Let him in.

360
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,450
Thank you.

361
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,700
   

362
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,430
Yes, yes. Bring it here.

363
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,570
Lady Se Ryeong!

364
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,170
Are you okay?

365
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,150
Joon Ho, how dare you!

366
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,330
Are you hurt at all?

367
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,930
I am okay. I was just a bit surprised.

368
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,300
Are you out of your mind?

369
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,150
I told you to slow down when you enter the village in a car.

370
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,830
You almost injured another lady from a prominent family!

371
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,790
 You little! 

372
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,340
 Did you dare to make that precious child sick? 

373
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,310
You left the village without a word when you were young.

374
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,780
I did not want you to set your foot in here again.

375
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,560
But I gave you another chance since your mother begged desperately.

376
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,690
How come you are never careful and cause danger like this again?

377
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,660
Sir, please forgive him.

378
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,920
Why are you just standing there?

379
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,930
Beg for forgiveness right now.

380
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,040
My apologies.

381
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,400
If this happens again,

382
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,760
I will not let you bring a car in here again.

383
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,080
Keep that in mind, and be careful.

384
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,790
Okay.

385
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,780
Let us go, Se Ryeong.

386
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,410
The old man hasn't changed.

387
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,420
You little. How dare you talk about him like that?

388
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,470
What are you doing here?

389
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,390
I came for a reason, obviously.

390
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,320
My work life has been very interesting, thanks to you.

391
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,560
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm sorry, Kim Hong Do.

392
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,590
So, please...

393
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,730
quit your job. I'm begging you.

394
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,800
What?

395
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,720
I feel uncomfortable because of you, and I can't work.

396
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,730
I apologized because you told me to.

397
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,360
You should do me a favor, too.

398
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,560
Wow, you never fail to exceed my imagination.

399
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,470
I'm kneeling even though you didn't ask me to.

400
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,620
So, please get out of my face, Kim Hong Do!

401
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,290
You leave instead.

402
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,610
Hey, Kim Hong Do!

403
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,830
Let me make this clear.

404
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,300
You quit if you feel uncomfortable at work.

405
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,710
I'll never quit.

406
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,630
Let go of me if you understand. Let go!

407
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,990
I said get lost, Kim Hong Do!

408
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,730
How dare you touch her?

409
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,500
You are using violence on your former lover?

410
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,320
Are you not ashamed?

411
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,590
What? How dare you butt in?

412
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,540
It's him.

413
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,180
He's the one who helped you then. Right?

414
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,160
Let's talk later.

415
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,950
What's with you?

416
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,100
What's your relationship?

417
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,350
You treated me like trash.

418
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,160
You've been seeing this bastard, too.

419
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,640
It's not like that. Okay?

420
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,090
Do not even dare to lay your hand on her.

421
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,320
Okay, okay! Let go, let go!

422
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,800
You do not have any manners.

423
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Keep this in mind.

424
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,700
Manners make a person.

425
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,830
Shit.

426
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,200
Teacher, are you okay?

427
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,730
 It's Yoon Bok again. 

428
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,310
 Whenever I feel small and tired... 

429
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,130
 Are you okay? 

430
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,420
 Yoon Bok shows up in front of me. 

431
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,990
Thank you for helping me. I'll leave.

432
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,320
I will accompany you back home.

433
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,190
No, it's okay. I'll go on my own.

434
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,700
No.

435
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,990
Impolite people like him are everywhere at night.

436
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,530
I cannot let you leave alone as your student.

437
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,470
- I'm okay, I said. 
 - But—

438
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,930
I said I'm okay.

439
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,130
I said I'm okay. Why do you keep insisting on seeing me off?

440
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,050
What are you? My bodyguard or something?

441
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,260
Why do you keep showing up and helping me?

442
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,000
I said I'll go on my own.

443
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,270
I can go myself.

444
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,500
 Yoon Bok, you don't have to be embarrassed for being a bit different. 

445
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,710
 Whether people like it or not, 

446
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,950
 you're plenty cool as you are. 

447
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,110
 I came out in the world confidently, thanks to her. But why... 

448
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,940
is she avoiding me so much?

449
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,780
 By chance... 

450
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,960
 It's been so long. 

451
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,640
 Has it been seven years? 

452
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,050
 Yes. 

453
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,670
 L-Long time, no see. 

454
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,120
 I dared to approach her with a lie and... 

455
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,910
 I wanted to give you these flowers. 

456
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,950
 It is my gratitude as your student. Please take it. 

457
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,540
 Gosh, seriously. 

458
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,620
 Did you sleep soundly last night, Teacher? 

459
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,320
 I kept showing up out of nowhere and made her nervous. 

460
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,640
 I'm okay, I said. 

461
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,960
 I said I'm okay. Why do you keep insisting on seeing me off? 

462
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,740
 What are you? My bodyguard or something? 

463
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,450
 Why do you keep showing up and helping me? 

464
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,330
 I dared to make her feel uncomfortable and angry. 

465
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,280
H-How foolish...

466
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,530
I dared to be so impolite to her.

467
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,950
Was I too harsh with him?

468
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,390
Gosh, you scared me!

469
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,120
Yoon Bok.

470
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,820
What are you doing here?

471
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,670
Get up right now.

472
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,230
I cannot do that.

473
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,720
I committed an unforgivable sin to you.

474
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,080
I cannot get up...

475
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,250
until you forgive me.

476
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,030
Hey, what are you talking about?

477
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,710
I understand why you have been avoiding me.

478
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,350
What?

479
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,960
"Teacher and father are united in heart."

480
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,080
Teachers are like the king and father.

481
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,490
One is obligated to be polite to them

482
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,170
and never cross the line.

483
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:35,910
But this foolish student dared to cross that line.

484
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,730
You must have been so sad and disappointed,

485
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,550
but I failed to understand that.

486
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,970
Would you forgive my impoliteness?

487
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,600
Hey, what are you doing?

488
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,670
It's not like that. Get up now. Hurry.

489
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,170
I cannot do that. Until you forgive me...

490
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,580
Get up, Yoon Bok! Right now!

491
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,250
Looks like you're mistaken about something.

492
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,130
I didn't avoid you because you did something wrong.

493
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,270
If so,

494
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,220
do you mind if I ask you...

495
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,110
why you avoided me?

496
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,640
T-That's...

497
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,700
not because you've been rude.

498
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,400
It's because I was embarrassed.

499
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,830
Pardon?

500
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:53,580
Hey, I got drunk and did stuff like this in front of you.

501
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,340
How could I keep my head up in front of you?

502
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,240
As you said, I'm your teacher,

503
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,110
but I embarrassed myself in front of you.

504
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:06,570
I embarrassed myself in front of you again earlier, too.

505
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,530
That's why...

506
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,670
It is okay.

507
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,740
What?

508
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,860
You do not have to be embarrassed of yourself.

509
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,790
Whether people like it or not, no matter what they think,

510
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,920
you are plenty cool as you are.

511
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:34,660
I will pay more attention to your heart from now on.

512
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,430
So...

513
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,850
please do not avoid me.

514
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,720
Okay, I won't.

515
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:00,100
I'll never avoid you from now on.

516
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,860
I finally...

517
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,160
I finally feel relieved.

518
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,360
- Let's go. 
 - Pardon?

519
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,840
We're neighbors now.

520
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,110
But I haven't welcomed you since I've been avoiding you.

521
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,750
It's a bit late, but let's celebrate now.

522
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,910
This is a very rare opportunity. Okay?

523
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,470
I'm famous for being thrifty in this neighborhood.

524
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:36,100
I'll open my wallet only tonight. Let me know if you're craving anything.

525
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,170
But...

526
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,890
everything must be closed since it is late now.

527
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,720
There's one place.

528
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,210
My regular spot that's open for 24 hours.

529
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,910
Are you not spending too much because of me?

530
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,510
It's not like that, but...

531
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,180
you aren't uncomfortable eating with me. Right?

532
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,440
Not at all.

533
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,410
Why are you sitting there, then?

534
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,150
As I said, a teacher is like a king and father.

535
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,150
I cannot dare to share a table with you.

536
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,400
But, Yoon Bok, this is not Seongsan Village.

537
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,440
- But— 
 - You're making me uncomfortable. Okay?

538
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,470
My neck hurts because I have to keep turning around.

539
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:32,110
And didn't you say you'd pay attention to my heart earlier?

540
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,560
I-If you feel that uncomfortable...

541
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,360
I will move.

542
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,220
Okay.

543
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,980
By the way, you seem to have changed.

544
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,280
In what regard?

545
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:17,290
You somehow...

546
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,670
became more confident.

547
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,100
You look like a very confident scholar.

548
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,120
It is thanks to you.

549
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,350
You know how to flatter people, too. You changed.

550
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:42,440
I ran away then because I felt burdened and afraid then.

551
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,720
But I mustered up the courage to go back, thanks to you.

552
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,940
I remembered your teaching every day.

553
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,290
In front of fear and what I believed to be right,

554
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,780
and my grandfather's scolding,

555
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,530
I tried my best not to become small.

556
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,460
Because I wanted to become confident like you.

557
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,140
Confident?

558
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,980
Was I like that?

559
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,540
Yes.

560
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,780
To me, you are the most impressive...

561
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,060
and precious person in the world.

562
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,510
What happened to your body?

563
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,250
What?

564
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,650
This? It's nothing.

565
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,460
- I was at work— 
 - Excuse me for a moment.

566
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,900
   

567
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:06,490
Please put it on before it worsens.

568
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,990
 Whenever I feel small and tired... 

569
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:12,590
 Yoon Bok shows up in front of me. 

570
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,930
 As if he's my... 

571
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:17,790
 bodyguard. 

572
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:28,940
By the way, why are you walking so far away from me?

573
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,740
I cannot dare to step on your shadow.

574
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,050
I see.

575
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,760
Yes.

576
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,630
What do you do usually? Do you have a hobby?

577
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,810
I enjoy drawing.

578
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,360
Right. That's why you attended the academy.

579
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,000
What's your favorite food?

580
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,620
I like seasoned vegetables.

581
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,050
Seasoned vegetables?

582
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,320
Who's your favorite celebrity?

583
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,470
I have none.

584
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,560
How about a girlfriend? Do you have one?

585
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,060
I do not.

586
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,520
I see.

587
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,840
What's your phone number?

588
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,620
- Pardon? 
 - Let's stay in touch from now on.

589
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,970
No.

590
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:24,570
How could I exchange phone numbers and treat you like a friend?

591
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,770
Hey, you can share your number...

592
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,510
It is okay.

593
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:34,590
O-Okay.

594
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,930
Teacher, did you sleep well?

595
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:05,600
Oh, yes. Hi.

596
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,170
Yoon Bok, did you sleep well, too?

597
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,340
Yes, I did.

598
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:37,650
 I decided not to let anyone walk over me starting now. 

599
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,370
   

600
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,880
   

601
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,770
Losi Fashion became a hit today, thanks to Hyang Gi!

602
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,250
Lee Hyang Gi! Lee Hyang Gi!

603
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,540
Of course, you're the star of our company.

604
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,490
Watch and learn.

605
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,970
 What's that? 

606
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,960
 Well, I found it here. 

607
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,350
 Did someone leave it? 

608
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,920
I knew it.

609
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,100
Learn from me.

610
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,400
Senior, did you design this yourself, by chance?

611
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,630
It looks like it's the same as my design.

612
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,200
What are you talking about?

613
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,670
Hey, Kim Hong Do. What do you mean, you designed it?

614
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,140
So...

615
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,830
are you asking me if I copied your design?

616
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,000
Yes.

617
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,410
Hey, Kim Hong Do!

618
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,000
Look at her. Hey.

619
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,340
Do you know what amateurs always think?

620
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,260
They think they're the only ones with ideas.

621
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,910
But that's not true.

622
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:12,830
Everyone else can read the trend just as much as you.

623
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,530
Yes, I see it's similar to your personal style,

624
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,440
but you can't say stuff like that without evidence.

625
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,780
What if there is evidence?

626
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,980
What?

627
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,480
Here.

628
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,880
It's really similar.

629
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,410
What? Did she actually copy it?

630
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,160
The unmatchable Lee Hyang Gi?

631
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,020
Lee Hyang Gi, is that true?

632
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,690
No.

633
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,070
I didn't even know she was on social media.

634
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,620
She probably saw it in person.

635
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:51,300
I gave it to Deputy Lee for his birthday.

636
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,790
You gave it to Do Yeong? You?

637
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,520
That's true.

638
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,760
I saw Ms. Kim that day.

639
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,660
My gosh.

640
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,330
I met her because she said she'd write the promotional material for me

641
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:17,440
and again later since she wanted to give me a birthday present. But she...

642
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,120
seems to have mistaken it.

643
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,700
What?

644
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,900
And when I told her I was dating Hyang Gi...

645
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,840
I actually planned to eat alone with Hang Gi when we had work dinner,

646
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,430
but Ms. Kim made a reservation for everyone. She must've felt jealous.

647
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:40,370
I thought I might as well treat everyone since it happened,

648
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:46,670
but I felt so bad for Hyang Gi.

649
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,860
I promised a romantic date with just the two of us.

650
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,320
I'm sorry, Hyang Gi.

651
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,470
Is that what happened?

652
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,790
We had no idea.

653
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,170
Hong Do, how could you do that?

654
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,940
Hey, Kim Hong Do, that's stalking.

655
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,560
Hold on.

656
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,220
That's not what we were talking about.

657
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,890
The drawstring purse design—

658
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,210
I'm okay!

659
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,600
But don't do that to Hyang Gi, Hong Do.

660
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,720
Hey, Lee Do Yeong.

661
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,090
That's enough!

662
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,470
Unless you want to resign.

663
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:17,930
Dismissed! Dismissed! Dismissed.

664
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,390
- Team Leader. 
 - She's so unbelievable.

665
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,090
Excuse me!

666
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,140
 Everyone in the world is walking all over me, 

667
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:57,180
 but there's just one person who never does that to me. 

668
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,530
   

669
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:26,680


670
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:32,130
   

671
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,380
Hey, buddy!

672
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,070
How about you read a cartoon with me

673
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:42,060
and reminiscence on the old days?

674
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,880
Let us do that.

675
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,160
It's raining.

676
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,320
Did Sis bring an umbrella?

677
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,890
I'm sure she'll take care of herself. Come join me!

678
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,390
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

679
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,860
    
 ♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

680
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,130
 Yoon Bok turned out so well. 

681
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,970
 Was he always so handsome? 

682
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,790
 - Who is this? 
 - Yoon Bok, have you been well? 

683
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:17,660
 How could I keep working here when I'm accused of copying some assistant's design? 

684
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,360
 Is it okay to walk all over me, then? 

685
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,020
 How dare an assistant do this? 

686
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,960
 I'll make sure you never work in this field. 

687
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,300
 Hey, bro! 

688
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,890
 Hey, Yoon Bok. Yoon Bok!
