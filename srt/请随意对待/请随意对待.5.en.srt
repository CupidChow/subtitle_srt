Yoon-bok!

5
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,825
I missed you, Yoon-bok.

6
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,624
Why have you come here?

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,083
Me?

8
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,420
I'm here to live with you.

9
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:30,924
What...

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,718
What did you just say?

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,012
I'm going to live with you.

12
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,186
My apologies, Master.

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,521
But I must excuse myself.

14
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,315
All right, go ahead.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,614
Come with me.

{\an8}<i>Who is she?</i>

18
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,994
{\an8}Me?

19
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,747
{\an8}I'm here to live with you.

20
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,668
{\an8}<i>Who is she to live with Yoon-bok?</i>

21
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,132
{\an8}BASED ON THE WEBTOON
DARE TO LOVE ME BY SUN WOO

22
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,681
{\an8}I received a call

23
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,684
from someone who cut ties with me

24
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,978
and left me long ago.

25
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,897
Could it be?

26
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,482
No way.

27
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,113
<i>Are you...</i>

28
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,575
abandoning me?

29
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,078
<i>Is she the one who abandoned him?</i>

30
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,204
His ex-girlfriend?

31
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,415
How dare you say

32
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,460
that you will live with me?

33
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,378
Yoon-bok.

34
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,218
I can't believe how great you look.

35
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,220
You're so handsome now.

36
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,847
Look at your broad shoulders.
You've grown so...

37
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,518
I do not want to spend
a single second with you.

38
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,104
Leave immediately.

39
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,359
No.

40
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,613
I'm sorry but I'm not leaving

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,406
even if you tell me to.

42
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,784
I'm staying here with you.

43
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,036
Where is your conscience?

44
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,954
Do you not...

45
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,625
live with someone else?

46
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,210
Who?

47
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,337
Mom?

48
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,924
Whatever, I don't know.

49
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,843
I have nowhere else to go.

50
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,264
I'm jobless, homeless, and hopeless.

51
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,524
It is not my concern
whether you have a place to go or not.

52
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,694
Leave before I come back.

53
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,821
If you are still here...

54
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,659
I will not forgive you.

55
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>...three</i>

56
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,258
four,

57
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,719
five,

58
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,138
six,

59
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,973
seven,

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,810
eight,

61
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,396
<i>nine...</i>

62
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,133
<i>I did not think
I would ever see her again.</i>

63
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,094
<i>Why did she show up?</i>

64
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,599
<i>Why not leave me alone</i>

65
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,769
<i>as she has done all this time?</i>

66
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,867
<i>They must've been really close,</i>

67
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>considering she wanted to live with him.</i>

68
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,331
Hello?

69
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,458
That's not where your mouth is.

70
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,711
<i>I guess it makes sense.</i>

71
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,130
<i>Yoon-bok's a grown man.</i>

72
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,508
<i>It's only natural.</i>

73
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,470
By any chance,
do you have someone else in mind?

74
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,309
I shall inform you in time.

75
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,355
So please do not worry about my marriage.

76
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,857
<i>Marriage?</i>

77
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,610
-Hong-hak.
-Yeah?

78
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,987
Do you know anything about Yoon-bok's ex?

79
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,864
He has an ex?

80
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,952
-Who is it?
-And you call yourself his friend.

81
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,498
Wait.

82
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,125
So that's why!

83
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,669
That's what it was.

84
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,171
What are you talking about?

85
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,048
Yoon-bok going to the club.

86
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,301
It felt so strange at the time,

87
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,346
but I guess
he was trying to forget his ex.

88
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,977
And he hasn't mentioned
going again since then.

89
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
That means

90
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,775
he met a girl that night
who helped him finally move on.

91
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,610
You little...

92
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,279
Or maybe...

93
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,240
his ex returned.

94
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,954
"Why don't we start over, Yoon-bok?"

95
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,167
My creativity is through the roof!

96
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,463
And they thought I wasn't good enough.

97
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,089
They'll regret cutting me someday.

98
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,050
What? You were cut?

99
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,890
No, I meant I needed to cut a scene out.

100
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,349
Jeez.

101
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,523
FAREWELL FROM THE WRITER

102
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,774
That little...

103
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,116
Kim Hong-hak!

104
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,410
Are you kidding me?

105
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,623
Is that old man out of his mind?!

106
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,381
"It has been a while, my lady.

107
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,927
I was quite surprised
to hear from you again."

108
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,262
<i>How have you been?</i>

109
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,348
<i>I myself have been well.</i>

110
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,725
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

111
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,146
<i>I cannot grant you your request.</i>

112
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,649
<i>From the bottom of my heart,</i>

113
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,401
<i>I am deeply sorry.</i>

114
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,278
<i>Sincerely, Shin Su-keun.</i>

115
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,947
Unbelievable.

116
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,786
I can't believe there's someone
who would refuse the great Camille.

117
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,871
So he's rejecting me?

118
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,290
I'm so sorry.

119
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,167
I should've done better.

120
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,673
Hong-do Kim,
I told you not to bow so carelessly.

121
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,802
And the people at Camille
don't get fazed by such trivial matters.

122
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,429
So do not be discouraged, okay?

123
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,516
Yes, ma'am!

124
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,613
Is something the matter, Young Master?

125
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,282
You don't seem well.

126
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,743
It is nothing.

127
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,039
Would you like me
to take you home if you are unwell?

128
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,749
My home...

129
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,462
I'm sorry but I'm not leaving
even if you tell me to.

130
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,507
I'm staying here with you.

131
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,635
I shall take myself home
for the time being,

132
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,095
so just focus on the investigation.

133
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,765
-Understood.
-Jeez.

134
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:07,231
I've looked up every Kim Chil-bok
in the country and no one looks like this.

135
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,609
Either his name is fake,

136
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,068
or he got plastic surgery,

137
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,153
or he's a ghost.

138
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,154
It's one of the three.

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,407
Send word to Lady Yeoju

140
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,076
and ask if there has been
any suspicious behavior.

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,994
Yes, Young Master.

142
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,596
Goodness, my neck.

143
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,914
I swear he's hiding something.

144
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,441
Are you all out of Lecker Beer?

145
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,651
Oh, that?

146
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,530
A woman came by minutes ago
and bought every can.

147
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,098
Bye.

148
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,232
I wonder if she's still there.

149
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,706
Yoon-bok!

150
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,794
Please be careful, Master.

151
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,171
You might trip.

152
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,800
Are you going home?

153
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,594
Yes.

154
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,014
Are you also on your way home?

155
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,140
I am.

156
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,356
How was your day?

157
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,358
Anything out of the ordinary?

158
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,613
Actually, yeah.

159
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,160
It was chaos at work
because of your grandfather's letter.

160
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,624
But Madam Camille
wasn't discouraged at all.

161
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,711
She's such a role model.

162
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,256
Do you admire her that much?

163
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,342
I do.

164
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,641
What about you, Yoon-bok?z

165
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,935
You had quite a day, haven't you?

166
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,649
<i>I cannot trouble her once again.</i>

167
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,404
No, it was just like any other day.

168
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,822
I see.

169
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,286
By the way,
who was that person we saw this morning?

170
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,329
She had quite a big luggage.

171
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,748
That person...

172
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,339
is not someone
you need to be concerned about.

173
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,560
It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

174
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,311
Should we go?

175
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,146
Yes.

176
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,321
Yoon-bok!

177
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,875
I am sorry but I must head inside, Master.

178
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,127
Right.

179
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,004
Wait...

180
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,220
<i>Is this really happening?</i>

181
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,907
Why are you still here?

182
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,658
You haven't eaten yet, right?

183
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,076
Let's eat together. Sit down.

184
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,914
It's mostly food
that was already in your fridge.

185
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,291
Who cooked you all of this?

186
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,418
It doesn't taste like Lady Yeoju's food.

187
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,840
I gave you a clear warning

188
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,010
that I would not forgive you
if you were still here.

189
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,972
And I told you
that I have nowhere else to go.

190
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,433
If you kick me out,

191
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,602
I'll have to sleep on the streets.

192
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,690
So drag me out or call the cops,
do whatever you'd like.

193
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,360
Just know
that I'm not leaving voluntarily.

194
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,362
Suit yourself.

195
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,447
How shameless.

196
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,573
Stand up immediately.

197
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,825
Now!

198
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,870
I'm serious.

199
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,875
You're all I have right now.

200
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,674
-Here.
-It looks so good!

201
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,511
Wow!

202
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,097
I'm the best, aren't I?

203
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,598
Yes!

204
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,275
<i>I must tell her to leave immediately,</i>

205
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,570
<i>but I cannot seem to do so.</i>

206
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,285
You can stay but remain unnoticed.

207
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,079
Stay out of my sight.

208
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,040
Find your own place
and leave as soon as possible.

209
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,544
My kindness ends here.

210
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,262
Thanks, Yoon-bok.

211
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,617
A Camille designer
won't let something like this faze her.

212
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,327
I won't be discouraged!

213
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,707
All I need to do is see for myself
who she is to Yoon-bok.

214
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,432
I know nothing about the strong lady.

215
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,894
I need more material.

216
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,983
Actually,

217
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,111
I think I need more protein.

218
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,281
I'm just going to head over
to hand them some fruit.

219
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,201
What the heck?

220
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,120
Where did all the fruit go?

221
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,542
Who are you? Reveal yourself.

222
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,965
-Oh, it's you.
-Did you eat all the fruit?

223
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,968
There wasn't much to begin with.

224
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,019
Come on now.

225
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,313
I ate some while brainstorming new ideas.

226
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,192
I'm coming up with a series
that's out of this world.

227
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,486
You know as well as I do

228
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,906
that it takes a lot of pain
to create a masterpiece.

229
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,118
On that note,
could you order me some chicken?

230
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,746
-Half and half, please.
-What? Chicken?

231
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,831
Are you out of...

232
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,210
Order it right now.

233
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,672
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

234
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,843
Oh my.

235
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,429
It's an honor to welcome you
into our humble home, dear chicken.

236
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,977
Let me show you
around my mouth immediately.

237
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,439
Darn it.

238
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,569
It's one chicken leg per person.

239
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,028
You can't take two.

240
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,490
-How are you so heartless?
-What?

241
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,994
You should share this tasty chicken
with your dear friend.

242
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,412
All of a sudden?

243
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,582
Wait.

244
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,333
Are those for Yoon-bok?

245
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,460
Eat up. I'll be back.

246
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,463
Are you kidding me?

247
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,804
Give me back my chicken leg.

248
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,306
Give it back!

249
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,762
What?

250
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,181
No way.

251
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,771
How unfortunate.

252
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,856
Yoon-bok must be asleep already.

253
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,816
It's not even ten yet.

254
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,736
It's not polite to interrupt his sleep.

255
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,448
I guess we'll have to enjoy
the chicken on our own.

256
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,503
Our relationship
was severed a long time ago.

257
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,797
There's no way.

258
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,175
He said they cut ties a long time ago.

259
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,057
What do you say

260
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,768
we tie it back up?

261
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,203
A nobleman like Yoon-bok

262
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,373
would never do that.

263
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,250
Oh my!

264
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,763
Oh no.

265
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,063
I'm sorry.

266
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,483
I spilled some beer by accident.

267
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,687
What? Where?

268
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,439
I'm at Seongsan Village.

269
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,149
I'm here to meet the man myself.

270
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
Why are you telling me this now?

271
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,945
You better rush here if you're worried.

272
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,946
See you.

273
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,615
But I...

274
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,243
Damn it.

275
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,791
CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION

276
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,584
Are you sure you don't need me to come?

277
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,297
It'd be weird to have someone with me
when I'm meeting my ex after 46 years.

278
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,885
I'll be close by
so call me if anything happens.

279
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,386
Got it.

280
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,205
Open the gate, please.

281
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,124
Who might you be?

282
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,838
Tell Su-keun

283
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,465
that Camille is here.

284
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,719
Who did you say is here?

285
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,404
WOORIM RESIDENCE

286
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,312
Hello.

287
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,111
Goodness, look how gaudy
that woman's clothes are.

288
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,071
Oh my.

289
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,781
Let's go.

290
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,368
Excuse me.

291
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,120
Where's Woorim Residence?

292
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,998
That way.

293
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:01,708
Thank you.

294
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,172
What's that strange cloth on her head?

295
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,505
How beautiful.

296
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,927
It seems I have found
the most beautiful painting in Paris.

297
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,055
Paris

298
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,225
is overshadowed

299
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,311
by your beauty.

300
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,229
Sorry, Mr. Shin.

301
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,857
It is all right.

302
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,700
It has been a while, Lady Bok-soon.

303
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,621
"Lady"?

304
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,540
I'm too old for that.

305
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,947
Where on earth has this man gone?

306
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,075
What if someone sees him?

307
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,536
I can't believe him.

308
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,876
My goodness.

309
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,295
Hello, Administrator Lee.

310
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,381
Hello. Where is he?

311
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,840
-You mean Lord Shin?
-Yes.

312
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,770
So this is what you chose over me
46 years ago.

313
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,689
I can see why you did.

314
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,069
Why are you here?

315
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,739
I have let you know
of my decision through my letter.

316
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,201
Now that I'm seeing this place for myself,
I'm glad I did what I did.

317
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,120
I ripped up that letter.

318
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,960
You told me 46 years ago

319
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,003
that you'd open up to me just once.

320
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,049
I said I would open my heart to you.

321
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,094
I never said I would open
the gate to the village.

322
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,931
I don't need your heart.
Just open the village gates.

323
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,268
-That is impossible.
-Open it.

324
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,145
-No.
-Just open it!

325
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,063
I already said no.

326
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,609
How are you still so stubborn as a mule
after all these years?

327
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,486
Stubborn?

328
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,616
I may be stubborn, but I am not a mule.

329
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,828
It is you who is being stubborn.

330
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,253
I apologize for being late.

331
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,296
It is good you are here.

332
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,714
Answer me this.

333
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,383
Am I stubborn as a mule?

334
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,720
-Excuse me?
-Be honest.

335
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,478
You simply hold the village dear.

336
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,396
Hey!

337
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,148
Remember what you said?

338
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,442
You told me no one could bend his will.

339
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,196
That's not true, Lord Shin!

340
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,238
Administrator Lee.

341
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,532
Escort this lady out of the village.

342
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,659
What?

343
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,704
Or else I will have the gatekeeper
expel her by force.

344
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,790
Yes, Lord Shin.

345
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,303
The reason I let you go
so easily back then

346
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,349
was because I respected
your brand, Seongsan Village.

347
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,851
Though not as old as yours,

348
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,604
my brand is historic
and valuable in its own way.

349
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,190
I thought you'd respect that,

350
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,735
but it seems I overestimated you.

351
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,322
I apologize for disappointing you.

352
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,038
How could you just barge in here?

353
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,832
You need to go through me first.

354
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,961
Then you better convince that man
or I'll turn to my last resort.

355
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,380
Last resort?

356
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,257
And what's that?

357
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,883
Where are you, Franky?

358
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:58,022
I'm here, Young Master.
I'll head in for a moment.

359
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,274
<i>You may not.</i>

360
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,571
I will meet you downstairs, so stay there.

361
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,449
Okay.

362
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,832
He's gotten more distant recently.

363
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,755
Going somewhere?

364
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,966
Yoon-bok.

365
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
-Young Master.
-What is the matter?

366
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,811
I think you should go to the village.

367
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,938
Lady Yeoju sent word

368
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,566
that Kim Chil-bok
has been acting suspiciously.

369
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,902
In what way?

370
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,697
Apparently, he sneaks
out of his room sometimes.

371
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,245
I shall head to the village.
You may go now.

372
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,247
-What?
-Get going!

373
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,334
And starting next time,
meet me by that convenience store.

374
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,879
Why are you drawing
such a line between us, Young Master?

375
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,547
There is no time for this!

376
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,800
Go find out anything you can
about the case or Phony.

377
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,218
-Okay.
-Hurry.

378
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,730
Yoon-bok.

379
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,569
Where are you going?

380
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,157
Just you wait.

381
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,826
I'll change your mind.

382
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,165
Right over here!

383
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,095
Yoon-bok!

384
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,306
Yoon-bok!

385
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,276
Why does my heart

386
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,613
hurt so much?

387
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,093
<i>I've lost my appetite recently.</i>

388
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,345
-Babe.
-Seriously.

389
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,305
How could you say that to me?

390
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,933
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

391
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,935
Are you really?

392
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,439
-Don't ever break up with me, okay?
-Okay.

393
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,732
Don't ever say that again.

394
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,905
<i>It feels like I've been shot in the heart.</i>

395
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,699
How are you so pretty?

396
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,222
<i>Whenever I look up at the sky,
I feel my heart drop.</i>

397
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,558
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

398
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,978
<i>Could it be?</i>

399
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,647
Am I sick or something?

400
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,362
MY HEART FEELS LIKE IT'S DROPPING

401
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,323
I'VE HAD THIS SYMTOM FOR A LONG TIME...

402
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,033
<i>Based on your symptoms,</i>

403
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,619
<i>you may have an arrhythmia
or some other heart disease.</i>

404
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,995
Arrhythmia?

405
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,087
Please be careful!

406
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,182
Oh, hello.

407
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,643
Hello.

408
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,688
Weren't you with Yoon-bok yesterday?

409
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,066
Yes.

410
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,822
May I ask who you are?

411
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,163
-Do I have to answer that?
-Excuse me?

412
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,543
<i>To be fair,
it's none of my business who she is.</i>

413
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,460
I guess not.

414
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,591
Can I ask who you are?

415
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,301
Well,

416
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,971
I live next door
and I was Yoon-bok's teacher...

417
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,598
<i>Why am I telling her this?</i>

418
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,227
Oh, you live next door.

419
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,563
That makes us neighbors.

420
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,065
Neighbors?

421
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,068
I live here now

422
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,571
with Yoon-bok.

423
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,365
With Yoon-bok?

424
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,368
Together?

425
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,494
By the way,

426
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,915
did you cook the food
in Yoon-bok's fridge?

427
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,462
-Sorry?
-You know, the vegetables and whatnot.

428
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,882
They reminded me of the food
in Seongsan Village.

429
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,341
It was you, right?

430
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,720
It was, but...

431
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,098
Thank you for taking care of Yoon-bok
on my behalf.

432
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,058
<i>On your behalf?</i>

433
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,394
We're done.

434
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,647
See you around, neighbor.

435
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,360
I didn't do it on your behalf.

436
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,571
I just took care of him.

437
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,794
I would like to dedicate
this honor to you, Master.

438
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,128
Really?

439
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,341
Thank you, Yoon-bok.

440
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,608
I would like a refill.

441
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,281
I'm telling you,
my idea's going to be a big hit.

442
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,282
I'm sorry, Writer Kim.

443
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,618
At least give it a look, will you?

444
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,079
Please review it just once.

445
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,501
I mean, I can review it.

446
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,212
But our company
has low expectations of you.

447
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,091
To be frank, you're not
that good at drawing

448
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,802
and your stories
aren't what the MZ is interested in.

449
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,596
All you draw are male characters
who try to look cool.

450
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,473
Oh, you want MZ vibes?

451
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,309
That's not a problem. I'm part of MZ too.

452
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,310
Jeez.

453
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,854
Passion isn't enough, okay?

454
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,273
You need to be born with talent.

455
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,695
We feel bad seeing
all the hate comments you get.

456
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,284
Give me one more chance.

457
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,120
-It's about a female warrior
-Your coffee's ready.

458
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,413
who goes around saving the male...

459
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,457
Let's talk about it next time.

460
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,084
Next time, okay?

461
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,935
I did not know
you were such an untalented writer.

462
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,605
Yun-a!

463
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,149
I was also at the café.

464
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,859
The café?

465
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,322
You heard everything?

466
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,075
I just need more time.

467
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,452
I'm a late bloomer, you know?

468
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,413
Is coffee strong enough?

469
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,707
What?

470
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,669
You look like you need alcohol,
not caffeine.

471
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:46,967
Let us go.

472
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,147
What's wrong with people?

473
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,858
Why leave hate comments
and hurt my feelings?

474
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,277
Probably because your work is boring.

475
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,405
Then why read it?

476
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,867
Why do you let strangers' opinions
affect you so much?

477
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:16,038
I assumed you were only weak physically,

478
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,832
but your mentality is no better.

479
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,585
I hate to admit it,

480
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,964
but I guess I'm untalented.

481
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,050
Do not beat yourself up.

482
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,720
Strangers criticize you enough.
There's no need to add fuel to the fire.

483
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,683
And do not pour your own drink.

484
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,853
If you do, whoever you are with
cannot date for three years.

485
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,522
Sorry.

486
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,776
You may be a weak man now,

487
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,946
but someday you will become strong.

488
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,198
So cheer up.

489
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,413
You don't know

490
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,374
how cruel this world is.

491
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,254
Who says I do not know that?

492
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,134
I have my own worries

493
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,385
and pain.

494
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,387
You do?

495
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,517
I try my best at all times,

496
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,769
but I can never read
what Young Master is thinking.

497
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,815
No matter what I do,
he keeps distancing himself.

498
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,527
Is he bullying you?

499
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,113
He would never do that.

500
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,951
It is just that I feel discouraged
about my own abilities.

501
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,789
-That bastard's a jerk!
-How dare you?

502
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,834
Do not speak of him like that.

503
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,713
Okay.

504
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,190
Just a moment.

505
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,818
Why isn't anyone applying to work here?

506
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,154
-Mr. Lee.
-Welcome.

507
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,198
This way, please.

508
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,533
Please go straight in.

509
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,662
And guess what Young Master said.

510
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,749
"Do not cross the line."

511
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,251
"Step back!"

512
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,633
How is that any different
from the hate comments you get?

513
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,220
Do you know what people tell me?

514
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,348
"Did you draw this with your feet?
Just give up."

515
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,394
Forget about what people say.

516
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,522
I am going to leave nice comments

517
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,983
on your work.

518
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,447
No matter what Yoon-bok tells you,

519
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,367
I'll be on your side.

520
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,288
Good job, Oh Yun-a!

521
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:03,831
Bravo!

522
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,166
Bravo to you too, Writer Kim!

523
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,459
Bravo!

524
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,736
Come on, drink with us.

525
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,945
Here.

526
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,197
I'm sorry, but I'm on the job.

527
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,367
-Just take one drink.
-Come on.

528
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,077
I'm sorry.

529
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,080
Stop being so stubborn and sit down.

530
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,206
Jeez.

531
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,002
Damn it.

532
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,920
Let's go somewhere else.

533
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,935
Thank you.

534
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,901
Jun-ho?

535
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,946
You're Lee Jun-ho, right?

536
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,282
It's been a while,

537
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,451
my lady.

538
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,250
I'm sorry for the wait.

539
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,251
It's fine.

540
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,796
How have you been?

541
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,633
Oh, I did hear
that you're very successful now.

542
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,427
I'm just running a small restaurant.

543
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,557
Anyway, why are you here?

544
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,895
Well, I'm doing part-time work.

545
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,899
<i>You,</i> my lady, are working part-time?

546
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,320
You don't need to call me that.
I left the village so long ago.

547
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,491
And I'm doing part-time work
because I need money.

548
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,622
As you're aware,
there's not much I know how to do.

549
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,877
Anyway, I'm glad
that you're successful now.

550
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,505
By the way,

551
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,425
let me know
if you're hiring at the restaurant.

552
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,139
You're willing to be a servant
to someone who was your servant?

553
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,810
You saw what happened earlier.

554
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,230
It's tough working here.

555
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,827
It's my number.

556
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,122
Call me if you're hiring, okay?

557
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,297
SEONGSANGWAN

558
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,347
By the way,

559
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,433
let me know
if you're hiring at the restaurant.

560
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:15,749
You fool!

561
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,461
Did you cause that precious child

562
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,088
to become ill?

563
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,885
How dare you forget your place
and woo my precious granddaughter?!

564
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,430
How could a lowly servant like me
woo such a lady?

565
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,810
Perhaps she is the one
who has forgotten my place.

566
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,728
-You little!
-Goodness!

567
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,981
Please forgive him, my lord.

568
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,900
I beg for your forgiveness.

569
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,708
Why didn't she just stay a noblewoman?

570
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,520
INSPECTOR PARK

571
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,982
Hello, sir.

572
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,985
I've thrown the bait,
but we'll have to wait and see.

573
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,362
Great work, Detective Shin.

574
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,989
<i>Just to remind you again,</i>

575
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,159
the Young Master of Seongsan
must not find out

576
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,619
that I'm the undercover cop.

577
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,787
All right, don't worry.

578
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,205
Bye.

579
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,417
Okay.

580
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,957
I told you
he has been acting suspiciously.

581
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,003
Even his looks scare me.

582
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,839
Something definitely smells fishy.

583
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,218
And a rotten one at that.

584
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,803
Stay here, Lady Yeoju.

585
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,683
Be careful, Young Master.

586
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,953
No matter what,

587
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,415
I'm going to end you tonight.

588
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,674
Stop right there!

589
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,390
How did you find me?

590
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,269
You were told to stay in your room.

591
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,564
What brings you here?

592
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,858
Well, the thing is...

593
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,782
What is this?

594
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,248
Please.

595
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,878
Don't do it.

596
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,642
What is this?

597
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,317
So you are telling me

598
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,820
you were leaving your room

599
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,114
to build this gift
as a surprise for Lady Yeoju?

600
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,911
I was bored living like a hermit

601
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,497
and I also wanted to thank her

602
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,874
for feeding me every day,

603
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,418
not to mention I felt bad

604
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,295
seeing her carry
heavy objects on her head.

605
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,673
That's why I made this.

606
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,680
I'm almost done building it.

607
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,891
Please keep it a secret from her
until then.

608
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,361
Who keeps taking it all?

609
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,283
Ma'am.

610
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,159
Wait.

611
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,287
Oh, we meet again.

612
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,624
You two finally meet,

613
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,252
fans of the same beer.

614
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,769
I didn't get to properly
introduce myself that day.

615
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,900
I'm Shin Yi-bok, Yoon-bok's sister.

616
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,234
I see.

617
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:18,820
What?!

618
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,574
You're his sister?
As in you're his blood relative?

619
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,162
That's right. We're siblings after all.

620
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,622
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

621
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,459
<i>The pain in my heart
disappeared just like that.</i>

622
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,921
Oh, I see.

623
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,506
I can't believe
I didn't recognize Yoon-bok's sister.

624
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,008
I'm sorry about that.

625
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,180
Would you like to have a drink with me?

626
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,685
His ex-girlfriend?

627
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,980
You should've seen
the way he looked at you.

628
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,399
I was certain you were his ex.

629
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,361
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.

630
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,154
It's all right.

631
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,325
How old are you, Hong-do?

632
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,202
I'm 30.

633
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,245
Oh, we're the same age.

634
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,747
-I see.
-Okay.

635
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,542
Not only are we the same age,
but we like the same beer as well.

636
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,213
While we're at it,
<i>jjajangmyeon</i> or <i>jjamppong</i>?

637
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,757
One, two, three.

638
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,133
<i>-Jjajangmyeon.
-Jjajangmyeon.</i>

639
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,844
For sweet and sour pork,
sauce on top or on the side?

640
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,887
One, two, three.

641
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,097
-On the top.
-On the top.

642
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,098
That's rare.

643
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,724
Last one.

644
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,559
Cold noodles with soup or no soup?

645
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,727
One, two, three.

646
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,145
-With soup.
-With soup.

647
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,816
We even have the same taste in food.

648
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,401
Does this mean...

649
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,735
We're meant to be?

650
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,863
-Should we be friends?
-Sure.

651
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,573
Nice to meet you, friend.

652
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,242
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

653
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,418
So did you leave
Seongsan Village with Yoon-bok?

654
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:01,464
No, I had to leave alone
under the circumstances back then.

655
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,553
That's why Yoon-bok
is mad at me right now.

656
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,514
I see.

657
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,059
By the way,

658
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,438
I've noticed
you're really interested in Yoon-bok.

659
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,439
What?

660
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,234
Well, it's just...

661
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,112
We were close in our academy days.

662
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,949
I can tell Yoon-bok depends on you a lot.

663
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,743
He does?

664
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,162
On me?

665
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,047
<i>To be honest,
I used to secretly check up on him.</i>

666
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,148
-It's all your fault.
-I'm sorry.

667
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,692
Why is he alone?

668
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,402
-I don't know. Let's go.
-Let's go.

669
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,199
-Come on.
-Hurry up!

670
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,207
{\an8}DIPLOMA

671
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,669
Congratulations!

672
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,463
What do you want to eat?

673
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,596
<i>Seeing him
with that same expression every time</i>

674
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,807
<i>broke my heart.</i>

675
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,147
Here.

676
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,859
<i>But he seemed different in your company.</i>

677
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,448
When he was with you,

678
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,577
he didn't look sad.

679
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,915
-Is that true?
-Yeah.

680
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,001
So please continue
to take care of my brother.

681
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,089
Underneath his cold shell,
he's a warmhearted boy.

682
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,467
Keep knocking
and he'll eventually open up.

683
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,224
Cheers.

684
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,227
Cheers.

685
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,075
This soft serve goes down so smoothly.

686
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,953
It's the sweet and salty rule.

687
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,249
Once you eat something salty,
you're bound to crave something sweet.

688
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,546
<i>Master Kim loves that dessert.</i>

689
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,641
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

690
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,353
<i>Why on earth</i>

691
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:08,651
<i>am I so happy that Yi-bok
is Yoon-bok's older sister?</i>

692
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,946
<i>My heart feels fine now too.</i>

693
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,079
<i>No way.</i>

694
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,623
<i>Do I have feelings for Yoon-bok?</i>

695
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,603
Yoon-bok!

696
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,706
<i>Oh no.</i>

697
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,291
<i>Here goes my heart again.</i>

698
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,132
<i>I can't deny it anymore.</i>

699
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,302
<i>I think I like Yoon-bok.</i>

700
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:56,342
{\an8}EPILOGUE

701
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,510
{\an8}Do you know

702
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,762
{\an8}what love is?

703
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,516
{\an8}Love...

704
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,894
{\an8}is like a car crash.

705
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:12,066
{\an8}And I think I've been hit by a car.

706
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,987
{\an8}And the car is Yoon-bok!

707
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,201
{\an8}Oh my gosh!

708
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,135
{\an8}You didn't see that, did you?

709
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,428
{\an8}How embarrassing.

710
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,563
{\an8}<i>This is bad. This is real bad.</i>

711
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,565
{\an8}<i>I don't have heart disease.</i>

712
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,524
{\an8}<i>I'm just crazy.</i>

713
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,361
{\an8}<i>Did I share a bed with a man?</i>

714
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,071
{\an8}<i>And with Young Master's friend at that?</i>

715
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,947
{\an8}Yoon-bok, don't you miss Mom?

716
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,074
{\an8}To tell you the truth...

717
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,701
{\an8}Do not ever speak to me
about that person again.

718
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,287
{\an8}A fake goods scandal
has engulfed Seongsan Village.

719
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,290
{\an8}But did you know the "traditional" goods
they've sold expensively

720
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,416
{\an8}<i>were made overseas?</i>

721
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,753
{\an8}This is outrageous!
I cannot express how angry I am!

722
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,505
{\an8}<i>How has this happened?</i>

723
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,007
{\an8}It seems someone deliberately did this.

724
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,468
{\an8}<i>Thank you for everything, Yoon-bok.</i>

725
