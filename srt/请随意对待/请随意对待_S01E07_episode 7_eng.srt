1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
   

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,350
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,660
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,040
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,120
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,010
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,420
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:36,690
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,030
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,950
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,430
   

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,510
   

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,260
 I ran away from home for the first time when I was 17. 

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,960
 The fact that I felt pressured as the successor of the village... 

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,410
 was just an excuse. 

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,890
   

17
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,110
 There was a real reason I left. 

18
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'd like to find my mother. 

19
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,200
 I thought there was a reason Mother could not come back. 

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,470
 She quit a little while ago. 

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,620
 She suddenly called and said she'd move out. 

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,410
 Do you know where she went to, by chance? 

23
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,220
 I don't know about that. 

24
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,640
 She even changed her phone number and disappeared. 

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,850
 Thank you. 

26
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,560
 I kept missing her whenever I managed to find a lead. 

27
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,950
 Welcome. 

28
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,130
 Is there someone named Pi Hye Won here, by chance? 

29
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,480
 Pi Hye Won? 

30
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,080
 Oh, just a moment. 

31
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,730
 Finally, after a long wait... 

32
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,570
 - Hye Won. 
 - Yes. 

33
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,570
 Outside... 

34
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,520
 - I was finally able to find my mother. 
 - there's a student in a uniform... 

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,930
 Please tell him there's no such person. 

36
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,330
 Where are you going? 

37
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,330
 My grandfather was right. 

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,510
 I was abandoned. 

39
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,460
♫  Everything was you  ♫

40
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,320
 Starting with this show, Hong Do Kim will show off her talents in Paris. 

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,760
 She will be Camille's rising star. 

42
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,910
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

43
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,440
 I no longer want to be abandoned. 

44
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,290
 Teacher, 

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,160
 this is it. 

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,540
 What? 

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,880
 Please... 

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,150
 do not approach me any further. 

49
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,080
♫  Am I dreaming?  ♫

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,130
♫  I met you, who resembles stars  ♫

51
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,660
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫

52
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,750
♫  When I hold you in my arms  ♫

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,590
♫  Will you say, "It's been a while," and hug me with a smile?  ♫

54
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,110
♫  Will you say, "It's been a while," and hug me with a smile?  ♫

55
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,440
♫  Even in my dreams, meet me one last  ♫

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,890
♫  Dream in one last  ♫

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,400
   

58
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,740
A press conference out of the blue?

59
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,880
Master did not say anything, either.

60
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,720
I do not know what is suddenly happening.

61
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,030
 What was that? 

62
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,010
 What's going on? 

63
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,130
 Yoon Bok... 

64
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,680
 suddenly changed. 

65
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,110
Is it because of the letter?

66
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,060
Camille's rising star who will be working in Paris!

67
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,720
Our family's rock. Our family's breadwinner!

68
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,080
Kim Hong Do!

69
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,980
I'm Reporter Kim Hong Hak, reporting to you live.

70
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,860
Ms. Kim, how do you feel?

71
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,670
Geez, move, I said.

72
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,910
Are you already acting like a celebrity?

73
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,310
Where is it?

74
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,710
What are you looking for?

75
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,730
There must be something sharp and pointy somewhere.

76
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,550
I'll finish the interview now.

77
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm in front of Seongsan Village, where the Camille fashion show will take place.

78
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,500
A lot of you must be curious about the fashion show.

79
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,180
Excuse us.

80
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,570
Excuse us. Excuse us.

81
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,090
Welcome, Young Master.

82
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,550
Young Master?

83
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,320
Please tell us about the fashion show!

84
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,190


85
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,670
We should say it is not true, should we not?

86
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,600
The Camille effect is too powerful for us to do that.

87
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,950
The village products that were being returned a few days ago are sold out.

88
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,720
The press from all over the world are writing about it.

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,170
If we say it's not true now,

90
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,790
the fake product rumor we managed to escape will come back even stronger.

91
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,500
But if we unlock the gate like this, the villagers will feel anxious.

92
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,580
My goodness...

93
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,970
A rash decision will only grow anxiety.

94
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,520
I will carefully consider it and try to come up with the best solution.

95
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,950
How is the investigation on Gamjjok going?

96
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,120
He appears to be nearby,

97
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,430
but I have not yet found a clear clue.

98
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm Shin Yi Bok. Nice to meet you.

99
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,960
We're fully booked today, too. Stay focused...

100
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,250
and make no mistakes.

101
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,990
Okay, let's get started.

102
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,370
 Yes, sir! 

103
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,460
Put more toilet paper in the bathroom.

104
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,020
Okay.

105
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,250
 Undercover mission, day 1. I haven't noticed anything strange yet. 

106
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,630
   

107
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,590
It looked like you wanted to avoid him.

108
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,680
Come out a little later.

109
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,960
Do you have a reservation?

110
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,840
- Joon Ho. 
 - Young Master.

111
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,560
I didn't recognize you.

112
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,030
What brings you all the way here?

113
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,150
I stopped by to say hello since I was in the area.

114
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,780
Have you been well?

115
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,760
Yes. As you can see, I've been busy.

116
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,460
Are you looking for something?

117
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,360
   

118
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,470
Excuse me for a moment.

119
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,140
Hello?

120
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,610
They successfully snuck into Seongsan Hall.

121
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,470
That is good to hear.

122
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,650
Please take extra care.

123
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,230
Okay.

124
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,380
- I am sorry. 
 - No, I'm sorry.

125
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,050
You paid a visit all the way here,

126
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,840
but we're fully booked today.

127
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,690
If so, I will make a reservation next time.

128
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,110
Yes. I'm very sorry.

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,720
- Well, then... 
 - Get back safely.

130
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,270
Thank you.

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,910
By the way, why...

132
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,940
Why are you avoiding Young Master?

133
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,550
It's because I feel bad.

134
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,430
About what?

135
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,890
It's not your fault you left him behind.

136
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,980
My mom wants to see Yoon Bok.

137
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,560
But it looks like it's still hard for him to see us because of what happened.

138
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,530
It's true that we left him.

139
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,020
Do me a favor. Please keep this a secret until Yoon Bok feels better.

140
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,210
I'm not a Seongsan Village resident anymore.

141
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm your employee now.

142
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,730
Please talk to me casually, Mr. Lee.

143
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,370
   

144
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,900
 Here's the next story. 

145
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,650
 A world-renowned designer, Camille's fashion show will be held in Seongsan Village. 

146
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,910
 The entire world is excited about it. 

147
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,710
 Whether Seongsan Village will open its door to the public in 17 years is yet to be known. 

148
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,160
 There is a lot of interest in the new designer who was chosen as Camille's muse, too. 

149
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,340
 Kim Hong Do, who was hired by Camille personally 

150
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,680
 is a new designer who hasn't debuted yet. 

151
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,670
 You look so much happier after leaving Losi Fashion. 

152
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,180
 You're living the life. 

153
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,450
 Congrats, Kim Hong Do. 

154
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,080
   

155
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,990
 - Hong Do, I'm Soo Gyeong, your classmate in the 9th grade.  
 - Soo Gyeong?

156
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,410
 - I saw you on the news. You're wildly successful.  
 - How long has it been?

157
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,680
 Let's meet up sometime. 

158
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,880
 - Through the fashion show...  
 - Whoa.

159
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,130
A kindergarten classmate?

160
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,570
   

161
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,620
   

162
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,860
   

163
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,250
 Please... 

164
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,600
 do not approach me any further. 

165
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,430
   

166
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,010
- Hong Do Kim. 
 - Yes.

167
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,990
You'll have to visit the Cultural Heritage Administration.

168
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,000
Cultural Heritage Administration?

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,110
Seongsan Village hasn't even responded yet.

170
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,550
Is it okay to just proceed with it?

171
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,180
Why wait for the response? We'll do it, anyway.

172
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,520
Okay.

173
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,030
   

174
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,880
These are three pieces of cultural heritage to be returned from France.

175
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,600
Mr. Shin's hard work is finally paying off.

176
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,720
It's so moving.

177
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,160
Our cultural heritage that was circling around abroad is returning after 100 years.

178
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,910
Please make sure no unsavory incidents occur that day.

179
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,830
Oh, hey.

180
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,420
What brings you here?

181
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,760
I stopped by briefly for work.

182
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,870
I'll get going now.

183
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:30,730
♫  You faded away with the old memories  ♫

184
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:37,840
♫  I try to erase you little by little slowly  ♫

185
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:46,270
♫  The last piece of you becomes tears  ♫

186
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:53,690
♫  I don't think it'll ever dry out  ♫

187
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,290
 To me, you are the most impressive and... 

188
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,830
 precious person in the world. 

189
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,130
♫  You're no longer by my side  ♫

190
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:17,130
♫  I'm sorry I keep feeling scared  ♫

191
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,310
♫  I'm afraid we'll end up breaking up  ♫

192
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,170
 Look over there. 

193
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,580
 The sunset here is amazing. 

194
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,110
♫  I let you go  ♫

195
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,140
♫  Can I smile as if everything is okay?  ♫

196
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:04,470
♫  As if our time together never happened  ♫

197
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,740
 Hold on! Please, Mister? 

198
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,550
 Stop! 

199
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,310
 Get your hands off her immediately. 

200
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,700
 My gosh. 

201
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,410
 Teacher, are you okay? 

202
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,670
 Whenever I struggled and felt small... 

203
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,690
 Why are you so kind to me, Teacher? 

204
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,320
 What? 

205
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,040
 Come on, I didn't do anything. 

206
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,340
 It's my job as your teacher. I should've cared for you sooner. 

207
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,610
 I've been so negligent. 

208
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,800
 Whenever I felt lonely and sad... 

209
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:56,250
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end, but  ♫

210
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,820
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

211
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,940
♫  You and I back in the day, which I've been longing for  ♫

212
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:17,310
♫  How did we end up here? You're still...  ♫

213
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,450
 You will catch a cold if you get rained on. 

214
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,080
 Yoon Bok always cheered me up. 

215
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,050
♫  I'm sorry I keep feeling scared  ♫

216
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:38,180
♫  I'm afraid we'll end up breaking up  ♫

217
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,500
 Yoon Bok! 

218
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:52,300
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end, but now I'll let you go  ♫

219
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,120
 She's always been protecting me. 

220
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,310
 - Why did I do that? 
 - Why did I do that? 

221
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,890
Yes.

222
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,870
I'll get changed and be there right away.

223
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,280
Yes.

224
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,880
   

225
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,190
 I love you. 

226
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,610
   

227
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,660
   

228
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,020
Yoon Bok, what's wrong?

229
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,530
Why are you suddenly avoiding me?

230
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,460
You said you wanted to be close to me.

231
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,950
Whether it's a salty or sweet day,

232
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,230
you said you'd always cheer me on.

233
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,150
Why are you suddenly telling me not to approach you?

234
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,130
I apologize.

235
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,530
Is it because of that letter, by chance?

236
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,310
- Pardon? 
 - I didn't write that.

237
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,860
Hong Hak wrote it, but it got switched somehow.

238
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,050
It is not because of the letter.

239
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,640
What? What is it, then?

240
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,900
Why are you like this, then?

241
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,520
The thing is...

242
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,540
 If so, will you leave for Paris... 

243
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,470
 after the show? 

244
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,730
 Of course, I have to go if she'll take me. 

245
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,250
I'm really disappointed, Yoon Bok.

246
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,280
I thought you'd be happier for me more than anyone else that day.

247
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,700
I got to join Camille, thanks to you.

248
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,260
So, I wanted to thank you, celebrate together, and be congratulated.

249
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,440
But you suddenly pushed me away.

250
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,030
It hurts, and I don't know why.

251
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,490
Why are you doing this?

252
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,050
Did you...

253
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,390
feel that upset?

254
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,810
 Nothing in the world lasts forever. 

255
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,780
 Seven. 

256
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,190
 Eight. 

257
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,340
 A student in a school uniform and gat is here. 

258
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,800
 - Please tell him there's no such person. 
 - Where are you going? 

259
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,950
 The heart that was expected to never change changed easily, too. 

260
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,550
 However... 

261
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,790
 my fear ended up hurting Teacher. 

262
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,650
 How disloyal of me. 

263
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,020
It is my fault.

264
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,380
- What? 
 - I was absorbed into my emotions

265
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,470
that I did not think you would feel upset.

266
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,350
So, I would like to apologize formally.

267
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,480
- What? 
 - Please wait a moment.

268
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,190
Wait...

269
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,420
By chance...

270
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,990
- Again? 
 - "Teachers are endlessly generous."

271
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,550
Teachers are endlessly generous. One cannot even step on their shadows.

272
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,750
This foolish student dared to hurt your feelings.

273
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,450
Nothing can possibly make you forgive me, but...

274
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,950
My gosh. Are you crying?

275
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,450
Please forgive this inadequate pupil!

276
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,420
You'd better get up now.

277
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,100
I did not expect to be forgiven easily.

278
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,380
They say foolish students learn by being disciplined by their teachers.

279
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,890
What's this?

280
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,890
My heart is heavy.

281
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,240
Please do not refuse and hit me with this—

282
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,990
What the heck!

283
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,880
What's this?

284
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,720
Why would I hit you?

285
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,920
Do you want to apologize that badly?

286
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,790
- Yes. 
 - Can you do it differently, then?

287
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,720
Please ask anything.

288
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,580
Anything?

289
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,250
Well...

290
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,260
How about...

291
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,010
you grant my wishes?

292
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,250
- Wishes? 
 - I have three.

293
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,750
You have three wishes?

294
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,160
Why not? You play rock, paper, scissors three times

295
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,060
and eat three times a day, too.

296
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,890
What? You don't want to?

297
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,260
Well, it is not that.

298
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,430
I will grant your three wishes.

299
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,900
- Go ahead and tell me. 
 - Really?

300
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,730
Hold on. Well...

301
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,400
My first wish is...

302
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,050
What did you say just now?

303
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,480
It's exactly as I said.

304
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,230
Treat me rudely from now on.

305
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,670
How could I dare to treat you rudely?

306
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,640
- I cannot even speak about it. 
 - Yes, yes.

307
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,450
What you said just now. Don't say things like that.

308
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,300
"How could I dare to treat you..." Stuff like that.

309
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,550
And not stepping on my shadow,

310
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,910
sitting diagonally from me,

311
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,120
and walking far away from me.

312
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,460
Don't do stuff like that.

313
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,660
Feel free to step on my shadow...

314
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,250
walk side by side,

315
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,400
sit in front of me, and we'll share a table, too.

316
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,300
That's all you need to do.

317
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,590
I will...

318
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,780
- give it a try. 
 - What?

319
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,090
It's my wish. You'd only try to do it?

320
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,660
Okay, I will...

321
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,670
do as you wish.

322
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,150
Really?

323
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,180
Shall we share the table immediately?

324
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,340
L-Let us.

325
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,870
I'll wait outside. Get changed and meet me outside.

326
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,230
Okay.

327
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,980
Take your time!

328
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,050
Okay.

329
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,930
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

330
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,100
♫  I want to hug you but I guess I'm scared  ♫

331
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,550
♫  I hide it and try to push it away, but it's already here  ♫

332
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,330
Yoon Bok, don't obsess over shadows.

333
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,600
Just walk naturally. Naturally.

334
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,370
Okay.

335
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,600
Come.

336
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,660
♫  Come back to my side anytime  ♫

337
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,550
♫  For me, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

338
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,220
♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

339
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,030
♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

340
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,250
What are you doing?

341
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,450
I am looking for a place to face you.

342
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,070
Where you are is fine.

343
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,290
Here?

344
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,970
Yes.

345
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,910
♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

346
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,600
I know this is late, but congratulations on taking a step closer to your dream.

347
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,480
Thank you.

348
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,460
Cheers.

349
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,860
Okay.

350
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,070
I will go back there if you feel uncomfortable—

351
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,820
No, I'm okay. Just stay there.

352
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
It is your father's wish.

353
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,500
Please eat just one bite.

354
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,930
Hurry!

355
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,300
I have no appetite.

356
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,700
You have never skipped a meal.

357
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,150
But you have not been eating for days.

358
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,780
What is going on, anyway?

359
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,910
Just tell me what is going on!

360
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,150
Come on!

361
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,840
That's right. That's right.

362
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,990
Gosh, what is it now?

363
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,180
Yes.

364
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,030
What?

365
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,800
Se Ryeong is refusing to eat?

366
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,990
I suppose she felt bothered that Yoon Bok had been

367
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,450
visiting the village with a woman.

368
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,190
Goodness gracious.

369
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,370
Forgive me for saying this,

370
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,260
but how about we discuss the family affairs soon?

371
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,650
You mean Se Ryeong and Yoon Bok's marriage?

372
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:50,220
Yes. They are both at the right age,

373
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,190
and if we have something to celebrate, there will no longer

374
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,680
be rumors of a nonsensical fashion show as well.

375
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:06,310
You are not thinking of letting the fashion show happen, are you?

376
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,370
I have a plan regarding that matter.

377
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,760
I will think about the marriage.

378
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,290
Do not worry and go back home.

379
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,560
♪  Are you there?  ♪

380
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,810
♪  Are you there?  ♪

381
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,220
♪  Are you there?  ♪

382
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,010
 Yeojudaek.  
 ♪  Are you there?  ♪

383
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,960
Goodness, my legs.

384
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,970
I opened the door because you kept asking if I was here.

385
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,490
Why are you so surprised?

386
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,540
No, it's nothing. I am not surprised at all.

387
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,910
I have an urgent favor to ask you.

388
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,400
    
 Gosh, the building is taller than a mountain.

389
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,670
My throat feels stuffy here after getting used to breathing fresh air.

390
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,350
What's the problem? I like it.

391
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,210
   

392
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,090
Be careful.

393
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,300
When in Seoul, if you blink wrong,

394
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,970
your nose gets stolen.

395
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,240
Gangnam is this way.

396
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,810
- Hello. 
 - Goodness.

397
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,070
You are the Young Master's teacher.

398
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,170
I am happy to see you in Seoul.

399
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,010
Me, too. By the way, what brings you here?

400
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,490
Is Ms. Ca inside?

401
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,060
Ms. Ca?

402
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,770
Oh, yes, yes. Come on in.

403
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,740
Good to see you, Madam Yeoju.

404
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,320
I've been eager to hear from Seongsan Village.

405
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,510
So, what did the old man say?

406
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,050
Master said he would allow the fashion show.

407
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,520
Bravo!

408
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,490
But under one condition.

409
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,010
Condition?

410
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,590
I wish I could allow it unconditionally,

411
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:34,260
but I cannot make such a major decision alone without the villagers' agreement.

412
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,280
The people here are suspicious of events they are unfamiliar with.

413
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,070
So, come in person and try to persuade them.

414
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,670
If more than half of the village is open to the idea,

415
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,660
the deal will go through.

416
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:56,850
To have the fashion show, come to the village and persuade the villagers?

417
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,750
Just one moment.

418
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,400
A key?

419
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,120
I prepared a place for you to stay in the village.

420
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,590
Is she shooting a period drama?

421
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,210
Look at her hair. She's the real deal.

422
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,340
It's so funny.

423
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,010
What's she doing here?

424
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,320
It's crazy.

425
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,510
Why are you spacing out like that?

426
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,270
Are you sleeping with your eyes open?

427
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,650
I was going to make a bed and lie down here if you came a bit later.

428
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,610
Let us go.

429
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,900
Before we go, let's stop by somewhere.

430
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,650
We still have some time for the bus.

431
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,280
Where are we stopping by?

432
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,590
I need to make dinner for Master.

433
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,510
It is my fault for not knowing how to get around in Seoul.

434
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,900
I suppose I will follow him.

435
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,220
I brought the stuff you'd need.

436
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,860
Are you really sure about this?

437
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,250
Would it be colder than Seoul there?

438
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,460
I need to care for myself there, too. Right?

439
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,990
All right...

440
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,210
Hold on. What if I get bored?

441
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,050
That's what I'm saying. You don't have the internet there, either.

442
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,260
What? No internet?

443
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,180
Yes.

444
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,810
I'll need to pick up some books on the way.

445
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,160
You know I hate being bored.

446
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,450
How will you cook there?

447
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,920
You probably can't get food delivered from outside.

448
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,560
Food? I almost forgot about food.

449
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,520
You know the instant rice? The stuff you put in the microwave.

450
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,790
I need to pick up some of that.

451
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,660
Do they even have a microwave?

452
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,780
Do I need to bring that, too?

453
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,250
Are you worried I won't adjust?

454
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,810
How could I not worry, then?

455
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,880
I'm Camille.

456
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,010
If I can't adjust, I'll make them adjust to me.

457
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,840
Let's see.

458
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,710
Looks like cool tones look good on you.

459
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,160
What are you saying?

460
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,730
Try this on.

461
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,200
You want me to wear it?

462
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,590
The hanbok makes you stand out too much.

463
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,540
Everyone was looking at you when you were walking in Gangnam.

464
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,560
That's just what I thought.

465
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,380
Seriously, why...

466
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,040
Try it on.

467
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,600
What do you think?

468
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,620
Do you not notice me as much with this on?

469
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,580
You said I was all you could see.

470
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,880
Maybe you're more noticeable now.

471
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,310
I'll take those.

472
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,720
- Enjoy. 
 - Gosh.

473
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,250
Is this what I saw on YouTube—

474
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,650
This is called tonkatsu.

475
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:10,000
It's what sophisticated people in Seoul eat.

476
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,270
Okay. Using a fork and knife is important in Western cuisine.

477
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,170
Using the fork...

478
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,840
pierce it and...

479
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,790
saw back and forth. Back and forth.

480
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,250
Back and forth.

481
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,780
Gosh, what is the deal...

482
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,360
Eat slowly.

483
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,200
You'll get an upset stomach.

484
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,140
When I get more money later,

485
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,140
I'll get you one with cheese in it.

486
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,360
Should we go there?

487
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,700
Is this your second wish, Teacher?

488
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,250
No.

489
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,670
Draw me right here.

490
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,370
P-Pardon?

491
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,000
Hold on.

492
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,610
Here.

493
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,720
♫  A midday dream in plenty of sunlight  ♫

494
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,710
♫  I'm starting to miss you  ♫

495
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:40,710
♫  I follow the wind and look for you  ♫

496
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,740
♫  When the stars show up in the dark sky  ♫

497
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,790
♫  It was so very beautiful  ♫

498
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:56,810
♫  I've been picturing you in the night sky  ♫

499
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:03,130
♫  Like this, I meet you again, like it was meant to be  ♫

500
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,510
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

501
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:16,340
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

502
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,700
♫  I've been hoping for a long time  ♫

503
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,070
Are you sure you're doing a good job?

504
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,230
D-Do not move.

505
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,430
Okay.

506
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,250
It is almost done. Wait just a moment.

507
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,230
Are you done? Let's see.

508
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,540
I am not done yet.

509
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,090
Just show it to me.

510
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,250
I cannot. I cannot show you until I finish it.

511
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,090
- Give it to me. 
 - I cannot.

512
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,780
Huh? What's that?

513
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,270
Wow.

514
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,420
You did a good job.

515
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,290
Please get back to your seat.

516
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,810
Okay.

517
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,080
Here you go.

518
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,840
Thank you.

519
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,270
Do you like it?

520
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,360
Yes. It really feels like my dream came true.

521
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,290
I had fun since I got to draw again, thanks to you.

522
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,110
Really?

523
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,970
What is your third wish?

524
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,810
My third wish?

525
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,610
There's...

526
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,590
a place I really want to go with you.

527
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,810
What are you doing?

528
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,060
Can't you see this?

529
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,220
   

530
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,560
- I'm waiting. 
 - What's this?

531
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,510
"Frequency that makes your love return"?

532
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,440
   

533
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,760
When will she write back?

534
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,970
You're unbelievable.

535
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,350
Why would she write back?

536
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,970
Do you know?

537
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,950
How desperate I am for love that I'm resorting to superstition?

538
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,650
My goodness.

539
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,560
Yoon Ah.

540
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,380
   

541
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,930
Yoon Bok would be happy, right?

542
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,680
I checked all the CCTV footage with the truck in it,

543
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,430
but I did not notice anything suspicious.

544
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,790
That is so strange.

545
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,600
I will meet the delivery man and double-check to see if we missed anything.

546
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,820
You should check if there are any other issues, too.

547
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,620
Yes, will do.

548
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,840
My Lady?

549
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,910
What is she doing here?

550
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,090
Looks tasty.

551
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,380
   

552
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,960
   

553
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,950
The reason Young Master has been keeping his distance was...

554
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,140
The frequency responded!

555
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,680
Yoon Ah—

556
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,190
I am sorry. I touched you briefly due to a situation.

557
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,820
Well, then...

558
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,190
Wait, Yoon Ah!

559
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,380
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah...

560
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,600
What are you doing?

561
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,110
I want to show you.

562
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,760
Show me what this time?

563
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,850
That I'm not always weak and...

564
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,930
I can be a strong man!

565
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,280
I want to prove that to you.

566
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,610
I do not want to see it. I do not want to.

567
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,130
I've been working out really hard lately.

568
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,300
I got these muscles just this morning.

569
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,520
They might look like a quail egg now,

570
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,970
but they will turn into an ostrich egg soon.

571
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,670
I am sorry.

572
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,490
I felt sorry for you that day that...

573
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,180
I shared drinks with you.

574
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,700
I should have stopped there,

575
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,030
but I made a big mistake.

576
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,950
Mistake?

577
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:48,560
You probably do not know how hurtful a mistake like that is to me.

578
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,990
Just seeing you is painful to me.

579
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,420
Do not ever show up in front of me again.

580
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,380
Yoon Ah!

581
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,960
 Yoon Ah! 

582
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,630
Hello?

583
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,490
Pardon?

584
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,910
Yi Bok.

585
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,080
What's wrong? Is something going on?

586
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,840
   

587
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,800
Mom.

588
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,500
She was unconscious and woke up just now.

589
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,190
Thank you...

590
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,350
for keeping my kids company.

591
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,270
It's nothing.

592
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,280
They're keeping me company.

593
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,790
What does...

594
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,950
my Yoon Bok like?

595
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,950
Yoon Bok?

596
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,500
He likes webtoons.

597
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,490
- Webtoons? 
 - Yes.

598
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,900
I first met him when I was a teacher at a webtoon academy.

599
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,520
A high schooler showed up wearing a gat and...

600
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,860
so solemnly said...

601
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,060
"I am here to ask you to teach me."

602
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,210
He looked so cool when he said that.

603
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,470
All the kids were freaking out.

604
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:34,120
And then I reunited with him after seven years.

605
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,400
He said, "I never stopped being grateful for you," and...

606
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,720
gave me seven carnations.

607
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,640
My heart skipped a beat then.

608
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,450
I didn't know your mother was so ill.

609
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,250
Thank you so much for coming with me.

610
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,500
I was so scared when I got the call from the hospital earlier.

611
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:23,030
If it wasn't for you, I couldn't have even come to the hospital.

612
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,710
Did you contact Yoon Bok?

613
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,690
Doesn't he know she's sick?

614
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,600
I did tell him, but...

615
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,200
I guess he's still angry.

616
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,880
I hope she hangs in there until he stops being angry.

617
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,340
She misses him a lot.

618
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,740
Don't worry.

619
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,240
She'll hang in there.

620
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,030
I'm not sure.

621
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:10,580
Oh, the cargo was unlocked when I arrived,

622
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,790
but I assumed I didn't lock it properly.

623
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,780
- All right. 
 - Sure.

624
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,120
   

625
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,620
Teacher.

626
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,400
 Teacher, I need to grant your third wish today. ight? 

627
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,710
 Where should I meet you? 

628
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,860
   

629
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:56,950
   

630
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,270
 Please meet me here. 

631
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,440
   

632
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,140
   

633
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,480
I want to see it.

634
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,890
That tree...

635
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,530
I want to see it up close just once.

636
00:56:48,430 --> 00:57:00,200


637
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,200
Do you feel warm?

638
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,860
Is this the right place?

639
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,580
Yes.

640
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,100
   

641
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,130
   

642
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,760
It's your turn now.

643
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,040
Pardon?

644
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,130
I'll draw you.

645
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:01,060
T-Teacher, I-I...

646
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,330
Why do you keep smiling?

647
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,000
Is there something on my face?

648
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,340
Yes, there's gim on it. 
  (Means "seaweed") 

649
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,700
Do you mean to say jalsaenggim, by chance? 
  (Means "handsome") 

650
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,290
No.

651
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:40,890
It's wutgim. Wutgim. 
  (Means "funny") 

652
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,010
No, don't move.

653
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,360
I wasn't moving.

654
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,550
Come on. I told you not to move.

655
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,660
I wasn't moving.

656
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,070
Hey, you're moving again.

657
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:01,540
♫  With nervous feelings♫ 

658
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:06,680
♫  Everything was you  ♫

659
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,650
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

660
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,270
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

661
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,930
Why do Yoon Bok's eyes look so sad?

662
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:23,310
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

663
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:27,290
   

664
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,120
 I cannot forgive you, Mother. 

665
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,010
 I will leave you behind this time. 

666
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,840
 Give this to His Excellency Kim for me. 

667
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,470
 Master sent a wedding proposal to Lady Se Ryeong's house. 

668
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,980
 Young Master, are you getting married? 

669
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:42,100
 - Yoon Bok. 
 - Please leave me alone now. 

670
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,620
 Please do not get involved in my business anymore.
