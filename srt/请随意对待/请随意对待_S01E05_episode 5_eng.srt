1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,490
   

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,070
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,650
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,600
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,160
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,780
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,360
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,270
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,050
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,940
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,140
   

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,530
   

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:58,630


14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,640
Yoon Bok!

15
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,050
I missed you, Yoon Bok.

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,200
How dare you come to this place?

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,770
Me?

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,470
I came to live with you, of course.

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,860
What did you...

20
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,560
say just now?

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
I said I'm going to live with you.

22
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,070
Teacher, I am sorry, but I will go inside now.

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,240
Okay, go ahead.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Follow me.

25
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,080
   

26
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,490
 Who was that? 

27
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,020
 Me? 

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,620
 I came to live with you, of course. 

29
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,960
 Who is she that she wants to live with him? 

30
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,990
 I was contacted by the one who cut ties and left a long time ago. 

31
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,860
Could she be...

32
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,630
 Are you... 

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,550
 abandoning me? 

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,400
 She abandoned Yoon Bok. 

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,470
His ex-girlfriend?

36
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,690
How dare you say you'd live with me?

37
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,580
Yoon Bok.

38
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,350
You became so handsome while I haven't seen you.

39
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,280
You're totally a heartbreaker now.

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,030
Look at your shoulders. And you're so tall—

41
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,820
I do not even want to share a moment with you.

42
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,250
Please leave immediately.

43
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
I don't want to.

44
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,330
I'm sorry, but I won't leave even if you tell me to.

45
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,460
I'll live here with you.

46
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,380
Do you have any conscience?

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,160
You...

48
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,390
live with someone already.

49
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,100
Who?

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,420
Mom?

51
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,770
Gosh, whatever.

52
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,400
I have nowhere else to go, anyway.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,570
I have no home, lodging, or job. I'm unemployed.

54
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,520
Whether you have a place to go or not does not concern me.

55
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,670
I will step out. You should be gone when I return.

56
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,000
If you are still here,

57
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,840
I will not forgive you.

58
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,590
 Three. 

59
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,550
 Four. 

60
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,420
 Five. 

61
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,900
 Six. 

62
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,120
 Seven. 

63
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,280
 Eight. 

64
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,510
 Nine. 

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,730
 I thought I would never see her again. 

66
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,170
 Why did she come here? 

67
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,030
 I wish she left me alone... 

68
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,990
 as she has been doing all this time. 

69
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,730
 She came wanting to live with him. 

70
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,490
 They must've been very close. 

71
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,490
Huh? That's not your mouth.

72
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,090
 I suppose Yoon Bok is an adult, too. 

73
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,650
 It's understandable. 

74
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,630
 By chance, is there a woman you have feelings for? 

75
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,560
 I will tell you when the time comes. 

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,820
 Please do not worry about my marriage so much. 

77
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,180
 Marriage? Marriage? 

78
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,750
- Brother. 
 - Yes?

79
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,430
Do you know anything about Yoon Bok's ex?

80
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,180
Yoon Bok has an ex?

81
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,350
- Who is she? 
 - Don't you know anything about your friend?

82
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,780
Hold on.

83
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,220
That's why!

84
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,110
Gosh, that was it.

85
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,350
What? Why? What do you mean?

86
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,250
Yoon Bok wanted to go to the club.

87
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,790
I thought it was too out of the blue,

88
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,540
but he was trying to get over his ex.

89
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,880
But since he stopped wanting to go since then,

90
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,650
he must have...

91
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,180
met a new girlfriend to make him forget his ex completely.

92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,720
Or...

93
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,420
the ex came back.

94
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,170
"Yoon Bok, should we get back together?"

95
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,650
I'm such an imaginative artist.

96
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,590
Wow, how could they not recognize how talented I am?

97
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,990
They'll regret firing me someday.

98
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,340
What? Did you get fired?

99
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,410
I wanted to cut that scene early for some reason.

100
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,690
   

101
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,750
Kim Hong Hak!

102
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,730
Is he out of his mind?

103
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,060
Is this old man out of his mind?

104
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,510
"It has been a long while, Maiden.

105
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,530
I was very surprised to hear from you."

106
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,740
 Have you been well? 

107
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,460
 I have been doing well without any issues. 

108
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,080
 Unfortunately, 

109
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,600
 I will not be able to accept your request. 

110
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,390
 I am very sincerely sorry about that. 

111
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,620
 Sincerely, Shin Soo Geun. 

112
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,370
My goodness.

113
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,850
There's a human who says no to the mighty Camille...

114
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,580
on this entire earth.

115
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,830
You're rejecting my request?

116
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,240
I should've done a better job.

118
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,250
Stop!

119
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,890
Hong Do Kim?

120
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,590
You promised not to bow down for no reason.

121
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,880
And Camille's employee doesn't get discouraged over something so small.

122
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,890
So, don't be down. Okay?

123
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,530
Okay.

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,850
Young Master, is something going on?

125
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,550
You look upset.

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,310
It is nothing.

127
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,550
Should I take you home if you are feeling ill?

128
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,540
At home...

129
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,710
 I'm sorry, but I won't leave even if you told me to. 

130
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,810
 I'll live here with you. 

131
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,800
I will go home on my own for a while.

132
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,740
Just focus on the investigation.

133
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,210
- Okay. 
 - Wow.

134
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,800
I looked up all Kim Chil Boks in the country, but no one looked like the sketch.

135
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,310
He either has a fake name, got plastic surgery,

136
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,420
or he's a ghost. It's one of those three.

137
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,490
Contact Yeojudaek and ask if she noticed anything suspicious about him.

138
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

139
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,170
He is definitely hiding something.

140
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,500
Ma'am, are you out of Lecker Beer?

141
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,220
Oh, that?

142
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,480
Some lady just bought all of it earlier.

143
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,290
Thank you.

144
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,410
I wonder if she left.

145
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,210
 Yoon Bok! 

146
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,450
Teacher, do not run. You might end up falling.

147
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,810
Did you just get here?

148
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,360
Yes.

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Looks like you are on your way back from work, too.

150
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,930
Yes.

151
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,990
How was your day today?

152
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,460
Did anything happen in particular?

153
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,510
Of course, it did.

154
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,650
Your grandfather's letter caused a big uproar.

155
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,660
But Camille wasn't discouraged at all.

156
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,370
That's why she's my role model.

157
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,630
Do you respect her that much?

158
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,130
Yes.

159
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
How about you, Yoon Bok?

160
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,170
You must've gone through a lot today.

161
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,640
 I cannot make her worry again. 

162
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,040
No, not much happened.

163
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,490
Really?

164
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,410
Who was the person who came by this morning?

165
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,630
She had a big bag.

166
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,820
She is...

167
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,460
She's not someone you should worry about.

168
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,560
It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

169
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,470
Should we go?

170
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,220
Yes.

171
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,500
 Yoon Bok! 

172
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,190
Teacher, I am sorry, but I will leave now.

173
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,680
Well, but...

174
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,440
 My gosh, what's happening? 

175
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,280
Why are you still here?

176
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,780
You haven't had dinner yet. Right?

177
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,100
Let's eat together. Have a seat.

178
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,830
It's mostly the side dishes in the fridge, but...

179
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,910
By the way, who made these for you?

180
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,620
I can tell it wasn't Yeojudaek.

181
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,780
I warned you, did I not?

182
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,700
I said I would not forgive you if you were still here.

183
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,030
I told you, too. I have no place to go.

184
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,680
If you don't let me stay, I have to sleep out on the streets.

185
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,670
So you can drag me out, hurt me,

186
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,470
or do whatever. I won't leave on my own.

187
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,850
Whatever.

188
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,520
How shameless.

189
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,580
Get up immediately.

190
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,950
Get up right now!

191
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,890
You really are...

192
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,920
the only one I have right now.

193
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,790
 - Here. 
 - Wow, looks tasty! 

194
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,700
 Wow. 

195
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,650
 I am the best, am I not? 

196
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,590
 Yes. 

197
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,710
 I need to yell at her to leave now. 

198
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,530
 But why... 

199
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,770
 Why can I not move my lips? 

200
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,530
Stay as if you are not here.

201
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,020
Try to be out of sight as much as you can.

202
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,090
And find a place to stay quickly and leave.

203
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,630
This is the best I can do for you.

204
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,260
 Thank you, Yoon Bok! 

205
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,320
Yes, Designer Camille doesn't get discouraged over stuff like this.

206
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,310
Don't be down!

207
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:23,030
I'll just check what their relationship is myself.

208
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,500
Geez, I know nothing about the strong woman.

209
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,040
I need more information.

210
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,890
Or...

211
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,870
I need more protein.

212
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,690
I'll pretend like I'm bringing him fruit.

213
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,480
What? Where did all the fruit go?

214
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,560
Who are you?

215
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,670
Show me your face.

216
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,300
- Sis? 
 - Did you eat all the fruit in here?

217
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,150
Well, that? There wasn't that much, anyway.

218
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,300
I had to eat to come up with a new project.

219
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,750
I'm creating something unbelievable right now.

220
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,390
Sis, you know artists give birth to work by going through pain. Right?

221
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,170
Since we're on the topic, can you order me fried chicken?

222
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,420
Half and half.

223
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,990
What? Fried chicken?

224
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,120
Are you out of your mind

225
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,060
Order it right now.

226
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,710
- Do you mean it? 
 - Yes.

227
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,620
Goodness!

228
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,680
Mr. Chicken came to this crummy place.

229
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,260
I will take you to my mouth immediately.

230
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,810
Don't you know the one-leg per-person rule?

231
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,240
You can't eat two.

232
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,650
- How come you have no sense of loyalty? 
 - Huh?

233
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,310
Don't you think about your friend when you're eating this delicious fried chicken?

234
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,000
All of a sudden?

235
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,230
Hold on.

236
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,650
Are you taking that to Yoon Bok?

237
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,150
Go ahead and eat. I'll share some with him.

238
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,660
Sis, seriously.

239
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,840
Give me my leg! Give it to me!

240
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,950
Could it be...

241
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,100
Gosh, what do we do?

242
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,340
He must be already in bed.

243
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,230
It's not even 10 yet.

244
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,940
It'd be rude to wake him up.

245
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,460
We'll have to eat the chicken ourselves. Right?

246
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,550
 Our fate was cut off a long time ago. 

247
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:01,630
No. He definitely said their fate was cut off long ago.

248
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,160
 Shall we rekindle that fate today? 

249
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:32,440
No, Yoon Bok is a nobleman. There's no way.

250
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm sorry.

251
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,740
I spilled some beer by mistake.

252
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,220
What? Where?

253
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,730
I'm in Seongsan Village right now.

254
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,570
I came to see him in person.

255
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,940
How could you tell me that now?

256
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,020
Run over here if you're scared.

257
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,710
See you then.

258
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,880
Well, I—

259
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,270
Gosh, seriously.

260
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,540
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

261
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,700
I'm seeing my ex in 46 years.

262
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,760
It'd be weird to bring someone else.

263
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,580
I'll be in the area. Call me if something happens.

264
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,300
Okay.

265
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,800
Open the gate, please.

266
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,390
W-Who's this? Who are you?

267
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,630
Tell Soo Geun...

268
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,830
that I, Camille, am here.

269
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,850
What? Who's here?

270
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,530
   

271
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,420
Bonjour.

272
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,960
Gosh, how could she dress up so flashy?

273
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,690
Goodness!

274
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,120
Let us go.

275
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,380
Excuse me, where's Woorim House?

276
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,910
That way.

277
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,020
Merci.

278
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,230
What a strange scarf she is wearing.

279
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,830
 I think I found the most beautiful view in Paris. 

280
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:04,490
 I cannot see Paris since its beauty was overwhelmed by yours. 

281
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,370
Oops.

282
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,320
Sorry, Mr. Shin.

283
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,930
It is okay.

284
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,000
Long time no see, Maiden Bok Soon.

285
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,280
Maiden, my foot.

286
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,660
I'm too old for that.

287
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,310
Where did this man go?

288
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,780
What if someone sees him?

289
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,330
Geez. Seriously...

290
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,340
Goodness, you came, Director.

291
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,410
Yes. Where is he?

292
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,810
You mean, Master?

293
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,510
You chose this over me 46 years ago.

294
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,640
I can see why. I'll admit it.

295
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,360
What brings you all the way here?

296
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,170
I already expressed my position in the letter.

297
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,750
Seeing it myself makes me glad that I...

298
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,270
tore off up letter.

299
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,000
You told me 46 years ago...

300
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,070
that you'd open it once in your life.

301
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,750
I said I'll open my heart.

302
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,300
I never said I'd open up the village.

303
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,700
I don't need your heart. Open up your village instead.

304
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,400
- It is not possible. 
 - Please open it.

305
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,750
- I cannot. 
 - Open it!

306
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,820
I said I cannot.

307
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,960
How come you're always so stubborn?

308
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,720
Stubborn?

309
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,660
I may be stubborn, but I am not unreasonable.

310
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,230
- You are the one who is being stubborn! 
 - Ha! 
 - Ha!

311
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm sorry I'm late.

312
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,820
I am glad you are here.

313
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,130
Why don't you tell me?

314
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,170
Am I stubborn?

315
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,890
- Pardon? 
 - Yes, be honest.

316
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,380
You just care about the village a lot.

317
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,290
Hey! You told me before!

318
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,400
That no one can change his mind!

319
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,150
No, it's not that! No, sir...

320
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,480
Director Lee, get this woman out of the village immediately.

321
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,730
What?

322
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,290
Before I make Chief Gatekeeper force her out! Hurry!

323
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,860
Okay.

324
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,280
I let you go back then because...

325
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,170
I respected your brand, Seongsan Village.

326
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,100
It might not be as old as yours,

327
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,230
but my brand has tradition and value, too.

328
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,160
I thought you'd respect that.

329
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,440
I think I overestimated you.

330
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,250
I am sorry to disappoint you.

331
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,260
You can't just barge in like this.

332
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,190
You should've taken the proper steps through me—

333
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,260
Convince me with proper steps now.

334
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,030
Otherwise, I'll use the final solution.

335
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,100
What? Final solution?

336
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,420
What's that?

337
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,870
Frankie, where are you?

338
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,320
Young Master, I am in front of your place. I will come up briefly.

339
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,030
 You cannot. 

340
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,670
I will come down. Stay right there

341
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,470
Well, okay.

342
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,920
Young Master is enforcing boundaries these days.

343
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,250
Are you going somewhere?

344
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,020
Yoon Bok.

345
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,850
- Young Master. 
 - What is this about?

346
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,770
I think I need to stop by the village.

347
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,600
I was contacted by Yeojudaek.

348
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,650
She says Kim Chil Bok is acting suspiciously.

349
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,510
In what way?

350
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,650
He sometimes leaves the room secretly, apparently.

351
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,980
I will go to the village. You can leave now.

352
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,700
- Pardon? 
 - Leave now, I said.

353
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,680
And contact me at the convenience store from now on.

354
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,920
Pardon? Young Master, how could you be like this—

355
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,770
Come on. There is no time for this.

356
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,990
Hurry up and look into the case 17 years ago or the evidence of Gamjjok or whatever.

357
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,150
- Okay. 
 - Hurry.

358
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,750
Yoon Bok.

359
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
Yoon Bok, where are you going?

360
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,500
Just wait a moment.

361
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,850
I'll change your mind.

362
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Over here!

363
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,170
 Yoon Bok. 

364
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,280
 Yoon Bok! 

365
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,890
Why does...

366
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,510
it keep hurting here?

367
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,110
 I have no appetite these days. 

368
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,590
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

369
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,820
We can't break up. Okay?

370
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,730
Promise to never do that again.

371
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,910
 My heart aches as if I got shot. 

372
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:02,310
♫  I'm sorry I keep feeling scared  ♫

373
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,450
♫  I'm afraid we'd end up breaking up  ♫

374
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:15,980
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end, but  ♫

375
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,380
 My heart skips a beat whenever I look up in the sky. 

376
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,470
 What's wrong with me? 

377
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,170
 By chance... 

378
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,680
Am I sick or something?

379
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,860
   

380
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,150
 Your symptom makes me suspect arrhythmia or other heart conditions. 

381
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,910
Arrhythmia?

382
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,270
Hello!

383
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,090
Hello.

384
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,340
Hello.

385
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,470
You're the one who was with Yoon Bok yesterday. Right?

386
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,880
Yes.

387
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,750
By the way, who are you?

388
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,680
Do I have to answer that?

389
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,220
Pardon?

390
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,440
- Pardon? 
  - Right, their relationship is none of my business. 

391
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,930
- How about you? Who are you? 
 - Well...

392
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,670
I'm Yoon Bok's teacher, who lives next door...

393
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,680
 Why am I answering her question? 

394
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,210
You lived next door.

395
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,030
That makes us neighbors.

396
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,480
Neighbors?

397
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,810
I'll be living here.

398
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,540
With Yoon Bok.

399
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,980
Yoon Bok...

400
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,770
Together?

401
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:09,120
By chance, did you make the side dishes in his fridge?

402
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,940
- Pardon? 
 - Vegetables and his other favorites.

403
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,090
You made them in Seongsan Village style.

404
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,460
It was you, wasn't it?

405
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,050
Yes, I did, but...

406
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,180
Thank you for taking care of him on my behalf.

407
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,100
 On her behalf? 

408
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,440
We're all done.

409
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,550
See you again, Neighbor.

410
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,440
I didn't take care of him on her behalf.

411
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,620
I just cared for him.

412
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,490
♫  I'm sorry I keep feeling scared  ♫

413
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:57,600
♫  I'm afraid we'd end up breaking up  ♫

414
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:05,960
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end, but  ♫

415
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,190
♫  I'm letting you go now  ♫

416
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,020
 I want to dedicate this to you. 

417
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,710
 Really? 

418
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,420
 Thank you, Yoon Bok. 

419
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,620
I'd like another refill.

420
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,480
I found killer material, I said.

421
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

422
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,740
Come on. Don't say no without even seeing it.

423
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,690
Just once. Please look at it just once.

424
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,860
Please.

425
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,700
I can have a look at it,

426
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,150
but the company has no faith in you.

427
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,390
To be honest, your drawing skills aren't spectacular

428
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,210
and your stories don't meet the MZers' taste. 
  (Millenials and Gen Z'ers) 

429
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,940
It's always about men trying to act cool.

430
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,570
You wanted an MZ style.

431
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,320
I can do it. I'm an MZ myself.

432
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,960
Passion only won't fix the issue.

433
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,490
You need to have a natural talent, but...

434
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,880
We feel bad whenever we see hate comments. That's why.

435
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,450
It'll be different this time. It's about the Joseon era...

436
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,330
Here's your coffee.

437
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,630
She kicks him like this...

438
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,340
Okay, next time. Next time.

439
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,070
Let's talk next time.

440
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,950
Were you that hopeless of an artist?

441
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,470
Yoon Ah!

442
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,890
At the cafe earlier...

443
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,410
Cafe...

444
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,810
Oh, you heard everything.

445
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,340
I'm just not recognized yet.

446
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,410
I tend to be a late bloomer.

447
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,570
Will coffee be enough?

448
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,780
Pardon?

449
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,850
Looks like you need alcohol more than caffeine.

450
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,880
Let us go.

451
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,400
Why are people like that?

452
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,260
Why do they leave comments? It's so hurtful.

453
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,340
They do because they do not find it fun.

454
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,620
Don't read it, then.

455
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,510
Why get hurt by comments from strangers?

456
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,180
I thought you were just physically weak,

457
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,780
but are you weak in spirit, too?

458
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,390
I don't want to admit it,

459
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,970
but I guess I really have no talent.

460
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,460
Do not blame yourself.

461
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,790
You even get hurt by people's criticism. Why criticize yourself?

462
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,500
Do not pour yourself a drink, either.

463
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,580
You would prevent your company from dating for three years.

464
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,170
Oh, sorry.

465
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,790
You might be a weak man now,

466
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,250
but you can become a strong man someday, too.

467
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,950
Cheer up.

468
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,210
You don't understand...

469
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,500
how cruel this world is.

470
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,410
Who says I do not?

471
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,280
I have a lot of worries, too.

472
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,520
I get hurt a lot, too.

473
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,500
You do?

474
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,700
I always try my best,

475
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,780
but I cannot tell how Young Master feels.

476
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,840
No matter how devoted I am, he keeps a distance from me.

477
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,280
Does Yoon Bok make you feel left out?

478
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,200
The exceptional Young Master would not do that.

479
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,750
I just blame my inability.

480
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,230
Wow, what a bastard he is.

481
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,590
Come on.

482
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,830
Do not talk about Young Master that way.

483
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,250
Just one moment. Just one moment.

484
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,920
I posted the job ad forever ago.

485
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,370
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Hello, sir. This way. Come on in.

486
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,480
Go all the way in.

487
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,600
Do you know what he said to that?

488
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,060
"Do not cross the line!

489
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,190
Step back!"

490
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,250
How is that different from hate comments?

491
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,900
Do you know what people say?

492
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,710
"Did you draw with your foot? Quit drawing."

493
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:50,040
No matter what people say, I will post a positive comment to your series.

494
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,920
No matter what Yoon Bok says,

495
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,660
I will cheer for you, Yoon Ah.

496
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,340
Good work, Oh Yoon Ah! Bravo!

497
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,470
Bravo, Mr. Kim!

498
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,320
Bravo!

499
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,650
Have a seat and join us, I said. Here.

500
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,350
I'm sorry. I'm working right now.

501
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,530
- Come on. Just one drink. 
 - Take it.

502
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,250
- I'm sorry. 
 - Come on!

503
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,120
Stop acting stuffy and take it.

504
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,980
What is she... Let's move.

505
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,880
Thank you.

506
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,250
Joon Ho?

507
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,190
Lee Joon Ho. It's you, isn't it?

508
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,580
Long time no see...

509
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,280
My Lady.

510
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,380
I'm sorry for making you wait.

511
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,280
Not at all.

512
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,270
How have you been?

513
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,080
Right, I did hear you became successful.

514
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,590
I'm just running a small restaurant.

515
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:47,080
By the way, what are you doing here?

516
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,390
Me? I'm just working part-time, you know.

517
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,340
You're working part-time, My Lady?

518
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,740
My Lady, my foot. I left the village a long time ago.

519
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,520
And why else would I work part-time?

520
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,590
I'm trying to make money.

521
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,850
As you know, I don't have many skills.

522
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,950
Anyway, I'm glad you became successful, at least.

523
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:20,520
Oh, hire me if you need a part-timer at the restaurant.

524
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,190
You want to become a servant to your old servant?

525
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,840
You saw it earlier, too.

526
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,160
It's not easy here, either.

527
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,920
Here's my number.

528
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,270
Call me if you need a part-timer. Okay?

529
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,230
   

530
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,320
 Oh, hire me if you need a part-timer at the restaurant. 

531
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,780
   

532
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,320
 You bastard! 

533
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,350
 How dare you make the precious child sick? 

534
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,310
 Without knowing your place, 

535
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,660
 you seduced my granddaughter and put her in this mess! 

536
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,550
 I'm a lowly servant. How could I dare to seduce My Lady? 

537
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,180
 My Lady must have forgotten my status. 

538
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,470
 - You bastard! 
 - Gosh! 

539
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,080
 I am sorry, sir. 

540
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,030
 I am sorry. I am sorry. 

541
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,730
She should have stayed noble.

542
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,920
   

543
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,660
   

544
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,290
Yes, Senior. I set the bait, but we should wait and see if he bites.

545
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,540
Gosh, good work, Detective Shin.

546
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,180
 Let me make this extra clear. 

547
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,710
You can't tell the Young Master of Seongsan Village that I'm an undercover cop.

548
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,400
 Okay, okay. Don't worry. 

549
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,020
Sure.

550
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,370
Okay.

551
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,110
See? I said he was suspicious.

552
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,900
He has a scary face, too.

553
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,220
I can definitely smell something.

554
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,670
Something smells really fishy.

555
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,830
Stay here, Yeojudaek.

556
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,790
Be careful, Young Master.

557
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,800
I'll...

558
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,390
finally finish you today.

559
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,610
Stop!

560
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,330
What are you doing here?

561
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,140
I told you to stay in the room.

562
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,430
What are you doing out here?

563
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,860
Well...

564
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,720
What's in here?

565
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,480
Please...

566
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,860
Don't do that.

567
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,720
W-What is this?

568
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,930
So, to surprise Yeojudaek,

569
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,160
you've been making this all this time?

570
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,510
I found doing nothing was boring...

571
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:08,400
and I wanted to return the favor since she cooks every meal for me.

572
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,470
She always carries stuff on her head. I felt bad for her for that, too.

573
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,250
So...

574
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,750
It needs a few more touches until it's done.

575
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,920
Keep it a secret until then, please.

576
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,460
Who keeps buying all of it?

577
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,380
Ma'am...

578
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,380
We meet again.

579
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,760
Goodness, you finally met.

580
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,730
The ones who like the same beer.

581
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,900
I didn't get to introduce myself properly last time.

582
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,230
I'm Yoon Bok's older sister, Shin Yi Bok.

583
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,480
Oh, I see.

584
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,110
Pardon?

585
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,980
Older sister? Related by blood?

586
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,710
Yes, we're related since I'm his sister.

587
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:34,010
 What was that? My heart pain suddenly disappeared. 

588
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,080
Gosh, I see.

589
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,620
I didn't know you were his sister.

590
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,120
Please forgive me.

591
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,310
Would you like to join me for a beer?

592
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,790
Ex-girlfriend?

593
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,080
He looked at you so intensely.

594
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,610
So I was sure you were his ex.

595
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,240
Thinking now, I was a bit biased.

596
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,130
It's okay.

597
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,700
By the way, how old are you, Hong Do?

598
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,540
Well, I'm 30.

599
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,400
Gosh, we're the same age.

600
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,620
We're the same age, and we like the same beer.

601
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,390
Let me ask you. What do you like between jjajang and jjambbong?

602
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,000
One, two, three.

603
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,810
- Jjajang. 
 - Jjajang.

604
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:26,140
Tangsuyuk. Pour or dip? One, two, three.

605
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,640
- Pour. 
 - Pour. How unusual.

606
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,400
The last one is about naengmyeon.

607
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,930
Water or spicy. One, two, three.

608
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,700
- Water. 
 - Water.

609
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,350
Even our preferences match?

610
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,860
I guess we could say...

611
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,440
It's destiny?

612
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,510
- Should we be friends? 
 - Okay.

613
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,160
Nice to meet you, friend.

614
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,140
Cheers.

615
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,090
Did you leave Seongsan Village with Yoon Bok, then?

616
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:03,190
No, I left him behind and lived outside for a reason.

617
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:08,050
That's why he's a bit angry at me right now.

618
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,550
Oh, I see.

619
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,800
By the way, you're very interested in him, Hong Do.

620
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,250
Huh?

621
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,480
No, it's because I was close to him as a student.

622
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,700
He seems to rely on you a lot, too.

623
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,650
He does?

624
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,930
Me?

625
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,160
To be honest, I went to see him sometimes.

626
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:01,310
 Hey, what's wrong with you? It's your fault... 

627
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,820
 Why is he on his own? 

628
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,490
 I don't know. Let's go. 

629
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,340
 Hurry! Hurry! 

630
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,330
   

631
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,980
 Congratulations. 

632
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,580
 Let me buy you something tasty. What would you like? 

633
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:32,540
He was making the same face whenever I saw him.

634
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,750
It broke my heart, but...

635
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,630
 Here. 

636
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:45,920
He was different whenever he was with you.

637
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:51,400
At least in front of you, he...

638
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,560
didn't look sad anymore.

639
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,930
- Really? 
 - Yes.

640
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,030
Take good care of my brother from now on, too.

641
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:06,820
He acts cold, but he's warm inside.

642
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,440
He'll open up if you keep approaching him.

643
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,640
Cheers.

644
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,000
 Why is this so easy to eat? 

645
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,170
 Don't you know "Sweet-salty-sweet-salty"? 

646
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,220
 You crave something sweet after eating something salty. 

647
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,600
 Teacher likes this, too. 

648
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:59,970
So confusing. So confusing.

649
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:03,230
 Why? Why on earth? 

650
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:10,330
 Why am I so happy that Yi Bok was Yoon Bok's sister? 

651
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,040
 My heart doesn't ache anymore, either. 

652
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,620
 By chance, do I like Yoon Bok? 

653
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,360
Yoon Bok!

654
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,190
 There goes my heart again. 

655
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:17,350
 I think I like Yoon Bok. 

656
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,420
♫  When the stars show up in the dark sky  ♫

657
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:31,430
♫  It was so very beautiful  ♫

658
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:38,420
♫  I've been picturing it in the sky  ♫

659
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:44,640
♫  Like this, I meet you again, like it was meant to be.  ♫

660
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,950
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

661
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:56,460
   

662
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,750
Do you know what love is?

663
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,280
Love is...

664
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,010
like a car accident, apparently.

665
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,910
I think I got hit by a car.

666
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,110
A car with Yoon Bok in it.

667
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,000
My gosh!

668
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:37,920
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

669
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,210
You didn't see that. Right?

670
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:42,310
So embarrassing.

671
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,490
♫  For me, if it's you  ♫

672
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:48,660
   

673
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,700
 This is an accident. A major accident. 

674
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,760
 My heart wasn't ill. It just went crazy. 

675
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,030
 I slept with a man? With Young Master's friend, even? 

676
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:01,150
 Yoon Bok, don't you miss Mom? To be honest, she... 

677
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,900
 Don't ever bring her up in front of me again. 

678
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,380
 Seongsan Village is being accused of selling fake products. 

679
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,690
 Their expensive, traditionally made products turned out to be imported from abroad? 

680
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,110
 How does this make sense? This is so unfair and frustrating! 

681
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,710
 What happened, exactly? 

682
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,390
 I think someone intended to do this. 

683
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,790
 Yoon Bok, thank you for everything. 

684
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:24,550
 You have no idea how dependable you are to me. 

685
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:27,130
 - What's this? 
 - Sis, haven't you seen my letter? 

686
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,900
 What? What do I do? 

687
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,100
 Hey, what did you write in that letter? 

688
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:36,580
 Me? I wrote, "I love you." 

689
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,350
 What?
