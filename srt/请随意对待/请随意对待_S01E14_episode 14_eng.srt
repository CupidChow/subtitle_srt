1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
   

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,450
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,670
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,270
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,190
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,750
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,310
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,060
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,580
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,330
   

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,550
   

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,240
Okay. Three, two, one. Go.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,280


15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,400
Cut. Stop.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,160
Is something wrong?

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,940
Again, again.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,170
Be natural.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,390
Okay.

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,090
Yes, walk just like that. Just like that.

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,100
Exactly like that.

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,140
Okay.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,900
Just like this.

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,760
Go.

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,990
I told you to walk like just now. Be natural.

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,950
I thought I was walking the same way.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,950
Wow.

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,070
There's something you aren't good at, Yoon Bok.

29
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,810
Okay, look closely.

30
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,440
Look far away and...

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,820
walk naturally.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,570
Bam. Bam.

33
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,350
And turn.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,890
You can't do this?

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,240
Let me try it again.

36
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,080
Go.

37
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,870
Bam.

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,420
Bam.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,380
I am sorry.

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,370
No, it's okay.

41
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,180
No one's good from the beginning.

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,360
And you know...

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,100
We have time.

44
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,310
You are not even a model. Why are you so good?

45
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,420
It's because I've seen it a lot.

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,230
Yoon Bok, look.

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,750
Yoon Bok, modeling is all about confidence.

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,510
No matter what anyone says, be confident and proud.

49
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,820
Walk like this.

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,670
Look sexy like this.

51
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,730
Be confident like this.

52
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,250
And turn. Gosh!

53
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,920
Teacher!

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,770
Teacher.

55
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,510
Goodness! T-That is...

56
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,210
Is it not the Young Master?

57
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,870
Teacher, are you okay? Teacher.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,890
These are the days.

59
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,300
You are that lady from the video. Right?

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,210
- Yes. 
 - Gosh!

61
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,790
She must be actually dating Young Master.

62
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,230
What a handsome couple they are.

63
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,510
If so, when are you two getting married?

64
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,470
- Pardon? 
 - Gosh, don't be silly.

65
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,180
He will let us know when the time comes.

66
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,040
Right, Young Master?

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,180
Do not delay it since you will get married, anyway.

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,910
Master must want many offspring since you are his only grandson.

69
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,170
 Marriage? Offspring? 

70
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,290
 Let me catch you, Ha Ram and Ha Reum. 

71
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,930
 All right. Come on. 

72
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,660
 Goodness, goodness, goodness. 

73
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,170
 You are so good at running away. 

74
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,040
Well, if Young Master inherits the village,

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,690
you will become the madam of the Woorim family.

76
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,290
Do not forget the friendship we formed today.

77
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,760
I gave it a cold press. You will feel better soon.

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Okay. Thank you.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,870
Thank you so much for your help.

80
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,200
Gosh, it is nothing.

81
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,920
By the way, the shikhye got warm.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,940
That is better since it is cold today.

83
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,570
- You are right. 
 - Let us go.

84
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,200
Let us go.

85
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,730
I knew I smelled something sweet.

86
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,560
Gosh, seriously.

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,240
That is enough. Let us go.

88
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,410
   

89
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,280
I said I can walk.

90
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,020
Take it easy today, just in case.

91
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,180
 If Yoon Bok inherits the village, 

92
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,800
 what am I supposed to do? 

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,830
 My dream is to go to Paris. 

94
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,300
 If I leave to Paris, 

95
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,150
 what would happen to Yoon Bok and me? 

96
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,780
Are you worried about something?

97
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,270
Huh?

98
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,280
Well...

99
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,040
Yoon Bok, should we sit there for a moment?

100
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,020
Yes.

101
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,210
- Teacher— 
 - Yoon Bok—

102
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,170
Go ahead.

103
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,920
The thing is...

104
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,480
By chance...

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,110
what is your plan going forward?

106
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,950
- Plan? 
 - Yes.

107
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,100
I'm curious what you'll do a year, two years,

108
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,690
and three years from now on.

109
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,130
I wonder.

110
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,590
I am not sure what I will be doing.

111
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,040
But I will be by your side no matter what I do.

112
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,660
Even if it might be on the other side of the planet.

113
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,380
Really?

114
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,040
A scholar needs to be faithful to his woman.

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,020
The moment I gave you my heart, I gave you my time, too.

116
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,510
It would be my duty to follow you anywhere.

117
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,900
Yoon Bok.

118
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,510
   

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,930
 The keychain Joon Ho had... 

120
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,270
 Father used to wear it before Father passed away. 

121
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,290
Why would Joon Ho...

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,420
Come out, Mr. Lee.

123
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,640
You'll be transferred to a detention center.

124
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,270
 ­  

125
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,280
May I make a phone call?

126
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,950
You can't.

127
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,910
- Just one phone call. 
 - No.

128
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,750
 ­  

129
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,330
 ­  

130
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,600
   

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,280
Lee Joon Ho!

132
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,660
   

133
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,770
Joon Ho...

134
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,070
don't you have something to say to me?

135
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,150
I have nothing to tell you, Detective.

136
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,270
 I'm sorry. 

137
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,910
Damn it!

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,050
So, you can enjoy fashion, architecture, and nature all at once,

139
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,580
put the seats over there.

140
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,070
Make the stage equipment as low profile as possible.

141
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,190
Make sure we don't damage anything.

142
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,540
Let the entire staff know.

143
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,130
It'd be fun for the models to walk here.

144
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,510
Gosh, Ms. Ca. Bonjour.

145
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,830
Bonjour. How's everything?

146
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,460
I am glad I ran into you.

147
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,160
I am on my way to taste the food for the fashion show. Come with me.

148
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,450
Come with me!

149
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,270
How about me?

150
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,270
Wait for me!

151
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,620
   

152
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,860
Senior, are you really going to Paris after the fashion show?

153
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,980
I'm jealous.

154
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,390
By the way, if you go to Paris,

155
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,010
what would happen to your boyfriend? Will you break up?

156
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,740
Yoon Bok?

157
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,590
 But I will be by your side, no matter what I do. 

158
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,130
 Even if it might be on the other side of the planet. 

159
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,790
He'll be coming with me.

160
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,660
Whoa.

161
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,930
Teacher, how is your ankle?

162
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,690
It's fine, of course.

163
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,130
I think I could fly away.

164
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,630
Be careful. You will hurt yourself.

165
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,390
Be careful.

166
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,100
Hong Do Kim, visit the Village Wives' Association with Yoon Bok.

167
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,510
Is it good?

168
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,230
Try this, too.

169
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,190
Hong Do Kim!

170
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,430
Goodness!

171
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,350
Goodness, you came, Young Master.

172
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,250
Well, is your ankle doing okay?

173
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,860
Yes, thank you for yesterday.

174
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,420
Do not mention it.

175
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,470
Come this way.

176
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,450
Hong Do Kim, I'm in trouble.

177
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,420
What is it, Ms. Camille?

178
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,780
I've been on a diet for 40 years, but it all went to waste today.

179
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,580
- Pardon? 
 - Gosh.

180
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,620
Lady Hong Do, try this.

181
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,880
- Thank you. 
 - Eat, eat.

182
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,970
- Here, try this, too. 
 - Okay.

183
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,660
Gosh, she likes it.

184
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,810
Drink this. Drink it up.

185
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,770
You will get thirsty.

186
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,220
Ms. Ca, what are you doing? Eat more.

187
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,200
I said I'm full!

188
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,230
Gosh, gosh. My goodness.

189
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,070
Look how thin your wrists are.

190
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,200
You cannot even thread a needle with wrists like this.

191
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,630
Eat more. More, more.

192
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,650
Eat, eat, eat.

193
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,800
More, more.

194
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,370
The village feels alive since Young Master is here.

195
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,500
I know. It reminds me of when Excellency Shin was alive.

196
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:45,630
Your father used to bring people in from the outside like this, too.

197
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,720
   

198
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,100
   

199
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
 We'll get going now. 

200
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,640
   

201
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,900
Seeing strangers coming by

202
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,850
made us feel nervous at first, but...

203
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,340
 Gosh, what is this? 

204
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,130
 I am not sure if it helps to preserve tradition. 

205
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,510
 Our village needs to change now, too. 

206
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,470
 The villagers' quality of life matters as much as tradition. 

207
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,840
 Your Excellency. 

208
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,270
 Thank you so much. 

209
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,610
 It was hard to go around since it gets dark in the evening these days. 

210
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,780
 Our village's future is looking bright now. 

211
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,730
 My child used to cry because he got scared at night, 

212
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,690
 but he fell asleep laughing last night. 

213
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,350
 I should have done it sooner. It took too long. 

214
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,980
 I will work hard for you to live more comfortably from now on. 

215
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,160
 Thank you. 

216
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,190
Thanks to that, the village became brighter

217
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,820
and the moods lit up, too.

218
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,970
Our lives improved so much.

219
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,950
If His Excellency did not do that for us...

220
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,960
My gosh, I do not know how we would have lived.

221
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,250
You know how.

222
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,270
We would have had to hold our bladder at night and live like that.

223
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,140
He cared for us so much.

224
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,690
Heaven is so cruel.

225
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,510
You will continue his legacy going forward. Right?

226
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,190
Will you not?

227
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,640
Yes.

228
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,800
How nice.

229
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,030
Yoon Bok,

230
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,200
your father...

231
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,990
must've been a great person.

232
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,800
Everyone misses him so much.

233
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:20,120
I heard he tried to reform the village for the villagers.

234
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,110
I do not remember well since he passed when I was a child,

235
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,090
but I remember a few things he said clearly.

236
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,920
 Yoon Bok, the Seongsan Gate opens widely for the first time today. 

237
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,680
 Remember that our village was reborn today. 

238
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,760
Since he passed away,

239
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,860
Grandfather closed the village gate and paused everything,

240
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:01,060
but someone has to continue the work for the village.

241
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,730
I noticed it was broken last night.

242
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,890
Children run around here a lot around sunset.

243
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,900
Call a technician and fix it before they get injured.

244
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,370
Okay.

245
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,620
- This is awesome. It's so pretty. 
 - It photographs so well.

246
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,520
- It's so pretty. 
 - Take one of me.

247
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,280
Okay, how about like this? One, two, three.

248
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,050
Aren't Camille and Frankie kind of suspicious?

249
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,890
Huh? What do you mean?

250
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,950
They're always glued to each other.

251
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,370
- Right. That's what I'm saying. 
 - Right?

252
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,700
At first, I thought they were married.

253
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,360
Right?

254
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,210
I suppose Frankie is capable, kind,

255
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,320
and he doesn't look bad for his age. Even Ms. Camille could've fallen for him.

256
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,690
Right?

257
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,040
A handsome middle-aged man who's like a brother?

258
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,850
Brother?

259
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,100
Hey...

260
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,400
Her employees are chatting away instead of working.

261
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,040
What is she doing, anyway?

262
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,270
Between this and this...

263
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,400
This is a little cuter.

264
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,850
It's Grandpa.

265
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,880
- Hello, Grandpa. 
 - Hello.

266
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,560
Grandpa, are you busy? Grandpa!

267
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,540
Take care, Grandpa.

268
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,150
I miss you, too, Honey.

269
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,840
I'll come home as soon as the fashion show ends.

270
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes.

271
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,030
I love you.

272
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,070
What is this?

273
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,670
That...

274
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,530
That man...

275
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,100
acts like her husband outside, but he is actually...

276
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,690
married to someone else?

277
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,380
Does Camille know about this?

278
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,490
What am I supposed to do about this?

279
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,440
My goodness.

280
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,650
 Are you in there? 

281
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,230
The Wives' Association made this. It's so tasty.

282
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,000
I didn't even realize I ate a whole basket in one sitting.

283
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,250
I will eat it later.

284
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,890
Don't be difficult. Just eat it!

285
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,490
I brought it because I heard you liked it.

286
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,080
Lady,

287
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,990
well...

288
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,500
may I ask you one thing?

289
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,300
That man named Frankie.

290
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,630
Frankie?

291
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,300
How much do you know about that man?

292
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,940
You could say I basically know everything.

293
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,110
You know everything?

294
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,830
About his family and people around him, too?

295
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,210
I always feel bad whenever I think of his family.

296
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,600
But what can I do? I can't do anything without him.

297
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,820
You cannot!

298
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,270
What do you mean?

299
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,650
How could you do that with a man with a family—

300
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,280
What?

301
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,150
Never mind.

302
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,100
You can leave.

303
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,230
What?

304
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,790
Hold on!

305
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,290
By chance, do you...

306
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,750
­My gosh!

307
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,980
We're just business partners and best friends.

308
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,560
Friends?

309
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,250
How could a man and woman be friends?

310
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,900
People do that outside the village.

311
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,500
You're so old-fashioned.

312
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,790
By chance, are you jealous?

313
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,490
A-Am I what? Jealous?

314
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,680
Scholars are not allowed to feel that way.

315
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,060
Forget it, then. Why are you getting so upset?

316
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,760
You're making me think you're actually jealous.

317
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,160
I said I am not!

318
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,480
Fine!

319
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,300
Give it to me!

320
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,300
Here we go again!

321
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,750
I have told you many times that you will become a village guard like me.

322
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,950
Learn martial arts instead of doing useless things like this.

323
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,420
 You're the Woorim family's eldest son who will lead this village. 

324
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
 You do not have enough time to study literature and martial arts. 

325
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,190
 How could you do something so useless? 

326
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,340
You are talented.

327
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,690
I want you to paint my face next time.

328
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,950
Really?

329
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,120
But I will get scolded by my grandfather.

330
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,260
If he does,

331
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,220
tell him that I begged you.

332
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,160
 20 years went by, but nothing has changed. 

333
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,580
Teacher!

334
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,650
Yoon Bok, over here!

335
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,770
Looks like you practiced a bit.

336
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,420
You improved a lot.

337
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,480
It is thanks to your ability.

338
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,860
Let's practice top poses today.

339
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,800
You strike a top pose before you turn at the end of the runway.

340
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,750
Let me try.

341
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,350
Okay.

342
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,950
Walk confidently...

343
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,880
look in the center, left,

344
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,080
and right.

345
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,150
And show off your back like this.

346
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,020
Can you do it?

347
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,830
Yes. There are some poses I learned on my own.

348
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,940
Oh, really?

349
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,990
Let's have a look, then.

350
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,820
Where did you pick up these poses?

351
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,960
I saw people doing this on TV.

352
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,720
Yoon Bok, you will be on stage as the face of the Seongsan Village.

353
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,180
So, you just need to show your elegant self as a scholar.

354
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,040
Is that so?

355
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,550
Yes.

356
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,890
If so, I will try again.

357
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,420
Okay.

358
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,620
Go.

359
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,170
Yes, that's it! That's it! Well done.

360
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,530
Yoon Bok, what are you thinking about?

361
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,370
What do kids outside the village dream about at that age?

362
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,460
They dream about all sorts of things.

363
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,510
Athletes, idols, police officers, teachers,

364
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,130
astronauts, and so on.

365
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,720
You want to become a lot of things at that age.

366
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,350
I want those children...

367
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,740
to also have a range of dreams like that freely.

368
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,870
 Since Father passed away, 

369
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,840
 Grandfather closed the village gate and paused everything, 

370
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:49,830
 but someone has to continue the work for the village. 

371
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,370
There is something I thought about for that reason.

372
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,600
Would you like to hear it?

373
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,320
Seongsan Cultural Academy?

374
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,750
Yes, we will invite outside teachers to the village

375
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,700
and let them learn skills from the outside world

376
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,750
that they could not have learned in Seongsan.

377
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,670
Then, the children and young adults can have a wider range of dreams.

378
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,620
But the traditions our ancestors have been protecting might disappear, then.

379
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,020
If traditions cannot keep up with the times, they will disappear anyway.

380
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,930
Accepting new things wisely...

381
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,670
must be the way to protect traditions.

382
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,800
 Old things are bound to get destroyed if you leave them as they are. 

383
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,740
 Teacher. 

384
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,420
How did it go?

385
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,810
 I do not want to repeat the pain from the past. 

386
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,560
 So... 

387
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,540
 try it just for a day as a test. 

388
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,490
 Let us think about the future after we see the result. 

389
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,150
That's so great.

390
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,030
Yes. I will have to think about what the village needs.

391
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,620
Yes.

392
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,890
Are you on the way to Ms. Ca's house?

393
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,750
Yeah, and?

394
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,280
Give it to me and rest inside.

395
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,890
I am okay.

396
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,210
Go inside. Go inside. Go, go.

397
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,460
Geez.

398
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,610
We will install a stage in front of this bell tower.

399
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,770
Whenever there has been a danger,

400
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,860
the soldiers rang that bell to protect the village.

401
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,030
It is a very meaningful site.

402
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,650
It's a good opportunity to let the world know about the cultural heritage.

403
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,680
Take extra care so it doesn't get damaged.

404
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,230
I already notified all the staff members about it.

405
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,470
Who is that man?

406
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,250
He is someone I know. Do not worry.

407
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,560
Here is the sujeonggwa. 
  (Cinnamon dessert drink with persimmons) 

408
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,330
Here.

409
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,310
Hold on.

410
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,310
This is tastier.

411
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,790
They say pine nuts are good for stress relief.

412
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,210
Chew them slowly and enjoy them.

413
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,200
Who should we invite, then?

414
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,170
Gosh!

415
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,910
What are you doing right now?

416
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,820
Well, I was just...

417
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,260
Yeojudaek asked me to deliver it. I had no choice.

418
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,320
Are you working with those impressive people, by the way?

419
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,290
You're so cool. I'm moved.

420
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,230
Don't come to my workplace again.

421
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,680
That little...

422
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,860
She's as cold as ice. Seriously.

423
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,770
What can I do? I'm a sinner.

424
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,560
I told you to rest inside.

425
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,700
Why are you sighing outside instead?

426
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,030
The thing is...

427
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:09,110
Would you be able to go there with me?

428
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,360
"There"?

429
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,980
I am curious how my son is doing.

430
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,680
I want to visit him,

431
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,880
but thinking about going there alone...

432
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,470
makes my heart race.

433
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,140
  ­ 

434
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,250
  ­  
 Your visit has been denied.

435
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:50,340
I'm sorry you're getting rejected every time, Corporal Shin.

436
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,550
I lost the count now.

437
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,990
I'll come back.

438
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,410
Okay.

439
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,130
I'll walk around the neighborhood...

440
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,910
and wait at the coffee shop over there.

441
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,250
Take your time seeing your son, and have a good chat.

442
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,260
Don't cry too much.

443
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,530
   

444
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,790
8789. You have a visitor.

445
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,080
I said I won't see that detective.

446
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,850
Tell her not to come back.

447
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,070
It's your mother this time.

448
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,820
Joon Ho.

449
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,710
Gosh, my baby. My poor baby.

450
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,220
Your face got so skinny already.

451
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,900
How did you come here, Mom?

452
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,230
What do you mean?

453
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,610
I came to see my son's face.

454
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,430
Did you come alone?

455
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,920
Did anything happen on your way over?

456
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,810
What are you talking about?

457
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,280
I'm asking if anyone followed you!

458
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,440
What is wrong with you?

459
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,880
Leave, Mom.

460
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,900
- What? 
 - Go back to the village immediately.

461
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,010
And don't come back until I get released.

462
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,000
No, don't leave the village at all until then.

463
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,320
What is wrong with you?

464
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,810
The visit is over.

465
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,360
Joon Ho! Joon Ho!

466
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Joon Ho!

467
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,270
Where did he go?

468
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,220
Gosh.

469
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,350
I ended up being late.

470
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,580
Hold on.

471
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,370
Why do you have a scar on your face?

472
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,920
I fell on the way.

473
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,840
Geez! What are you, a kid? Be careful.

474
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,280
How about you? Your eyes are all puffy.

475
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,440
I told you not to cry.

476
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,960
I didn't cry.

477
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,810
I only cried a bit.

478
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,060
   

479
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,810
   

480
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,430
How about we ask Hong Hak to teach a webtoon class?

481
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,480
Hong Hak?

482
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,140
Grandfather worries about safety more than anything.

483
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,830
It would be good to ask someone we can trust.

484
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,980
Okay. I'll tell him to do it, no matter what.

485
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,830
Thank you.

486
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,680
Oh, right.

487
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,260
Should we ask Hyang Gi, too?

488
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,770
A lot of people get trained to become baristas, too.

489
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,940
That is a good idea.

490
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,250
If so, you should join us, too.

491
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,890
Me?

492
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,510
If you joined us,

493
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:54,080
the villagers would understand and relate to you more.

494
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,390
Shall I, then?

495
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,570
Yes.

496
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,050
Sounds good.

497
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,540
We will ask Hong Hak to take this...

498
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,560
That's a great idea.

499
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,830
I was wondering how to return the favor to them

500
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,860
for opening up to us.

501
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,840
This is great. Go ahead and volunteer.

502
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,430
Okay.

503
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,790
Hello?

504
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,800
What? Teach them about webtoons?

505
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,240
At Seongsan Village?

506
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,250
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

507
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,400
It's for good purpose, you know.

508
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,820
I'm not sure. I don't know if I have time.

509
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,890
Sis, I'm busy. I'm a popular webtoon artist.

510
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,920
I can't drive long distances. It's too exhausting.

511
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,400
How am I supposed to get all the way there?

512
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,150
Will you buy me a car?

513
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,030
Whatever!

514
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,310
I beg you.

515
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,980
Please.

516
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,970
You want me to teach children about self-defense?

517
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,440
I would like you to do it.

518
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,080
Okay, I will prepare for it.

519
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,820
   

520
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,000
   

521
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,880
   

522
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,090
It is finally tomorrow.

523
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,530
I hope it goes well.

524
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,350
   

525
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,420
What's this now?

526
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,930
What's this?

527
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,890
   

528
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,840
Seongsan Cultural Academy.

529
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,070
    
 What?

530
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,220
Is Hong Hak coming to the village?

531
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:38,430
"Webtoon drawing. Kim Hong Hak."  Yes, it's him.

532
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,390
It's him.

533
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,980
I will be back.

534
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,500
Welcome.

535
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,450
- You came. 
 - Long time no see.

536
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,240
I can't believe I made it to Seongsan Village.

537
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,480
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

538
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,360
You must be busy, too.

539
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,080
Thank you so much for coming.

540
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,880
Come on. Friends should help each other out.

541
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,330
Shall we go in, then?

542
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,740
Let us go.

543
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,260
Why is it so quiet?

544
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,190
Don't say no one signed up for the classes.

545
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,220
Are you all here for the Cultural Academy?

546
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,920
 Yes! 

547
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,210
If so, let us get started.

548
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,100
Hey, lady!

549
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,160
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

550
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,300
Do not be so dramatic.

551
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,400
   

552
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,820
♫  ...but it's already here  ♫

553
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,940
♫  You smiled at me brighter than sunshine  ♫

554
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,480
♫  I want you. I need you  ♫

555
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,210
    
 Look inside the box.

556
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,000
- Wow! 
 - Cool!

557
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,010
- Isn't it fascinating? 
  - Yes. 

558
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,490
If you push this button here...

559
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,610
 Wow! 

560
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,590
Would you like to draw yourselves now?

561
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,960
 Yes! 

562
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,670
Okay, start!

563
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,750
 Start! 

564
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,820
- One! 
  - One! 

565
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,750
- Spin, and two! 
  - Two! 

566
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,260
- Spin again, and bam! 
 - Bam!

567
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,760
With more energy. Bam!

568
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,050
 Bam! 

569
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,400
And, one, two!

570
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,120
Here's a heart shape...

571
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,330
♫  For me, if it's you  ♫

572
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,200
How is that a heart shape?

573
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,780
♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

574
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,880
To be honest, I'm better at

575
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,650
creating a heart shape this way.

576
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,390
Who wants relationship advice?

577
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:22,300
♫  I've been hiding my heart for a long time  ♫

578
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:26,280
Make the round-nose rounder.

579
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,300
And make the dark eyebrows darker.

580
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,850
If you draw daringly like that...

581
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,170
- Ta-da. 
 - Wow.

582
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,130
He is not so bad when he works.

583
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,290
I know.

584
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,350
What are you doing here?

585
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:54,670
♫  In my world, it's you who shines brightly  ♫

586
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:01,190
Protecting what is old is as important as learning new things.

587
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:06,850
I think our most beautiful tradition is insa. 
  (Means greeting or etiquette) 

588
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,480
But there is a rule of insa that's the most difficult to follow.

589
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,860
It is one in which you admit your wrongdoing.

590
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,890
It is called "apologizing."

591
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,390
Come on, you have to apologize if you bumped into someone.

592
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,120
I do not want to.

593
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,690
What a rude person you are.

594
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,240
Let go of me!

595
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,560
Kapow!

596
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,810
This is no good. Impolite person.

597
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,050
Face the sword of justice!

598
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,290
No!

599
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,620
No!

600
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,100
Only if I apologized...

601
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,940
What do you think?

602
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,230
You have to apologize if you did something bad. Right?

603
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,690
 Yes! 

604
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,510
Insa literally means "A person's duty."

605
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:34,520
I hope you become someone who says a word of insa first.

606
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,580
 Okay. 

607
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,660
   

608
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,120
Good job, Yoon Bok.

609
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,570
The kids really loved it.

610
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:06,010
It is thanks to you and the rest's impressive acting.

611
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,660
I hope I was even a little bit helpful to the children.

612
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,130
They must have felt how much...

613
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,950
you care for the village.

614
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,910
I should think about what else I can do for the village.

615
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,860
Yoon Bok!

616
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,860
What is going on, exactly?

617
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,710
Hurry, hurry.

618
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,580
  ­ 

619
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,840
We all wrote you letters together.

620
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,500
   

621
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,250
   

622
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,460
   

623
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,020
   

624
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,140
   

625
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,120
   

626
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,280
   

627
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,300
   

628
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,040
Yoon Bok.

629
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,780
   

630
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,840
   

631
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,970
Do I look like this?

632
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,290
Do you not like it?

633
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,370
I do.

634
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,430
I just love it so much.

635
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,800
Thank you so much for everything today.

636
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,550
Let me know if you plan something like this again.

637
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:29,320
I think I fell in love with Seongsan Village.

638
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,920
We will.

639
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,470
I will take the two of you back.

640
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,020
You and Teacher can go back now.

641
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,670
- I will leave them in your care. 
 - Yes.

642
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,300
Travel safely.

643
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,370
Thank you, Senior. See you in Seoul.

644
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,040
Get home safely.

645
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,960
- See you at home. 
 - Okay.

646
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,820
Come this way.

647
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,470
Let us go now, too.

648
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,100
I'll stop by the restroom.

649
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh, right. Someone was waiting for you earlier.

650
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,950
- Me? 
 - Yes.

651
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,320
Do I have a fan in this village, too?

652
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,080
Dad?

653
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,280
Dad?

654
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,550
- Son. 
 - Dad!

655
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,750
Son!

656
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,200
Dad!

657
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,440
How have you been?

658
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,820
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

659
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,570
I've been reading your webtoon, though.

660
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,910
- Isn't it fun? 
 - Yes.

661
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,970
Why did you age so much, Dad?

662
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,540
I went through a lot.

663
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,640
I will let you rest, Teacher.

664
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,930
Okay. You did great today.

665
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,250
Good night.

666
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,170
   

667
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,770
   

668
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,130
 I am so glad we have you in the village. 

669
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:22,130
 Please do a lot of great things like you did today. 

670
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,960
 You will continue his work from now on. Right? 

671
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,760
 I should think about what else I can do for the village. 

672
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,440
   

673
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:49,150
   

674
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,610
 I will be by your side, no matter what I do. 

675
00:53:55,610 --> 00:54:00,140
 Even if it might be on the other side of the planet. 

676
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,510
   

677
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,500
 Young Master. 

678
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,340
What is it?

679
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:30,840
Young Master, I actually met with Joon Ho yesterday.

680
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,960
And...

681
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,740
 Go tell Young Master Yoon Bok... 

682
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,720
 that I will meet with him just once. 

683
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,410
Joon Ho said he would meet with you just once.

684
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,500
Why did he say such a thing?

685
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,320
 The key chain you had in your possession. 

686
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,900
 My father had been wearing that until he passed away. 

687
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,970
 By chance, if you— 

688
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,430
 I know nothing about it. 

689
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,400
Does he have something to tell me?

690
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,720
 Teacher, did you sleep well last night? 

691
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,880
 I will be away from the village today due to an urgent matter. 

692
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,750
 I am planning to return in the evening. 

693
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:50,070
 Let us practice walking then. 

694
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,020
I wonder what's going on.

695
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,690
8789, you have a visitor.

696
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,930
Who is it?

697
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,210
His name is Shin Yoon Bok.

698
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,770
What is taking him so long?

699
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,560
Two stab wounds to the stomach.

700
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,670
BP is 70/40. It's dropping rapidly due to heavy blood loss and...

701
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,500
the organs might become damaged.

702
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,720
- Contact the surgery department. 
 - Okay.

703
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,700
   

704
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,020
Sister.

705
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,680
Yoon Bok.

706
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,740
What happened?

707
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,200
   

708
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,690
   

709
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,330
Yes, Senior. Did you find the suspect?

710
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,590
   

711
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,560
One, two, three, four, five,

712
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,510
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

713
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:33,530


714
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,650
- 200 joule. 
 - Ready.

715
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,190
Shock!

716
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,230
   

717
00:59:52,300 --> 01:00:00,110
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

718
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:03,820
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

719
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,240
♫  Where are you?  ♫

720
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,280
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

721
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,230
   

722
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,420
 The man you are trying to catch is very dangerous and cruel. 

723
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,400
 You might get hurt, Yoon Bok. 

724
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,100
 While I worry about you and the village falling in danger because of him, 

725
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,410
 I cannot leave the village. 

726
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,590
 - I can take care of that myself. 
 - Grandfather. 

727
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:35,210
 Yoon Bok, thank you so much for always treating me with care. 

728
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,980
 You should stay here. 

729
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:42,710
 Hong Do, I will do anything for you. 

730
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,430
 Who are you? 

731
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:45,750
 What are you doing here? 

732
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,490
 The key chain... Are you that man? 

733
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,350
 Teacher... 

734
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:59,320
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫
