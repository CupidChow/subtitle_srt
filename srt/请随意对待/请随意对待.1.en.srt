Looks like you do not remember me.

754

I'm sorry.

Gosh, of course.

763

Has it been seven years?

765
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,810
[7 years ago]

766
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:16,600
<i>I ran away from home at the age of 17 for the first time in my life.</i>

767
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,440
I'm here to be educated.

768
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,820
Look at his outfit.

769
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,490
- He's actually kind of handsome.
- Legendary.

770
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,530
Wow, look at him. What is he, an aristocrat?

771
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,890
<i>I thought my life in Seoul would be different,</i>

772
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:39,190
<i>but it wasn't so easy.</i>

773
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,510
The kid from the Seongsan Village. Isn't he kind of weird?

774
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:48,470
- Why would he wear the gat* with the school uniform?
- I know.
(Traditional hat for men)

775
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,890
It got in the way during a class, so I told him to take it off.

776
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,100
And he said, "This is my last duty as a scholar."

777
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,920
I completely lost it.

778
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,920
Gosh, young master!

779
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,300
What brings you to this humble place?

780
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,800
This bag... Should I call it a bojjim?

781
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,580
Let me carry that for you.

782
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,190
I deserve to die, young master!

783
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,550
Cut his head off immediately!

784
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:23,260
<i>I was nothing but a laughing stock for being different</i>

785
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,650
<i>and it made me feel small.</i>

786
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,150
<i>That was when this one person showed up.</i>

787
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,610

<i>She was the first teacher who approached me without any prejudice.</i>

793
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,560
<i>It was Ms. Kim Hong Do.</i>

794
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,000
Young Master, we were told to draw a family member.

795
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,710
Why draw a 1,000-won bill?

796
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:16,650
Is this old man your family, by chance?

797
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,920
How cool.

798
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,860
Your grandfather looks very distinguished.

799
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:30,370
Yoon Bok, you don't have to be embarrassed for being different.

800

Whether people like it or not,

801
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,520

Let me see.

804
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,510
You did a great job.

805
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,550
Yes, it has been a long time.

806
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,140
But what brings you here, Yoon Bok?

807
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:55,010
I asked a friend, and he said you would be here.

808
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:00,420
And I wanted to give you these flowers.

809
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,100
It is my gratitude as your student. Please take it.

810
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,670
Gosh, seriously.

811
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,850
I quit the academy so long ago.

812
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,060
I should have given you flowers every year.

813
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,110
But I am finally giving it to you now. I apologize.

814
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,960
Thank you.

815
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,920
Not at all. It is my duty as your student.

816
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,460
Thank you so much.

817
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,060
It's been so long since I was gifted flowers.

818
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,080
Oh, my. Silly me.

819

821
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,980
Are you okay?

822
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,610
Take it off.

823
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,140
Take it off!

824
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,420
Take it off!

825
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,700
Teacher, you cannot do this.

826
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,230
Take it off, I said.

827
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,160
Was it you?

828
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,432

Please calm down.

832
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,160
This is a tricky situation.

833
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,330
What can I do to stop your tears?

834
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,600
Tell me anything.

835
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,420

836
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,120
I don't know.

837
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:59,490
Buy me flowers or something.

838
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,210
Flowers?

839
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:11,519

<i>What are you doing there, Yoon Bok?</i>

841

<i>Why is the teacher avoiding me like that?</i>

842
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:20,009
<i>I saw suspicious people entering the VIP room.</i>

843

<i>What? Take you where?</i>

844
01:03:21,889 --> 01:03:24,959
<i>Why is the path of becoming a Jookdori so difficult?</i>

845

<i>Sunbaenim, did you design this yourself, by chance?</i>

846

<i>Are you asking me if I copied your design?</i>

847
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:32,549
<i>- Just quit your job.
- You quit if you feel uncomfortable at work.</i>

848
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:34,689
