1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
   

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:09,000
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,740
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,930
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,180
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,800
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,370
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,840
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,680
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,520
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,240
   

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,450
   

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,450
Hey, I told you to text.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,230
What? Who came by?

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,940
 That bastard is searching this whole place to catch us. 

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,510
Hey, you'd better stay put and hide in there. Got it?

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:18,320


18
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,790
 Damn it! 

19
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm sorry. I was browsing and...

20
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,140
Let me do it.

21
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,090
If it's expensive—

22
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,630
No, it's okay.

23
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,240
I'll look through the document and contact you.

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,200
You can leave now.

25
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,710
Okay.

26
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,850
Take care.

27
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,950
   

29
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,700
Ms. Kim!

30
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,480
   

31
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,600
- I confirmed. 
 - We'll head over to Seongsan Hall, then.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
Okay.

33
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,170
- Let us go. 
 - Okay.

34
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,790
Gosh, I almost missed you.

35
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,570
It's getting late. Let me drive you back.

36
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,120
- It's okay. 
 - Come on.

37
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Refusing too much isn't polite, either.

38
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,850
I'm worried.

39
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,540
Shall we?

40
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,990
Thank you for driving me home.

41
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,150
Ms. Kim.

42
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,660
Yes.

43
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,370
By chance...

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,860
did you see it?

45
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,990
Pardon?

46
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,450
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,030
I didn't mean to see it, but...

48
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,220
I saw the limited-edition Camille piece I've never seen before.

49
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,930
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,980
If so, did you go behind the closet, too?

51
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,100
The thing is... 
    

52
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,330
Excuse me.

53
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
Hey, Yoon Bok.

54
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,730
Me?

55
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,990
 I stopped by Seongsan Hall, and I'm on my way home. 

56
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,150
Mr. Lee is driving me home.

57
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,910
Okay.

58
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,850
I'm sorry, but could you drop me off here?

59
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,460
Yoon Bok said he was nearby.

60
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you for driving me.

61
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,280
Ms. Kim.

62
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,020
See you again.

63
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,360
Yoon Ah.

64
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,460
What?

65
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,670
You crazy bastard!

66
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,770
Sister.

67
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,460
There isn't much evidence here.

68
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,810
How is Teacher?

69
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:16,020
Young Master, Ms. Kim said she saw something at his place.

70
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,660
What's all this?

71
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,210
This bastard is something else.

72
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,600
Is everything okay?

73
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,170
Yes.

74
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,950
How is Teacher?

75
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,340
She seems a bit shocked, but she is okay.

76
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,710
We need to find a way to catch Lee Joon Ho.

77
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,520
Hurry up and find out where he might go.

78
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,010
Okay.

79
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,240
Yoon Bok.

80
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,200
- Teacher. 
 - Are you okay?

81
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,910
Yes, I am okay.

82
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,670
I didn't know Mr. Lee was like that.

83
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,740
I am glad nothing happened.

84
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,010
By the way, where is Hong Hak?

85
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,920
Hong Hak?

86
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,540
He said he couldn't come home due to a webtoon meeting.

87
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,770
Pardon?

88
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,760
You mean you are here by yourself?

89
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,680
Yes.

90
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,670
This is no good. I think I should stay by your side.

91
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,810
- What? 
 - If you let me,

92
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,740
I will stay here tonight.

93
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,240
You're sleeping here?

94
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,990
Oh, yes.

95
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,470
Of course...

96
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,620
I'll allow it.

97
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,630
Willingly...

98
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,680
Relax, then.

99
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,300
Relax.

100
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,830
Okay. Have a relaxing time, Teacher.

101
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay.

102
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,690
Gosh, were you awake?

103
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,710
How come you are not sleeping, Teacher?

104
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,750
Well, I couldn't sleep.

105
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,560
You cannot sleep?

106
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,600
No.

107
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,640
If so,

108
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,740
have a seat here.

109
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,680
- Should I? 
 - Yes.

110
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:40,240
I will tell you a story until you get sleepy.

111
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,190
Story?

112
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:49,330
It is a story from the book I used to read whenever I could not sleep.

113
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,670
Confucius' disciple, Zai Yu once said...

114
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,800
"Fortune comes from frugal places,

115
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,950
virtue comes from humility,

116
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,350
principle comes from ease,

117
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,940
and life comes from brightness."

118
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,290
What a nice saying.

119
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,530
"Do not refuse what comes naturally,

120
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,360
do not chase what is in the past,

121
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,730
do not anticipate what is yet to come,

122
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,240
and do not dwell on what is in the past."

123
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,180
"Only protect what is right...

124
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,540
and do not fool your heart.

125
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,400
Beware and...

126
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,830
beware again."

127
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,070
I'm home.

128
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,020
Sis...

129
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,370
I had a crazy nightmare just now.

130
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,720
You and my friend Yoon Bok—

131
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,770
Watch what you say.

132
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,540
What?

133
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,670
We're...

134
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,510
dating.

135
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,970
I need a place to stay.

136
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,620
What? CEO Lee Joon Ho?

137
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,140
Is he the one who hurt you last time, too?

138
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,130
I didn't think he'd be like that.

139
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,950
For that reason...

140
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,450
we should hire someone else to do the catering.

141
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,990
Is there a place you have in mind?

142
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,620
How about we ask the people of Seongsan Village?

143
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,800
To highlight the fact that we are collaborating with Seongsan Village.

144
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,280
That sounds great.

145
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,690
Why don't you make it happen, Hong Do Kim?

146
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,400
Okay.

147
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,360
Young Master, I found the car.

148
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,700
 Hey! Are you kidding me? 

149
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
What should we do now?

150
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,930
We should wait for fish since we threw a net.

151
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,780
I will meet Yeojudaek tomorrow, just in case.

152
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,880
My gosh!

153
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,230
You scared the hell out of me.

154
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,430
I will take this.

155
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,600
This goes to Master's room, right?

156
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,440
Are you trying to get caught?

157
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,320
- Give that to me. 
 - Come on.

158
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Don't worry about a thing.

159
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,430
I'll drop it off instantly like a wind.

160
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,020
Shoo!

161
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,590
Shoo!

162
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,700
Goodness, seriously...

163
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,300
There.

164
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,680
Gosh, there are a lot of treasures here.

165
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,600
There's a rock, too.

166
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,480
Wow, there's a bonsai, too.

167
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,240
The thief made his way into my bedroom.

168
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,310
He must be someone around me.

169
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,310
Who would do such a thing?

170
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,480
What is this?

171
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,490
Who are you?

172
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 I am considering supporting you to become 

173
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,300
 the Seongsan Village's leader. 

174
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,120
If it was not for Se Ryeong and Yoon Bok's marriage...

175
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,200
My neck...

176
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,160
Tell the truth.

177
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,060
Who are you?

178
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,480
Me?

179
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,870
I'm Kim Chil Bok.

180
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,240
Do you work for Gamjjok?

181
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
No, no.

182
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,450
The young master of this family told me to hide here.

183
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,280
Yoon Bok did?

184
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,780
It's because I...

185
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,140
saw something I shouldn't have seen.

186
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,150
Since I might get killed,

187
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:38,500
the young master hid me here as some sort of a h-hidden card, I guess?

188
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,440
Do you expect me to believe you?

189
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,750
 What he said is true. 

190
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,070
Young Master.

191
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,420
This is the key chain attached to the village storage key.

192
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:01,380
That man from earlier saw Gamjjok with this key.

193
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,990
This is your father's belonging. How—

194
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,340
We could find out once we catch Gamjjok.

195
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,190
I thought he was already caught.

196
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,630
Grandfather, to be honest,

197
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,950
the real Gamjjok is someone else.

198
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,660
What did you say?

199
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,610
I told you to be careful.

200
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,910
Eat slowly. You might get an upset stomach.

201
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,050
- Water. 
 - No.

202
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,770
- D-Dongchimi. Give me dongchimi. 
 - Geez.

203
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,670
- Dongchimi! 
 - Hold on.

204
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,120
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

205
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,640
Young Master.

206
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,560
Gosh! Young Master, why do you look thinner every time I see you?

207
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,330
Are you eating well?

208
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,710
Do not worry about me. You make sure to eat well.

209
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,880
I cannot eat more than I already do.

210
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,630
Is everything okay with you?

211
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,510
Not much is going on with me.

212
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,010
Is Joon Ho doing well?

213
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,290
I would not know.

214
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,430
He has never been one to show affection and stay in touch.

215
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,650
Teacher!

216
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,200
Gosh, Yoon Bok.

217
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,580
What brings you here?

218
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,400
I came to see your grandfather regarding the fashion show.

219
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,500
If so, let us go back together.

220
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,820
I will wait until you are done.

221
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,070
Really?

222
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,380
Should we get something tasty on the way back?

223
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,980
Yes, let us.

224
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,620
Hello.

225
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,500
   

226
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,780
Let me discuss it with the villagers.

227
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,360
Thank you in advance.

228
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,320
Your name is...

229
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,360
Kim Hong Do, did you say?

230
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,240
Yes.

231
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,530
I heard you have been very helpful to my grandson.

232
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,220
Thank you.

233
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,480
Please don't mention it.

234
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,050
Yoon Bok has been helping me more.

235
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,420
I do not know how this might sound,

236
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,450
but Yoon Bok will come back to the village.

237
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,730
The deeper the feelings, the more you will get hurt.

238
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:19,600
So, sharing feelings just enough to manage would be good for both of you. Would they not?

239
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,110
I understand what you mean.

240
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,840
But...

241
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,840
I hope you let Yoon Bok decide that.

242
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,400
No matter what he decides, I want to honor it

243
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,330
as long as he's happy.

244
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,860
Did I make a mistake?

245
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,140
No, right?

246
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,880
I did the right thing for Yoon Bok.

247
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,690
Yes, good job. Good job.

248
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,400
Or not?

249
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,720
I don't know.

250
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,270
Did the conversation go well?

251
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,200
Yes, of course.

252
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,080
What should we eat?

253
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,200
I would like anything you crave.

254
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,130
Really? How about...

255
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,790
so-tteok-so-tteok at a rest stop? 
  (Sausages and rice cake on a stick) 

256
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,660
You've been to a rest stop. Right?

257
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,480
Yes, I think I have seen one passing by.

258
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,820
Really? Did you try anything?

259
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,970
 I want to protect her even if it means giving up everything. 

260
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,910
 No matter what he decides, I want to honor it 

261
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,440
 as long as he's happy. 

262
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
   

263
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,250
   

264
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,130
   

265
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,960
   

266
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,890
   

267
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,190
What did you just say?

268
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,030
You will withdraw the wedding proposal? What nonsense is this?

269
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,470
I rushed things without knowing how determined Yoon Bok was.

270
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,700
- I am sorry. 
 - Sir!

271
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,390
Let us take time to reconsider the marriage.

272
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,550
 I will not just sit and take it. 

273
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,140
 I did not expect to hear from you. 

274
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,170
Yes, let me hear what you have to say.

275
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,640
It will help you greatly to get what you want.

276
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,590
Hong Do Kim?

277
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,390
Yes.

278
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,370
I got a call from Seongsan Village.

279
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,240
They agreed to do the catering.

280
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,150
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

281
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,020
Let's see what you have here.

282
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,880
Okay.

283
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,330
- Let's switch the lining to silk. 
 - Okay.

284
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,090
- The texture only you can feel gives satisfaction. 
 - Okay.

285
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,800
I think it'd be perfect if you changed just that.

286
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,390
Thank you.

287
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,110
Here.

288
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,570
I'll let you get back to it.

289
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,410
Thank you.

290
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,850
Let's go, guys. Coffee is on me today.

291
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,070
- Really? 
 - Yes.

292
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,080
Yay! You're the best, Senior.

293
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,230
I can't drink coffee.

294
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,410
You can order something else. What would you like?

295
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,440
Caffeine doesn't let me sleep at night.

296
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,200
I'll have a caramel java chip shake with extra caramel, whipped cream,

297
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,100
ice, cinnamon, chocolate chips, and java chips.

298
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,720
Okay.

299
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,580
Let's go.

300
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,970
Hong Do Kim, this is...

301
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,380
Why aren't you working?

302
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,070
Will you let the models go on stage

303
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,310
wearing only undergarments at the fashion show?

304
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,860
We'll take a quick coffee break and come back.

305
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,620
Coffee?

306
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,370
Should I join you, too?

307
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,960
Pardon?

308
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,690
I'll pay.

309
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,180
Really?

310
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,900
I'll get you cakes, too.

311
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,700
- You can have two glasses. 
 - Really?

312
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,930
Let's go, let's go. Yes, yes. Let's go.

313
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,420
Coffee. Let's go!

314
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,120
 Where are you? 

315
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,360
   

316
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,900
 Come to the second floor. 

317
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,800
 You'll get a lesser sentence if you work with us. 

318
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,790
What happened?

319
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,640
Go check upstairs.

320
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,360
Okay.

321
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,750
He could not have gone far.

322
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,130
He must be nearby.

323
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,490
Officer Lee, block the entrance and check the back.

324
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,050
Detective Kim, join them. Detective Jang will come with me.

325
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,830
- Let's get moving! 
 - Yes!

326
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,350
What brings you here at this hour?

327
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,560
Pichohye is a part of the tradition

328
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,150
Seongsan's artisans have been protecting for a long time.

329
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,810
How dare you make it look French?

330
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,490
You deceived the villagers and sold out our tradition!

331
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,080
What kind of nonsense is this?

332
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,990
The whole world discovered our almost forgotten tradition.

333
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,310
We should be glad about that.

334
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:49,590
The entire profit from the pichohye sales was donated for the return of cultural heritage.

335
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,460
If so...

336
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,660
what is this?

337
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,020
You are trying to make a profit

338
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,320
by scheming with this woman!

339
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,340
The fashion show is not going to happen.

340
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,140
If this turns out to be true,

341
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,860
you will have to step down as the village leader.

342
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,470
Your Excellency Lee!

343
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,930
Your Excellency Lee!

344
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,340
My goodness! Master!

345
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,090
Goodness!

346
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,210
Master! Goodness...

347
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,490
What is going on?

348
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,340
What? Grandfather is...

349
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,050
Young Master.

350
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,210
What happened?

351
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,000
You have no idea.

352
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The village elders came and had a huge argument.

353
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,160
I will stay with Grandfather.

354
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,620
You can go and rest.

355
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,330
Okay.

356
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,840
What? They canceled the fashion show?

357
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,880
For some reason, the village committee called first thing in the morning.

358
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,720
Let's go.

359
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,830
What?

360
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,880
Let's go and find out what's going on for ourselves!

361
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,530
Stay in bed longer.

362
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,580
I am okay.

363
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,710
It is nothing.

364
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,390
Yeojudaek contacted you for no reason.

365
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,360
It looks like they got the wrong idea after seeing that.

366
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,130
Wrong idea? What wrong idea?

367
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,990
What's going on? Why are you canceling the fashion show?

368
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,910
Well, it's all true. 
    

369
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,050
Step outside for a moment.

370
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,650
Was the fashion show canceled?

371
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,380
Yes.

372
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,230
I am sorry.

373
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,340
I am to blame for everything.

374
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,700
Who exactly...

375
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,920
Why are they bringing up the past and causing this ruckus?

376
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,670
I will try to fix it. Please give me some time.

377
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,450
The village would have been in trouble if it was not for you, Your Excellency Lee.

378
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,660
I know.

379
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,860
It turns out you were the true leader of Seongsan.

380
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,160
It is all thanks to you.

381
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,360
 Are you in there? 

382
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,340
Come in.

383
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,040
What brings you here?

384
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,310
 Why are you taking things so far? 

385
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,060
Of course, it is for the sake of the village.

386
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,310
The village?

387
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,540
Not because I withdrew the wedding proposal?

388
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,340
 The people have already turned against you. 

389
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,650
It might look better if you stepped down yourself

390
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,920
since it has come to this.

391
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,180
I am not interested in doing so at all.

392
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,850
I will make sure to reveal the truth

393
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,050
 and turn everything back. 

394
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:16,970
 Is this happening because of my marriage? 

395
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,420
Are you in there?

396
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,710
Maiden Se Ryeong.

397
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,310
Please...

398
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,060
Please talk to me for a moment.

399
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,690
I should have told you this a long time ago.

400
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,990
It took too long.

401
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:48,160
I am aware of your feelings, but unfortunately...

402
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,090
I cannot reciprocate.

403
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,730
How could you be so cruel?

404
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,780
I understand how sad and angry you are,

405
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,890
but you should move on before we hurt each other more.

406
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,670
What am I supposed to do, then?

407
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,790
I am to blame for everything.

408
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,710
Do not worry about what others think...

409
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,850
and blame me for everything.

410
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,260
I sincerely...

411
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,590
hope you meet a good person who understands your gentle heart...

412
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,440
and be happy.

413
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,670
A famous doctor in Mt. Jiri gathered this ginseng extract drop by drop.

414
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,190
Drink every drop of it.

415
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,060
Thank you.

416
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,910
 I will keep my memory with you here 

417
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,600
 and forget it as if it never happened. 

418
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,200
 So... 

419
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,980
 please forget me and live well. 

420
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,830
I think this happened to you because I sent you the key.

421
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,390
I'm sorry.

422
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,450
Don't think that.

423
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,970
Although things turned out this way,

424
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,080
I was happy to see you again.

425
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,940
Happy, my foot.

426
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,850
Whenever I thought of you,

427
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,950
I remembered the day we broke up, giving you this colored pencil.

428
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,570
It made me feel bad.

429
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,470
I know that you had no choice

430
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,720
but to make that decision then.

431
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,390
I would've made that decision, too.

432
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,250
So, don't dwell on it anymore.

433
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,120
Where did Yoon Bok go?

434
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,650
There you are.

435
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,290
Teacher, what brings you here?

436
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,080
I couldn't sleep.

437
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,290
I was looking for you, wondering what you were doing.

438
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,430
How is your grandfather? Is he okay?

439
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,750
How is Ms. Camille?

440
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,320
Don't worry so much.

441
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,380
Everything will be okay.

442
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,860
You do not have to worry, either.

443
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,650
I will make sure to fix this.

444
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,130
I'll take care of things in Seoul.

445
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,580
I'll join you as soon as things get sorted out here.

446
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,260
Safe travels.

447
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,300
My gosh, Excellency Lee is so thoughtful.

448
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,020
- He is the only one who thinks of us. 
 - Yes.

449
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,390
 Seriously. 

450
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,570
Thank you, sir.

451
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,290
Thank you, Your Excellency Lee.

452
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,670
- Here you go. 
 - This is such precious stuff.

453
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,710
The Lee family's soybean paste

454
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,490
is popular due to the reputation of Seongsan Village.

455
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,330
I have to share the profits with the villagers.

456
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,470
Thank you.

457
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,610
Okay, take as much as you would like!

458
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,740
Thank you.

459
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,550
 Thank you. Thank you. 

460
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,590
 Thank you, Your Excellency Lee. 

461
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:46,240
 Are you suggesting we work together? 

462
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,200
Why should I do that?

463
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,270
   

464
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,740
   

465
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,360
   

466
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:04,470
 I do not want to cause division at Seongsan Village. 

467
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,880
 If that is what the villagers want, 

468
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,360
 I will step down. 

469
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,730
Ms. Camille!

470
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:37,120
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Ms. Camille!

471
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,420
Ms. Camille!

472
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,180
Ms. Camille, Yoon Bok's grandfather left the village.

473
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,830
Ms. Camille, I said Grandfather left the village.

474
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,090
Say hello. He'll be helping us with the fashion show.

475
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,690
Ms. Camille, how could you do this?

476
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,630
Grandfather helped us so much.

477
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,090
Aren't you going too far?

478
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,830
Hong Do Kim,

479
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:13,460
there's nothing I can't do for work.

480
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,640
Let me do it.

481
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,940
Are you okay?

482
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,710
How nice and quiet.

483
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,000
You'll let me have the fashion show. Right?

484
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,090
I would love to help you,

485
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:12,040
but it is not up to only me to decide.

486
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,430
Let me talk to other people.

487
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,050
Here.

488
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,070
They say Heaven chooses the king, not the people.

489
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,770
Looks like you were destined to sit on top.

490
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:31,220
To be honest, I didn't think the situation would change so quickly.

491
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,790
This is all thanks to the old servant of the Woorim family—

492
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,540
I don't care. I just need to have the fashion show.

493
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,760
Anyway, I hope we work well together.

494
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,540
Here.

495
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:05,040
I should've seen that old man's shocked face in person.

496
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,500
Yes.

497
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
I found it.

498
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,820
 The door was unlocked. 

499
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,430
 Open the door. 

500
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,740
 The door has been opened. 

501
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,830
Gosh, Your Excellency Lee. Thank you so much.

502
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,210
You're helping us with the fashion show that was about to get canceled.

503
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,880
The Cultural Heritage Administration could save its face, thanks to you.

504
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,000
Gosh, do not mention it.

505
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,960
I am the leader of the village now.

506
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,320
Of course, I should help.

507
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,850
Looks like they're working hard.

508
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:01,950
Of course.

509
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:05,290
It's His Excellency Lee's appointment party. It has to be proper.

510
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,000
The reporters will be here soon.

511
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,340
The gift boxes will arrive, too.

512
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:14,990
Your Excellency Lee, the cars will be able to come in. Right?

513
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,470
I am the leader of the village. I can do that much.

514
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,270
Everything is ready to go.

515
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,740
I am not sure if this is okay.

516
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:15,720
   

517
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:45,240
Long time no see.

518
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:13,560


519
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:24,530
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

520
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,230
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

521
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,440
♫  Where are you?  ♫

522
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,810
♫  Where you used to be  ♫

523
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:38,680
   

524
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,850
 Model? 

525
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,860
 You'd be the perfect main model for my fashion show. 

526
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,080
 If Yoon Bok wants to... 

527
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,480
 Mr. Lee Joon Ho, you're under arrest for 

528
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,700
 breaching the Cultural Heritage Protection Act and theft. 

529
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,430
 There's one thing I want to ask. 

530
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:58,820
 Are you linked to my father's death seven years ago? 

531
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,590
 Who are you? 

532
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,530
 Kim Chil Bok. 

533
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,930
♫  Would I be able to see you again?  ♫
