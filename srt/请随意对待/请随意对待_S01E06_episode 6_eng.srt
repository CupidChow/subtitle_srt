1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,420
   

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,130
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,740
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,360
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,120
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,840
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,720
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,050
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,080
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,480
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,360
   

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,510
   

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,430


14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,420
 Yoon Bok! 

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,160
 This is an accident. 

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,360
 A major accident. 

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,810
 My heart wasn't ill. It just went crazy. 

18
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,270
Why does it have to be you?

19
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,090
Out of all men, why?

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,940
 Is this old man your family, by chance? 

21
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,680
 How cool. 

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,150
It was a long time ago, but he was once my student.

23
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,680
 Entering class of 2013, Design Department, fighting! 
   

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,110
 Fighting! 

25
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,740
 Drink up! 

26
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,590
    
 I'm six years older than him.

27
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,760
   

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,230
 Fill them up again. Fill them up. 

29
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,450
 Next time, why don't we... 

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,040
He's my younger brother's friend, too.

31
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,530
This is a wall I can't cross.

32
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,640
I can never cross it.

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,910
Well, there's no need to say, "never."

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,050
Since when did I care about such a thing?

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,930
Yes. They say there's no border in love. Why should I not?

36
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,770
Is it a sin for a person to love another?

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,980
Wake up, Hong Do.

38
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,530
You must be out of your mind.

39
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,270
 It's because Yoon Bok is so handsome. 

40
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,090
 My heart just fluttered for a second. 

41
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,940
These guys. It's just like how my heart flutters for them.

42
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,130
What am I, a teenage girl?

43
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,560
Don't get confused by emotions like this at the age of 30.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,680
Wake up, Hong Do!

45
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,100
 It's a minor feeling I can easily control. 

46
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,010
 It's a breeze-like emotion that will die down if I set my mind to it. 

47
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,150
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

48
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,190
 It's hopeless. 

49
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,050
♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

50
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,500
♫  I hide it and try to push it away  ♫

51
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,750
 This is a tornado-like emotion. 

52
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,310
 Its course has been set. 

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,050
 I can't... 

54
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,910
 control it. 

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,140
Just one second, Yoon Bok.

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,390
♫  For me, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

57
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:38,040
♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,080
♫  Yes, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,270
♫  It must be love  ♫

60
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,220
♫  Every day is about you  ♫

61
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,920
♫  You shine  ♫

62
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,770
Is it too obvious?

63
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,740
♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

64
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm sorry. I suddenly got a work-related call.

65
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,210
I see. Did you sleep comfortably?

66
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,080
Well, I slept very soundly.

67
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,260
How about you, Yoon Bok? Did you sleep well, too?

68
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,870
Yes. By the way, are you feeling ill?

69
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,340
What?

70
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,440
Your neck looks very uncomfortable.

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,270
Me? Well, no.

72
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,060
I'm okay.

73
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,080
Your voice changed a bit, too.

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,250
My voice? I always sound like this.

75
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,960
I am glad if you are okay.

76
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,540
The weather is so nice.

77
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,900
I should go wash my face now.

78
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,380
I can't believe I'm facing you when I just woke up.

79
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,340
Silly me.

80
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,700
Have a nice day, then.

81
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,830
   

82
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,260
That was natural.

83
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,310
I'll be out for a second.

84
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,360
Right, I became friends with Hong Do yesterday.

85
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,590
She's the same age as me, and she has a great personality.

86
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,750
Let's invite her over and eat together sometime.

87
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,690
Yes, pretend like I don't exist.

88
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,970
I still won't give up on you.

89
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,570
Mom.

90
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,820
You came early.

91
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,970
Ta-da.

92
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,450
What were you looking at so intently?

93
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,690
The tree over there.

94
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,970
The other trees are close to each other,

95
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,610
but only that one is alone. How lonely.

96
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,060
It reminds me of my Yoon Bok.

97
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,610
Mom, I met Yoon Bok.

98
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,000
He turned out really well.

99
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,400
He's so handsome because he resembles you.

100
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,490
Looks like he's doing well without feeling lonely.

101
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,460
There's someone who likes him, too.

102
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,540
That's great.

103
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,400
Why did Yoon Bok look so different today?

104
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:28,440
It feels like he became more masculine somehow.

105
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,860
Gosh, why do I keep thinking about him?

106
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,660
My heart is fluttering.

107
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,870
You're crazy. You're crazy.

108
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,640
You're out of your mind, Kim Hong Do.

109
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,350
Get it together.

110
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,290
Gosh, my head.

111
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,650
Calm down. Calm down.

112
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,250
Hong Do Kim! Come to my office now!

113
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,160
What is it?

114
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Pardon?

115
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,890
He rejected you in person?

116
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,470
He's the first person who rejected me so directly.

117
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,530
I didn't think he'd get me again.

118
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,150
There are many beautiful places in Korea.

119
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,810
Just give up on Seongsan Village.

120
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,010
I usually never take no for an answer,

121
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,710
but he's ruining things for me.

122
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,370
From now on, I'll go ahead and...

123
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,530
double down.

124
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,810
He's provoking my desire to win.

125
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,490
I'll double down, no matter what.

126
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,870
Even if I die. No matter what it takes.

127
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,030
I'll keep doubling down.

128
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,000
Hong Do Kim?

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,560
- Yes. 
 - You want to go to Paris, right?

130
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,710
- Yes! 
 - Let's...

131
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,990
have a grand fashion show in Seongsan Village and go to Paris together.

132
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,550
- Really? 
 - Yes.

133
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,570
Hong Do Kim, you shouldn't be so happy right now.

134
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,630
Why not?

135
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,750
Until Camille has a fashion show in Seongsan Village,

136
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,010
she won't go to the HQ in Paris. That's what she meant.

137
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,310
Pardon?

138
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,640
If that old man doesn't open up the village,

139
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,170
she won't be going to the HQ in Paris

140
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,770
and of course, you won't go to Paris.

141
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,310
And of course, I won't...

142
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,590
What do I do?

143
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,290
Gosh, seriously.

144
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,480
 Do I look that weak to you? 

145
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,140
 I think I can beat you in arm wrestling. 

146
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,250
 Do you want to try it? 

147
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,910
 Not arm wrestling. 

148
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,600
 I slept with a man? 

149
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,290
 With Young Master's friend, even? 

150
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,370
 I made such a serious mistake. 

151
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,070
Yoon Ah.

152
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,930
Yoon Ah.

153
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,620
Yoon Ah?

154
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,240
   

155
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,420
 The recipient has requested to block this call. 

156
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,090
   

157
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,360
Young Master.

158
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,890
You're late.

159
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,890
My apologies.

160
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,490
Did anything unusual happen last night?

161
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,010
Anything unusual?

162
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,800
No, what could possibly have happened? Nothing happened.

163
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,910
I was just asking if anything happened while I was gone to the village.

164
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,250
Why are you profusely saying no?

165
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,880
When did I say no profusely? I did not do that.

166
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,850
There you go again.

167
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,250
Why are you looking at me like that?

168
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,940
Do I look different somehow?

169
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,960
Now that you mention it, you do look a bit tired.

170
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,870
Not at all.

171
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,260
I... I am not tired at all. No.

172
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,250
That is a relief, then. Let us go.

173
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,380
We need to persuade the grandfather somehow.

174
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,940
Should I ask Yoon Bok again shamelessly?

175
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,640
What?

176
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,400
Try, you said?

177
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,430
Okay.

178
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,580
   

179
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,650
   

180
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,040
You may leave if there is something urgent.

181
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,230
Well, it is nothing. I will keep my phone off since I am getting useless calls.

182
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,700
What if Detective Park calls you urgently?

183
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,290
I do not know who it is, but it is rude to just avoid them.

184
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,440
Answer it or see them in person. Come to an agreement.

185
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

186
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,810
 Yoon Bok, are you free this evening? 

187
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,240
 Can I see you for a moment? 

188
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,490
 Yes, let us meet in the evening. 

189
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,300
I have never seen you texting someone.

190
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,750
May I ask who that was?

191
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,620
If so, would you tell me who was calling you?

192
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,170
Pardon?

193
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,330
Well, that was just a spam call. A spam.

194
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,230
They keep telling me to buy land. Seriously...

195
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,940
It was the Teacher who texted me.

196
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,060
The one who lives next door.

197
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,680
Next door?

198
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,670
If so, your friend who lives there is your teacher's—

199
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,610
younger brother.

200
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,740
Young Master!

201
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,020
Seongsan Village's goods are also very popular abroad these days.

202
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,500
People's interest in K-pop and K-contents is moving toward our tradition, too.

203
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,040
It is tremendously rewarding.

204
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,130
The goods produced by the artisans by hand are being recognized.

205
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,840
That is such great news.

206
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,340
Yes. Recently, an ignorant company abroad

207
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,010
tried to pay His Excellency Lee for his family's gochujang recipe.

208
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:30,070
My goodness. So, I said, "Go back to your country."

209
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,550
I am glad you did.

210
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:38,150
By the way, why did you wish to see me?

211
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,520
The thing is, Young Master...

212
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,810
 Sir, please open the gate just once. 

213
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,470
 I'll make sure the village doesn't suffer any damage. 

214
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,560
 What? He said no again? 

215
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,020
 Tell him, "Right back at you" immediately. 

216
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,950
 What? "Right back at you"? 

217
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,680
 Say, "Right back at you," back to her. 

218
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,080
 Right back at you, right back at you, right back at you. 

219
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,000
 I said no, did I not? 

220
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,060
 If you keep doing this, I will have to keep you out of Seongsan Village, too. 

221
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,660
 If you keep doing this, I'll use the final solution. 

222
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,400
 Tell her to do whatever she would like. 

223
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,520
 No matter what she does, I will never open the gate. 

224
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,180
You went to Seongsan Village multiple times today because of that?

225
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,950
I'm in such a difficult position.

226
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,930
That's why I wanted to see you and ask for your help.

227
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,820
Teacher.

228
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,970
Yoon Bok.

229
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,870
S-Shall we?

230
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,460
Let us.

231
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,970
A way to persuade Grandfather?

232
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,070
Yes. What does he like?

233
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,510
What would make him happy?

234
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,260
You are trying to make this work, too.

235
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,440
She must be almost as stubborn as Grandfather.

236
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,870
A fruit set? Or red ginseng?

237
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,710
Would he like that?

238
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,540
Is this that important to you?

239
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,300
Yes. It's my dream.

240
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,270
Dream?

241
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,920
I can achieve my old dream if this fashion show happens.

242
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,240
I really want to achieve it.

243
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,650
That's why I'm asking you a favor again shamelessly.

244
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,290
Are you free tomorrow, then?

245
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,690
Huh?

246
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,170
The only way to change Grandfather's mind is

247
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,950
to win over the people of the village.

248
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,870
If they want it, he will change his mind, too.

249
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,460
If so, how about tomorrow—

250
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,410
Would you go to Seongsan Village with me?

251
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,390
Yes, of course I will.

252
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,760
Should I wear this?

253
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,370
Would I look too desperate?

254
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,490
Would this be better?

255
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,240
Like this.

256
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,360
Hey! Hey! Which is better? This or this?

257
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,270
- Huh? 
 - That.

258
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,630
- This? 
 - Yes.

259
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,610
- This is better? 
 - Yes.

260
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,350
You chose this earlier!

261
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,270
- Yes, that. 
 - Geez, so annoying.

262
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,960
It hurts.

263
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,370
My body was always weak,

264
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,230
but my heart is feeling weak, too.

265
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,530
Dear God, how could you be so cruel?

266
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:56,280
Why are you giving me a bitter day after a sweet night?

267
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,490
Yoon Ah...

268
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,820
 The customer can't answer the call right now. You'll be... 

269
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,910
- Let us go. 
 - Shall we?

270
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,010
Hello.

271
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,740
Walking together like this feels like we're hanging out in the past.

272
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,640
You showed me around Seoul last time.

273
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,130
Let us say I am letting you time-travel with me today.

274
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,670
Hey, what do you mean by "travel"?

275
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,130
I'm a teacher, and you're a student.

276
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,410
People might get the wrong idea.

277
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,710
Don't be like that.

278
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,750
Wrong idea? What do you mean...

279
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,360
Huh?

280
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,600
Well, I mean...

281
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,120
People might think we're on a school trip.

282
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,970
 My Lady! 

283
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,970
Come on in.

284
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,230
What? Young Master Yoon Bok is here?

285
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,340
Sir, are you in there?

286
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,830
How pretty.

287
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,500
 Who is this? 

288
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,680
- Hello, sir. 
 - Goodness, Young Master Yoon Bok.

289
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,170
What brings you all the way here?

290
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,450
I came by to get your advice on something.

291
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,160
Hello.

292
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,250
I am sorry, but I am not interested in fashion shows.

293
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,150
I will see you later.

294
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,880
Sir.

295
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,560
Are you in there?

296
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,910
Young Master Yoon Bok.

297
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,560
Have you been well?

298
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,920
We are planning to have a fashion show in the village.

299
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,440
What? What would be the use of that?

300
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,000
I am against it.

301
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,670
Hyungnim... H-Hyungnim!

302
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,800
Pardon? Open up the village?

303
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,340
I am against it.

304
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,940
Pardon?

305
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,910
Open up the village?

306
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,840
Well, go ask someone else.

307
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,500
The fashion show would help the village economy a lot.

308
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,270
We do just fine without doing stuff like that.

309
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,320
- Ma'am, get me another soup. 
 - Ma'am...

310
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,500
- Get me more kimchi! 
 - Okay.

311
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,560
We can do it. Let's go.

312
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,410
I am okay.

313
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,130
Please, sir. Just one—

314
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,450
I said I was okay!

315
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,850
Sir! Sir, give me just a moment.

316
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,080
Please, sir!

317
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,160
I am against it!

318
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,290
I am against it.

319
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,750
I am against it.

320
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,870
It is a no for me.

321
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,200
Teacher, are you hungry at all?

322
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,100
No.

323
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,700
Are your legs tired?

324
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,600
Should we sit down a bit?

325
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,610
I'm okay.

326
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,700
Teacher, please give me some time, too.

327
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,800
What?

328
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,090
"Love for Teacher" event for the disheartened teacher.

329
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,180
It is Shin Yoon Bok's treat.

330
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,800
- Let us go. 
 - Okay.

331
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,610
Love?

332
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,890
I used to come here whenever I felt down.

333
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,410
Hold this spoon up,

334
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,880
disperse the red bean like this,

335
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,710
and if you put it in your mouth, it tastes so sweet.

336
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,540
Really? Should I try it, too?

337
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,030
I'll take a bite.

338
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,840
It's so good.

339
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,760
You told me once.

340
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,570
That "sweet-salty-sweet-salty" is mandatory.

341
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,020
Since you worked so hard today,

342
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,000
something sweet will happen tomorrow.

343
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,190
Thank you.

344
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,390
Whether it is a salty or sweet day,

345
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,830
I will always cheer you up by your side.

346
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,540
Do not be upset.

347
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,080
Okay.

348
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,860
 How could my heart not race to this? 

349
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,270
Please excuse me for a moment.

350
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,940
Hello.

351
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,180
Oh, hello.

352
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,640
Did you come here with Yoon Bok again, by chance?

353
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,700
Yes.

354
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,710
If so,

355
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,900
did you eat this alone with him?

356
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,610
Yes.

357
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,890
I will introduce myself formerly since you are his teacher.

358
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:39,950
I am Lee Se Ryeong, and I am engaged to Yoon Bok.

359
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I see. I'm Kim Hong Do.

360
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,120
But Yoon Bok said otherwise.

361
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,780
- Pardon? 
 - Yoon Bok...

362
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,420
said he'd manage his marriage himself.

363
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,500
There is no way.

364
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,090
Lady Se Ryeong.

365
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,370
My gosh!

366
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,080
Teacher!

367
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,240
Teacher, are you okay?

368
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,480
Well, yes.

369
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,380
My apologies, Young Master Yoon Bok.

370
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,000
I did not mean to do that.

371
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Of course, you did not.

372
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,970
But I do not think you should apologize to me.

373
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,330
I'm okay.

374
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,030
My apologies.

375
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,650
It's okay.

376
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,750
Are you hurt at all?

377
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,150
No, I'm okay.

378
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,810
- Are you okay? 
 - As long as you do not show up out of nowhere,

379
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,930
I will be just fine.

380
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,140
There's no one outside.

381
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,640
I already checked before I came out.

382
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,390
What is it that you want?

383
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,150
Follow me.

384
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,280
Surprise.

385
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,850
What is this?

386
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,220
It's a cart.

387
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,080
- Cart? 
 - The name doesn't matter.

388
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,660
Instead of carrying things one by one on your head,

389
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,970
use this comfortably.

390
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,950
Have you been acting suspiciously to make this?

391
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,550
What do you mean, suspiciously?

392
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,350
I made it silently like the wind or cloud without anyone noticing.

393
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,860
Sure.

394
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,300
Just go ahead and eat instead of doing useless things.

395
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,730
Useless?

396
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,960
Useless...

397
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,350
Let me know if you want more.

398
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,780
 I can repair it if it breaks. 

399
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,200
   

400
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,780
Yoon Bok, thank you so much for today.

401
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,220
Do not mention it.

402
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,970
I am sorry I could not persuade the villagers.

403
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,730
Don't apologize.

404
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,580
No one tries to help others as much as you.

405
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,240
You are not just anyone. This is for your dream.

406
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,480
Of course, I should help you.

407
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,240
   

408
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:55,290
   

409
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,900
Did you eat?

410
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,540
Yoon Bok, do you not miss Mom?

411
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,220
- To be honest, Mom— 
 - Do not ever...

412
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,420
mention her in front of me again.

413
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,320
Mom is very ill.

414
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,090
It has nothing to do with me.

415
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,770
 Here's my number. 

416
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:33,160
 Call me if you need a part-timer. Okay? 

417
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,280
   

418
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,890
   

419
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,150
 Stop acting stuffy and take it. 

420
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,420
 Seriously. 

421
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,100
 What is she... Let's move. 

422
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,720
 Thank you. 

423
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,190
   

424
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,390
Huh? Why is this open?

425
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,500
   

426
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,240
 Young Master, we are in trouble. 

427
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,560
 Seongsan Village, the contemporary Joseon village. 

428
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,800
 Their expensive, traditionally made products turned out to be imported from abroad. 

429
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,490
 Not only that, they were factory-made low-quality products. Did you know? 
   

430
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,250
 You can't just say sorry. You should've checked thoroughly. It ruined my appetite. 

431
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,530
 We'll make it up to you next time. 

432
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,450
 Seongsan Village's soybean paste doesn't taste as good as it used to. 

433
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,090
 These are the cloisonné earrings I bought in Seongsan Village. 

434
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:39,790
 And these earrings cost 2,000 won, and I bought them while traveling abroad. 

435
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,690
 Look. Don't they look the same? 

436
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,190
 The informants said they can no longer trust Seongsan Village's products. 

437
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,820
 Does this look like an artisan made it? 

438
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,000
 Do you think consumers are fools? 

439
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,190
   

440
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,970
 Seongsan Village made a fool out of the people of the country. 

441
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,030
 Seongsan Village made a fool out of the consumers! 

442
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,660
 You want to be forgiven just once? 

443
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,830
 No, you lost your business. 

444
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,640
Seongsan Village is being accused of selling fake products.

445
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,190
The scandal is going viral online and

446
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,280
it's expected to seriously affect the residents of Seongsan Village.

447
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
 The Cultural Heritage Administration, 

448
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,690
 which is selling Seongsan Village's goods, is in the hot seat, too. 

449
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,300
 The Cultural Heritage Administration and Seongsan Village started responding to the issue, 

450
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,420
 but the backlash is expected to grow stronger. 

451
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,380
Tons of return and refund requests are coming through on the

452
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,790
Cultural Heritage Administration's website, too.

453
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,050
Complaints from the customers are flooding in, too.

454
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,870
How did this happen, exactly?

455
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,440
You have got to be kidding.

456
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,590
Father!

457
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,110
My gosh! My gosh...

458
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,030
Our soybean paste is fake?

459
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,480
How does that make any sense?

460
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,600
I will burn my own hand if this is fake.

461
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,540
God damn it!

462
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,540
- Please calm down. 
 - Let go, you bastards!

463
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,960
- You might hurt yourself. 
 - Goodness!

464
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,220
You have got to be kidding.

465
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,240
Goodness!

466
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,080
I made these shoes from scratch by staying up several nights,

467
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,430
but they say they are trash?

468
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,350
Sir, how does this make sense?

469
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,740
We are about to starve to death!

470
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,570
Sir! Sir!

471
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,100
How does this make sense?

472
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,450
This is so unbelievably unfair!

473
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,830
How will we survive if the year's harvest goes to waste?

474
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,840
We have been protecting the village for generations.

475
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,670
Our ancestors are about to come out of the grave in fury.

476
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,290
Everyone, calm down.

477
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,040
I am looking into the matter.

478
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,900
Do not get agitated and wait.

479
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,230
 How does this make sense? What do we do... 

480
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,500
Anything noticeable while delivering?

481
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,450
I didn't notice anything.

482
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,720
Thank you.

483
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,390
The products were fine when they were sent from the village,

484
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,450
but they were swapped with fakes when they arrived.

485
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,310
How unbelievable is that?

486
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,490
Did you find the man who posted the video?

487
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,170
It was an illegal IP address from abroad.

488
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,560
I think someone did this on purpose.

489
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,160
 These annoying bastards... 

490
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,100
Okay, got it.

491
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,510
 Seongsan Village is being accused of selling fake products. 

492
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,990
 The scandal is going viral online and... 

493
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,010
 it's expected to affect the Seongsan Village's residents seriously. 

494
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,240
   

495
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,030
 Yoon Bok, I saw the news. 

496
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,220
 Are you okay? 

497
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,170
 Let me know if I can help with anything. 

498
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,830
- Hello? 
  - I have a package for you. 

499
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,900
 I hope you achieve your dream and only walk on paths covered with petals. 

500
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,680
 Your student, Shin Yoon Bok. 

501
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,690
 Seongsan Village is being accused of selling fake products. 

502
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,840
 The scandal is going viral online and it's... 

503
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,370
Looks like it's time for the final solution.

504
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,290
 The Cultural Heritage Administration, 

505
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,410
 which is selling Seongsan Village's goods, is in the hot seat, too. 

506
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,360
The delivery driver might have missed something.

507
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,700
Check the vehicle route thoroughly.

508
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,350
Okay.

509
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,560
Get home safely.

510
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,720
   

511
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,960
   

512
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,650
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

513
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,570
Yoon Ah!

514
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,580
Yoon Ah! What's wrong?

515
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,660
We had a good time.

516
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,090
Good time? Says who?

517
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:43,860
If I was lacking somehow, I'll try to improve.

518
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,250
Come on. Do not ever bring that up again.

519
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,010
Y-Yoon Ah? Yoon Ah?

520
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,110
Y-Yoon Ah!

521
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:05,100
Was I that bad?

522
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,650
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't try to stop me.

523
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,490
I decided to be a strong man starting today.

524
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,800
Okay, whatever.

525
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,420
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

526
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,710
I bought that for myself.

527
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,950
You bought it with my money.

528
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,580
A man who's good at drinking is also strong.

529
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,530
You're trying really hard.

530
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,200
You'll hurt yourself doing that.

531
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:34,090
Strong men aren't afraid to get hurt.

532
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,690
What do you know about strong men?

533
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:42,770
Getting buff and acting tough won't make you strong.

534
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,870
A truly strong man...

535
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,920
has a strong spirit that doesn't get wavered even in difficult situations.

536
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,350
But he has a gentle sensitivity when it comes to women.

537
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,630
 Are you hurt at all? 

538
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:04,540
He's like a combination of bulgalbi and ice cream.

539
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,980
He's both tough and soft at the same time.

540
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,630
- He's— 
 - Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside?

541
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,410
Yes, that's it.

542
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,830
Someone who writes you a letter with a muscular arm.

543
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:17,720
A man like that is a truly strong man.

544
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,970
If so, I'll grow muscles on one arm

545
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,020
and be sensitive with the other arm.

546
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,280
What do you think? Isn't it surprising?

547
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,230
   

548
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,840
 Yoon Bok, I'm always grateful for you. 

549
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,110
 Having you by my side makes me feel secure. 

550
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,110
What's this?

551
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,630
Huh?

552
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,770
Yesterday, I definitely...

553
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,770
went downstairs...

554
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:14,250
and I definitely put it in there.

555
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,060
Where did it go?

556
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,480
Sis, have you seen my letter?

557
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,030
- What? 
 - I definitely wrote the letter and set it here yesterday,

558
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,780
but it's gone.

559
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,330
Gosh, what do I do?

560
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,830
Hey, what did you write in that letter?

561
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,280
Me?

562
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,620
I just wrote one sentence like a man.

563
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,250
I said, "I love you."

564
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,790
What?

565
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,260
Hong Do Kim, get in now.

566
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,160
Pardon? Why?

567
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,230
- Just one moment. 
 - There's no time! Hurry!

568
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,060
Wait, I...

569
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,130
   

570
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,370
Where's the grand ballroom?

571
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:03,540
   

572
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,250
Bonjour.

573
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,100
Bonjour.

574
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:24,160
Is it true that your first fashion show in Asia will be held in Korea?

575
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,470
Yes, that's correct.

576
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,290
Have you decided on the date and location?

577
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,970
The date is to be determined, but the location has been decided.

578
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:39,520
The Camille fashion show location in Korea will be...

579
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,370
Seongsan Village.

580
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,610
Seongsan Village?

581
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:57,710
Is there a specific reason you decided to have a fashion show in Seongsan Village?

582
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,470
Because it's a perfect location for Camille's theme,

583
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,070
the evolution of tradition.

584
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,640
Oh, and...

585
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,560
Hong Do Kim.

586
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,570
She's my source of inspiration who brought me to Korea.

587
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,700
Starting with this show, Hong Do Kim will show off her talents in Paris.

588
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,910
She will be Camille's rising star.

589
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,100
   

590
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,910
   

591
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,330
What?

592
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,600
   

593
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,560
What's this?

594
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,210
 What? 

595
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,060
What's going on?

596
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,390
What is it?

597
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,200
What's this?

598
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,640
   

599
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:24,130
 Because it's a perfect location for Camille's theme... 

600
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:44,190
The final solution she was talking about must've been this.

601
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,310
Thanks to her, the fake news seems to have been forgotten.

602
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:54,580
By the way, how much of this did Camille plan?

603
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,610
Yoon Bok!

604
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,310
Are you here for the press conference?

605
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,870
I wonder if she discussed this with your grandfather.

606
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,180
Did you hear anything, by chance?

607
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,380
I...

608
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,870
have a question to ask you.

609
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,230
Yes, what is it?

610
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,510
By chance,

611
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,560
was the dream you wanted to achieve through the fashion show...

612
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,860
is going to Paris?

613
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,200
You heard.

614
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:59,090
Yes, that's right.

615
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:04,070
Becoming a designer for Camille in Paris is my dream.

616
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,790
If so, will you leave for Paris...

617
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,750
after the show?

618
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:18,840
Of course, I have to go if she'll take me.

619
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,720
 Are you... 

620
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,290
 abandoning me? 

621
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,200
 Yoon Bok! 

622
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,310
♫  With nervous feelings  ♫

623
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:44,480
♫  Everything was you  ♫

624
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,420
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

625
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,590
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

626
00:57:54,590 --> 00:58:00,770
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

627
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,110
 Call me. 

628
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:09,500
 You can also call me whenever you feel tired... 

629
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:14,140
 and want to get fresh air. 

630
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,090
By the way, how come you look so upset?

631
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,990
By chance, did you see that?

632
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,220
Actually...

633
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,920
I didn't write that.

634
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,890
But it's not like...

635
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,830
it's that far off from how I feel—

636
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,410
Teacher,

637
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,230
this is it.

638
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,480
What?

639
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,970
Please...

640
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,250
do not approach me any further.

641
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:05,740
♫  Everything was you  ♫

642
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:10,900
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

643
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:16,080
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

644
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:22,000
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

645
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:32,570
♫  I wonder if you're also under the same night sky  ♫

646
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:41,500
♫  I looked for you everywhere that night  ♫

647
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,980
♫  But you were nowhere in sight  ♫

648
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:51,820
   

649
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,780
I want to order these shoes.

650
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,350
What size do you want?

651
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:04,640
Well, the thing is... Her size is...

652
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:11,370


653
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,790
They're about this much smaller than my feet.

654
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,860
This smaller?

655
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,980
   

656
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,800
 Master said he approves the fashion show. 

657
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,400
 - Bravo! 
 - But... 

658
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,530
 - under one condition. 
 - Condition? 

659
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,130
 Yoon Bok, what's wrong? 

660
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,640
 Why are you suddenly avoiding me? 

661
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,860
 I know it is your will, but I cannot go along with it. 

662
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,450
