1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
   

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:09,010
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,790
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,620
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,260
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,060
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:30,050
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,730
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,150
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,990
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:55,040


12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,650
You will catch a cold if you get rained on.

13
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,550
I will do it.

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,070
You should stay under the umbrella.

15
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,670
It is done.

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,130
It might be uncomfortable since there is only one umbrella,

17
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,740
but I will walk you home.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,960
Are you okay?

19
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,360
Huh?

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,990
Yes, I'm okay.

21
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,800
Looks like you got wet more than me.

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,410
I am okay.

23
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,940
Let us go.

24
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,540
Okay.

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,380
Yoon Bok, carry the umbrella properly.

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,240
You're getting all wet.

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,390
I am okay.

28
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,420
No, you aren't. What if you catch a cold?

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,310
I cannot dare to step on your shadow.

30
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,080
You can't even see the shadow since it's raining.

31
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,790
- Put it on, I said. 
 - I am okay.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,060
No, I'm okay.

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,560
Look at this. I like getting rained on.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,060
I like it even more.

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,200
L-Let's go.

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
Yoon Bok.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,600
Yes.

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,410
Thank you.

39
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,570
Do not mention it.

40
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,180
I am just doing my duty as your student.

41
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,020
Let's share the umbrella.

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,240
Seriously.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,360
T-Teacher!

44
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,060
   

45
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,170
Yoon Bok turned out so well.

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,420
But has he...

47
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,400
always been that handsome?

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,450
 Shin Yoon Bok. 

49
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,210
 Is your name Shin Yoon Bok? 

50
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,080
 - Yes. 
 - Put it on, I said. 

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,200
 - I am okay. 
 - No, I'm okay. 

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,710
He seems to have gotten taller and bigger, too.

53
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,810
That kid.

54
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,370
He turned out well.

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
Is she the stalker?

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,500
- My goodness. 
 - How about the copying rumor?

57
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,690
She must've lied.

58
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,570
   

59
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,460
Look at this.

60
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,780
It was a lie?

61
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,940
   

62
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,060
   

63
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,660
Hey, Kim Hong Do! What's this?

64
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,240
The evidence that my design was copied.

65
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,420
I quit.

66
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,130
Oh, my god. Honey! Honey, hold on!

67
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,850
Honey, hold on, hold on, hold on!

68
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,130
Why would you quit over something like this?

69
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,120
- How could I keep working here... 
 - W-What?

70
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,090
when I'm accused of copying a lowly assistant's design?

71
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,040
- Lowly? 
 - Hyang Gi, don't be like that.

72
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,190
Our company will be in danger if you leave now.

73
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,270
I know.

74
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,250
Can I be walked all over like this?

75
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,210
No, not at all.

76
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,580
 To me, you are the most impressive and... 

77
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,480
 precious person in the world. 

78
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,300
Is it okay to walk all over me, then?

79
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,290
Does anyone deserve to be walked all over in this world?

80
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,940
I'm a precious daughter and sister to someone, too, and...

81
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm an impressive teacher, too!

82
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,680
How dare an assistant do this?

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,670
- You'd better— 
 - I quit!

84
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,810
How dare you cut me off—

85
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,580
You've been cutting me off a lot, too, Team Leader.

86
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,700
How does it feel to be cut off by someone else?

87
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,290
What the hell is wrong with you!

88
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,610
Yes, go ahead and quit.

89
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,200
I'll make sure you can't work in this field if you leave now. Wait and see.

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,500
Pack your things now!

91
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,870
 Could it be... 

92
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,960
 Camille? 

93
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,500
- Hong Do Kim? 
 - Pardon?

94
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,110
- Yes. 
 - Nice to meet you.

95
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,640
It's me, Bok Soon.

96
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,730
 Boksoon? Isn't it a scammer? 

97
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,590
Looks like things got loosened up now.

98
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,430
Very good timing.

99
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,590
- Let's go. 
 - Pardon?

100
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm scouting you as a designer for Camille.

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,950
   

102
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm Camille Brand's CMO, Frankie Leroix.

103
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,970
Nice to meet you.

104
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,130
It's an honor to meet you.

105
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,640
Korean Cultural Heritage Administration requested Camille

106
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,190
to have a fashion show to celebrate the return of cultural heritage many times.

107
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,150
I thought we were saying no again this time,

108
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,050
but she suddenly changed her mind.

109
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,220
She's insisting on doing it in Korea.

110
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,700
Because of this.

111
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,780
Really? Gosh.

112
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,700
You improved the boring part of the bokjumeoni. 
  (Traditional Korean bag that symbolizes luck) 

113
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,540
I tried modifying the norigae, a traditional Korean ornament, and used it.

114
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,860
Bon choix.  (Good choice) 

115
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,960
Thank you.

116
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,480
There are no set work hours.

117
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,420
You just need to come in before me.

118
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,940
Don't ignore my calls.

119
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,030
I hate it when people ignore my calls.

120
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,560
Whether it's midnight or 2:00 in the morning in Korea or the US,

121
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,380
just come in 30 minutes whenever I call you.

122
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,130
And...

123
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,200
there's nothing I hate more than workaholics.

124
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,660
Keep a work and life balance. Okay?

125
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,100
Okay.

126
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,150
Thank you!

127
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,080
The designer is the brand's face.

128
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,250
You always have to shine.

129
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,150
So, don't bow down from now on.

130
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,040
 That's how I escaped being a lowly servant 

131
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,970
 and became a fancy servant! 

132
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,540
What's going on? What's going on?

133
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,250
   

134
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,830
They're local gang members.

135
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,800
I guess they've been working two jobs secretly.

136
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,620
They both went into hiding now.

137
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,390
- They went into hiding? 
 - Yes.

138
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,540
The burner phone was disconnected, and they suddenly couldn't be reached.

139
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,670
These bastards...

140
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,420
This is the key chain that's attached to the key to the Seongsan Village storage.

141
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,780
Wasn't this destroyed by the fire?

142
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,050
The man, who is assumed to be Gamjjok, was carrying it, apparently.

143
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,000
A burn mark was seen on his arm, too.

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,880
Burn mark?

145
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
Does it mean he was at the fire scene?

146
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,210
Is Gamjjok after Seongsan Village's storage, by chance?

147
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,930
You will have to reinvestigate the case from 17 years ago.

148
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,070
If Gamjjok really is after the treasure in the storage,

149
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,360
he would attempt to enter the village, wouldn't he?

150
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,960
Tell the Chief Gatekeeper to strengthen security at the Seongsan Gate

151
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,280
and look for the ones who came to the village secretly 17 years ago.

152
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,970
Okay.

153
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,550
Young Master, are you okay?

154
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,250
I am okay.

155
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,500
Let us go.

156
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,020
 On the way to and from work, 

157
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,810
 when you eat, walk, sleep, 

158
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,450
 or even poop every moment, 

159
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,610
 every object you've encountered, 

160
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,800
 the sound, smell, and the atmosphere. 

161
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,230
 Bring me everything that's Korean. 

162
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,490
 Give me your foot! 

163
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,750
 Hey, hey. 

164
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,730
 Don't get discouraged just because you're a weak man. 

165
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,330
So cool.

166
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,140
"Strong woman."

167
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,460
What?

168
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,810
Are you sure you are okay?

169
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,410
You're flushed and sweating.

170
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,440
It looks like you might have a cold.

171
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,130
I said I was okay.

172
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,460
Young Master.

173
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,040
"Young Master"?

174
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,540
Perhaps you have a high fever.

175
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,740
I told you not to cross the line.

176
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,150
But I'm your bodyguard, Young Master.

177
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,840
Bodyguard?

178
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,170
Your safety and health are my responsibilities.

179
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,570
Even great loyalty is nothing if not controlled by politeness.

180
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,160
Go ahead and find out what I ordered you to.

181
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,620
Young Master!

182
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,500
Nice.

183
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,410
Nice, nice.

184
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,980
 The scallops will be on sale for only 20 minutes starting now! 

185
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,110
 The scallops are only 5,000 won per 100 g. 

186
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,960
Five thousand won?

187
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,300
 Young Master, the medicine is getting cold. 

188
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,210
 Why are you doing this now? 

189
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,500
 You need to eat a lot... 

190
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,290
 to make His Excellency in heaven happy. 

191
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,660
 Tell my mom or sister to bring it, then. 

192
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,920
 I will not eat the medicine you give me. 

193
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,100
 Gosh, seriously... 

194
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,950
 How dare you shed tears? 

195
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,170
 Get up and take the medicine now. 

196
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,750
 I do not want to. 

197
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,230
 Where did my mother and sister go? 

198
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,800
 Why are they not visiting me when I am sick? 

199
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,710
 I said your mother left the village with your sister. 

200
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,160
 Listen carefully. 

201
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,420
 You are the eldest son of the Woorim Shin family, who will lead this village. 

202
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,860
 So don't get consumed by personal feelings. 

203
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,390
 Do not waste your emotions waiting for the ones who will not return, either. 

204
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,620
 You can only trust yourself in this world. 

205
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,940
 So overcome it by yourself. 

206
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,830
 You should leave, Yeojudaek. 

207
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,060
Gosh!

208
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,850
Hi.

209
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,650
Has he always been like that?

210
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,760
- What did you say? 
 - I mean, Yoon Bok.

211
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,390
He's always been drawing lines with people since high school,

212
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,770
so we called him Seon Yoon Bok, not Shin Yoon Bok. 
  (Means "line") 

213
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,430
Who are you that you dare to call him by his name?

214
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm Hong Hak.

215
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,990
Kim Hong Hak.

216
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
 - Are you okay? 
 - Well... 

217
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,340
 Yes. 

218
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,430
That weak man.

219
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,790
Yes, that's right.

220
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,500
You were Yoon Bok's bodyguard.

221
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm Yoon Bok's best friend.

222
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,300
I am not sure how close you are to Young Master,

223
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,480
but there is a reason why he is drawing the line.

224
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,310
So, do not speak rudely of him.

225
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,670
H-Hold on.

226
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,890
I haven't come up with a title yet.

227
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,640
Well...

228
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,150
Your name... What's your name...

229
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,280
E-Excuse me.

230
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,270
I can just ask Yoon Bok.

231
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,130
Hey, bro!

232
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,600
It's too early to sleep already.

233
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,940
Get up for a second.

234
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,310
You know, your bodyguard...

235
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,260
What's her name—

236
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,670
Hot.

237
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,520
Hey, Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok!

238
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,480
Scallops are only 5,000 won!

239
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,990
Thank you.

240
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,850
Here you go. Enjoy.

241
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,050
Scallops are only 5,000 won.

242
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,560
What is it?

243
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,140
Sis...

244
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,470
Someone's very sick.

245
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,310
Sick? What's wrong?

246
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,760
 Not me. It's Yoon Bok. 

247
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,960
Yoon Bok? Yoon Bok is sick?

248
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,740
Looks like he got the flu.

249
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,760
He's totally boiling...

250
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,130
Aren't you buying?

251
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,030
Hang up for now.

252
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,890
Sir, I will have abalone, too.

253
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,330
Scallops and abalone?

254
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,840
Okay, then!

255
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,870
- Scallops are... 
 - I want a lot. A lot.

256
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,970
Fifty thousand won.

257
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,270
H-Hello?

258
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,570
   

259
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,190
   

260
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,590
Why do I feel so heavy?

261
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,620
Who is it?

262
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,320
 Yoon Bok, it's me. 

263
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,650
Teacher?

264
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,310
 Yes. 

265
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,570
You came all the way to my place to give me this?

266
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,540
I felt bad since I heard you were sick.

267
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,660
You caught a cold because of me.

268
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,690
Not at all.

269
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,130
It happened because I did not take care of myself. Do not worry.

270
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,830
Okay. I won't worry.

271
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,890
Instead, let's switch seats.

272
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,060
But a teacher is like a king and—

273
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,860
I know, I know. "A teacher is like a king and father."

274
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,110
It's an order from your teacher, who's like a king and father.

275
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,070
Will you not listen to me?

276
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,700
If so...

277
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,360
I will go there.

278
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,720
Okay.

279
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,710
Will you feel comfortable sitting here?

280
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,640
No.

281
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,680
Here. This is good.

282
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,260
Have a seat.

283
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,600
Okay.

284
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,930
Eat a lot and get well soon.

285
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,850
You should eat with me.

286
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,220
No, no. I made it for you.

287
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,160
No.

288
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,300
Here you go.

289
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,820
I said I'm okay.

290
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,910
Let us enjoy it together.

291
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,260
 "Together"? 

292
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,740
Okay. Let's eat together.

293
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,760
Abalone?

294
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,770
Did something happen to the ocean?

295
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,540
This is definitely an abalone shell.

296
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,400
But it tastes like a scallop.

297
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
What is it, a hybrid or something?

298
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,060
She couldn't have given all the abalone

299
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,690
to our neighbor instead of her cute brother...

300
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,500
She...

301
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,160
did.

302
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,840
I really enjoyed it, Teacher.

303
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,920
No, no, no. No, no.

304
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,450
Stay there. I'll put it away.

305
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,980
That is impossible. You cannot—

306
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,990
Come on. Will you really go against your teacher's will?

307
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,300
- My apologies. 
 - I'll do everything.

308
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,300
The sick student should stay put right here and lie down.

309
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,500
What?

310
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,070
Does no one care for him?

311
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,620
Oh, right.

312
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,420
Yoon Bok, something great happened to me today.

313
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,090
He should sleep comfortably to recover quickly.

314
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,010
Seriously.

315
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,030
Yoon Bok,

316
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,120
I was motivated when you told me I was a great teacher.

317
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,760
So, I tried being courageous today.

318
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,600
And something really cool actually happened.

319
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,910
It's thanks to you, Yoon Bok.

320
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,760
Thank you.

321
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,360
 He's so handsome— 

322
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,670
 Gosh, what am I thinking when he's sick? 

323
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,800
It is warm, Teacher.

324
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,370
Teacher.

325
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,010
 Yoon Bok, did you sleep well? 

326
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,290
 I put the rest of the porridge in the fridge. 

327
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,540
 Heat it up later, and don't forget to take the medicine. 

328
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,400
 You need to eat well when you are ill. 

329
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,670
 Okay? 

330
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,290
I am greatly indebted to her again.

331
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,990
One out!

332
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,090
- Pardon? 
 - One out!

333
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,250
Stop being Losi Fashion's assistant.

334
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,520
I hired you as a designer, not an assistant.

335
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,150
Got it.

336
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,470
Nouveautés et harmonie.

337
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,740
I hate designers who don't get that.

338
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,230
- Nouveautés? 
 - Nouveautés et harmonie.

339
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,290
Newness and harmony.

340
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,460
It's Camille's philosophy in fashion.

341
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,060
Something traditional and new.

342
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,290
Elegant and splendid.

343
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,000
Bright and dark.

344
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,260
Hot and so cold.

345
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,450
Something like that.

346
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,060
What Camille wants is a double-edged sword.

347
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,160
"I will not lose out on anything." Something like that.

348
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,190
But, Hong Do Kim, you're a bit...

349
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,580
You're very refreshing,

350
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,420
but that's all there is.

351
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,320
Gosh, I'm so nosy. Follow me.

352
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,630
This is all Camille?

353
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,970
My gosh!

354
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,110
So pretty.

355
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,010
Use these to sharpen the double-edged sword if necessary.

356
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,280
Is that really okay?

357
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,890
Camille is a woman who's like wine.

358
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:47,200
She can be sweet, but she can send you away immediately.

359
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,990
I hope you survive without striking out three times.

360
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,900
Fighting.

361
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,860
Thank you.

362
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,970
My gosh!

363
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,720
So pretty. My gosh.

364
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,740
Here you go.

365
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,720
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

366
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,320
Where are the other documents?

367
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,340
Okay... Shall we look for it, then?

368
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,840
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

369
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,480
Hello, sir.

370
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,940
Hello.

371
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,310
♫  I hide it and try to push it away, but it's already here  ♫

372
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,870
♫  You smiled at me brighter than sunshine  ♫

373
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,260
   

374
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,430
♫  I need you  ♫

375
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,330
♫  Come back to my side anytime  ♫

376

377

378

♫  Let's shine together  ♫

381
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,980
♫  The only person who makes me breathe  ♫

382
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,800
♫  Wait for me like a tall tree  ♫

383
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,800
♫  Just thinking about it warms me up  ♫

384
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,730
♫  I can only rest in you  ♫

385
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,770
♫  For me, if it's you, it's all right  ♫

♫  Let's shine together  ♫

389
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,650
♫  Every day is about you  ♫

390
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:24,620
♫  I've been hiding my heart for a long time  ♫

391

394
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:57,870
♫  In my world, it's you who shines brightly  ♫

395
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,330
   

396
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,300
Two out!

397
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,590
Using jagae cases as a party purse? 
  (Traditional Korean craft using mother-of-pearl) 

398
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,710
I like the idea of reinterpreting the classical beauty,

399
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,920
but isn't it too obvious?

400
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,630
The whole world already knows about the Jagae cases.

401
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,910
What to do?

403
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,300
   

404
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,290
Wow, there were tons of visitors.

405
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,350
Gamjjok could've been among them.

406
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,970
Study each person even though it might be time-consuming.

407
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,400
Okay.

408
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,040
 Brought to you from Seongsan Village— 

409
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,460
 Fire! Fire! 

410
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,120
 Fire! 

411
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,990
 - There's smoke! 
 - Where? Where? 

412
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,290
 Stop being Losi Fashion's assistant. 

413
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,470
 I hired you as a designer, not an assistant. 

414
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,960
 Camille is a woman who's like wine. 

415
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,570
 She can be sweet, but she can send you away immediately. 

416
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:27,450
 I hope you survive without striking out three times. 

417
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,340
It'd be really over if I struck out again tomorrow.

418
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,440
Is Yoon Bok feeling better?

419
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,290
I couldn't care for him since I've been working.

420
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,220
Where was it?

421
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,480
Here it is.

422
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,330
This is it.

423
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,180
   

424
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,880
Yes.

425
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,760
This is called "yeolsoepae" used by noblemen in the Joseon era.

426
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,040
They used to exchange these as wedding gifts with keys attached to them.

427
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,660
To put it simply, it's a symbol of wealth and love.

428
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,530
So?

429
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,870
People prefer quick flings rather than tiring romances.

430
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,460
Romance is dead these days.

431
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,720
But we'll pursue old classic "romance".

432
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,670
We'll use the symbol of love as the show's concept.

433
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,090
You're finally like a designer.

434
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,400
Think about what to make using this concept, then.

435
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,910
Okay.

436
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,690
   

437
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,950
It's an honor...

438
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,600
to entertain the most famous designer in the world.

439
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,860
You look better than when I saw you in Paris.

440
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,990
My wife completely overcame menopause depression.

441
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,360
Thanks to the Camille purse you sent her.

442
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,850
Then, you'll create a stage wherever I want. Right?

443
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,780
Yes, just ask me.

444
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,470
Gyeongbok Palace, the Blue House, or anything.

445
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,940
I'll make it happen as the director of the Cultural Heritage Administration.

446
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,070
You're good at making jokes.

447
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,630
What? Me?

448
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,050
What joke?

449
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,270
Gyeongbok Palace and the Blue House.

450
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,860
You want me to have a show where other brands have already been?

451
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,290
That's so funny.

452
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,210
Director.

453
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,880
I'm Camille.

454
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,140
I'm only interested if I'm the first one to do it.

455
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,320
A place that's never been exposed.

456
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,530
Somewhere no one had a show before.

457
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,360
A place like that suits Camille.

458
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,430
What place has never been exposed in Korea in the 21st cen—

459
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,530
By chance, is that the place you want?

460
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,800
Yes.

461
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,520
No, not Seongsan Village.

462
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,200
I won't do it unless it's this place. 
    

463
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,400
I'd like to help you, too.

464
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,850
But you know Mr. Shin Soo Geun.

465
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,100
He cherishes the village in case something negative might happen.

466
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,200
How could I change his mind?

467
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,040
I'm sure no one can.

468
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,980
No one?

469
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,560
I can't even go outside.

470
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,710
This is basically a prison. A prison.

471
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,910
Gosh, my back.

472
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,340
Put it by the door when you're finished.

473
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,070
Hold on.

474
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,930
What?

475
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,040
Is this everything?

476
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:31,640
I've never had a meal without meat.

477
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,370
Are you serious?

478
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,730
You're complaining about food when I'm providing food and lodging?

479
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,560
Don't eat it if you don't want it.

480
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,270
Gosh.

481
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,450
I mean...

482
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:52,390
a vegetarian diet is good for your health.

483
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:57,160
I prepared this for your health.

484
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,840
I'll fry you an egg next time if you insist.

485
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,590
Thank you for the food.

486
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,240
Gosh, he scared me.

487
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,950
Gosh, how high and mighty.

488
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,360
What? He won't eat a meal without meat?

489
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,860
Bull crap. He has the face of a bear.

490
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,940
I should only feed him with mugwort and garlic for 100 days. 
  (Referring to Korean folktale) 

491
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,280
If it wasn't for Young Master, I would've... seriously...

492
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,190
Geez!

493
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,280
He said he didn't want it. He stuffed it down so quickly.

494
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,470
Wow, what's gotten into the miserly Kim Hong Do?

495
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,230
Eat that. This is for Yoon Bok.

496
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,780
Come on. This looks tastier to me.

497
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,660
Wow, seriously.

498
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,990
I'm your younger brother. It's me.

499
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,170
It's me, I said.

500
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,630
Yoon Bok is sick.

501
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,790
Geez, move.

502
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,730
Heavens,

503
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:30,690
why did you grant me such a sturdy body?

504
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,600
How could you...

505
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,450
What's he saying?

506
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,640
Okay...

507
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,670
I think my body is finally aching.

508
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,080
Bodyguard!

509
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,650
Bodyguard! Bodyguard!

510
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,890
Bodyguard.

511
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,810
Why are you doing this?

512
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,170
- What's your name? 
 - Why should I tell you?

513
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,190
- Because I want to know. 
 - I do not want to tell you.

514
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,800
What would make you want to tell me?

515
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,960
- That will not happen. 
 - Don't be like that and tell me.

516
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,260
I do not want to.

517
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,950
If you ask my name again,

518
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,120
I will add your name to the list of the dead.

519
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,930
I warned you.

520
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,760
Beautiful roses have thorns.

521
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,040
It stings.

522
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,450
 If you ask my name again, 

523
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,790
 I will add your name to the list of the dead. 

524
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,510
 I warned you. 

525
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,920
If you ask... If you ask...

526
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,500
   

527
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,320
"If you ask my name again,

528
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:24,810
I will add your name to the list of the dead."

529
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,900
"Maiden!"

530
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,580
Maiden, my foot.

531
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,860
 Teacher did me a great favor. I should return the favor now. 

532
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,190
Welcome.

533
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,110
Hello.

534
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,900
Who is this?

535
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,260
Can you not hear me?

536
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,300
 Yoon Bok. 

537
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,940
 Yoon Bok. 

538
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,830
Yoon Bok, have you been well?

539
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,250
I do not know who you are.

540
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,620
I will hang up.

541
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,910
 Yoon Bok, hold on— 

542
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,830
Is he not home?

543
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,440
Yoon Bok.

544
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,200
Teacher, I know this is too much to ask,

545
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,950
but will you...

546
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,910
have a drink with me?

547
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,580
Yoon Bok, is something going on?

548
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,730
It must be serious since you suggested drinking.

549
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,830
You're sick, too.

550
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,150
What's going on?

551
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:32,160
I was contacted by the one who cut ties and left a long time ago.

552
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,270
Someone who left?

553
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,800
I am sorry I am making you worry again.

554
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,070
No, I'm okay.

555
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,480
She must've been someone very precious to you.

556
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,430
Since you're hurting so much now.

557
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,770
I thought I was used to being alone,

558
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,300
but I guess that is not necessarily the case.

559
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,550
No one is used to being alone.

560
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:15,320
And why are you alone? You have Hong Hak and me.

561
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,820
I'll drink with you or listen to you if you're struggling.

562
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,760
I'd do anything.

563
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,220
So, lean on me anytime.

564
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:33,030
Why are you so kind to me, Teacher?

565
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,740
What?

566
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,330
Come on, I didn't do anything.

567
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,280
It's my job as your teacher...

568
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,360
I should've cared for you sooner.

569
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,580
I've been so negligent.

570
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,590
Not at all.

571
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,540
You have always been affectionate toward me.

572
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,920
Even the ones who approached me with kindness

573
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,640
grew uncomfortable and left after a while.

574
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:12,060
But you have always been kind whenever I struggled.

575
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,120
That is why you are...

576
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,480
someone I want to be close to.

577
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,710
 What's this? 

578
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:38,130
 I'm your teacher, and you're my student. 

579
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,930
 We can't be doing this... 

580
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,260
Well, I'm so glad that...

581
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,970
you think that way.

582
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,480
Of course, I want to be close to you, too.

583
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,760
But...

584
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,870
Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok...

585
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,230
Yoon Bok...

586
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,820
You were a terrible drinker.

587
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,270
Yoon Bok.

588
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,110
Yoon Bok. Yoon Bok, let's go home.

589
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,580
- Wake up. 
 - Teacher...

590
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,260
Where are we?

591
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,080
Be careful.

592
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,770
Are you okay, Yoon Bok?

593
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,950
Yes, I am very much okay.

594
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,320
You don't look okay.

595
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,750
I am totally fine.

596
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,990
By the way, you seem drunk, Teacher.

597
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,890
What?

598
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:05,020
Your face looks orange.

599
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,130
My face?

600
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,240
Orange...

601
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,330
Yes, yes. You're very drunk. Let's go. Let's go.

602
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,930
Let's go, Yoon Bok.

603
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,210
T-Teacher,

604
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,640
you cannot do this.

605
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,190
Watch where you're going. Be careful.

606
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,010
Teacher...

607
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,490
You cannot...

608
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,680
Have a seat, Yoon Bok.

609
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,740
This is no good.

610
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,880
Yoon Bok, I'll get you something to drink.

611
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,940
Wait here for a moment.

612
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,770
Are you...

613
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,320
abandoning me?

614
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,830
What?

615
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,000
Why would I abandon you?

616
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,770
Wait here for a moment. I'll be right back.

617
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,590
Will you be back when I am done counting to "on"? 
  (Means "100" in old Korean) 

618
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,370
On?

619
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,960
Oh, on?

620
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,290
Yes, I understand.

621
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,000
I'll be back by then. Wait a moment.

622
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,700
If so...

623
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,530
Okay.

624
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,840
One.

625
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,620
Two.

626
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,350
Three.

627
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,670
Four.

628
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,830
Where did all the convenience stores go?

629
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,400
 21. 

630
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,250
 22. 

631
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,130
 23. 

632
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,540
There it is.

633
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,520
 37. 

634
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,860
 38. 

635
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,930
 39. 

636
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,220
 40. 

637
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,820
   

638
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,010
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - There's a famous fried chicken shop in your neighborhood. Right?

639
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,540
Fried chicken?

640
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,920
Oh, you mean, "No Chicken Ever Tasted Like This"?

641
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,490
Yes, that place.

642
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,660
I'm in front of it right now.

643
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,560
Come out to get fried chicken with me.

644
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,300
- Right now? 
  - You know how much I hate eating alone. 

645
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,630
- Come in 30 minutes. 
 - Wait—

646
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,810
87.

647
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,010
88.

648
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,470
89.

649
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,850
90.

650
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,740
91.

651
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,560
92.

652
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,310
 Mother, 

653
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,330
 are you going somewhere? 

654
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:16,250
 I am about to step outside the village with your sister. 

655
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,460
 Take me with you. 

656
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,630
 We will be back soon. Count to "on" here slowly. 

657
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,230
 We promise to be back by then. 

658
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,630
 One. 

659
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,830
 Two. 

660
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,370
 Three. 

661
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,590
 Four. 

662
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,150
 Five. 

663
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,080
 Six. 

664
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,620
 Seven. 

665
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,350
 Eight. 

666
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,490
 97. 

667
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,950
 98. 

668
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,350
 99. 

669
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,660
 99. 

670
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,220
 90. 

671
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,850
 91. 

672
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,070
 92. 

673
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,540
 93. 

674
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,320
 94. 

675
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,100
 95. 

676
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,300
 96. 

677
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,760
 97. 

678
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,100
 98. 

679
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,540
 99. 

680
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:43,560
 I have been wasting my emotions, as Grandfather said. 

681
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,850
On.

682
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,260
 Yoon Bok! 

683
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,690
♫  When the stars show up in the dark sky  ♫

684
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:30,730
♫  It was so very beautiful  ♫

685
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:37,690
♫  I've been picturing it in the sky  ♫

686
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,740
♫  Like this, I meet you again, like it was meant to be  ♫

687
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:48,510
♫  Oh, I... Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

688
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:56,640
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

689
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,510
   

690
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,680
♫  I've been hoping for a long time  ♫

691
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:09,040
♫  I waited for you endlessly for many days  ♫

692
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:16,490
♫  As long as I can stay with you  ♫

693
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:19,310
   

694
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,540
Yoon Bok, the weekend starts tomorrow. What's your plan?

695
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,430
I do not have any specific plans.

696
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:29,890
Really? Want to go on a city tour with me for a change, then?

697
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,730
- A city tour? 
 - Yes.

698
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,210
An event for my student, Shin Yoon Bok, who's feeling down.

699
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,830
It's Kim Hong Do's treat!

700
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,020
Okay, sounds good.

701
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,350
You mean it, right? We're going, okay?

702
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,990
- Okay. 
 - Oh, yay!

703
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,310
City tour.

704
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,570
Have you been on one?

705
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,140
No, this would be my first time.

706
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,130
Watch the steps. Watch it.

707
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,780
Just one second.

708
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:01,670
Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok! You should go inside.

709
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,610
Here, here.

710
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,530
Good night, Teacher.

711
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:09,320
Yes, bye. Good night.

712
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,900
Ma'am!

713
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:28,160


714
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:33,240
Over here. We'll have an order of "No Chicken Ever Tasted Like This."

715
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,920
Okay.

716
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:41,070
♫  I want to hug you but I guess I'm scared  ♫

717
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:44,820
   

718
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,870
 I haven't had so much fun in a while. 

719
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,650
 I'm the happiest when I spend time with you. 

720
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,870
 Spending time with me? With me? 

721
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,770
 Who's your higher-up who told you to stand guard? 

722
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:57,060
 I wouldn't be alive if I knew who he was. 

723
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,260
 - Could it be... 
 - What's he doing in the room? 

724
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,190
 Yeojudaek, you looked at me last night, didn't you? 

725
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,820
 D-Did I? 

726
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,400
 Young Master Yoon Bok brought a woman! 

727
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,470
 - Is she pretty? 
 - Hello, Lady Se Ryeong. 

728
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,640
 I asked if that woman is good-looking. 

729
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,940
 Take this criminal out of the town square immediately! 

730
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,890
 Hold on! No! 

731
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,200
 Please, ahjussi! 

732
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,100
♫  The only person who makes me breathe  ♫
