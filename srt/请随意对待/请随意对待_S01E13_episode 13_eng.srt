1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
   

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,300
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,810
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,040
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,230
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,810
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:29,710
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,130
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,630
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,430
   

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,440
   

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:59,030


14
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,790
Long time no see.

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,490
   

16
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,720
 I sincerely hope you meet a good person 

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,000
 who understands your gentle heart 

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,630
 and be happy. 

19
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,080
 What? Excellency Lee brought a bag of cash from outside? 

20
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,840
 Does it mean someone is helping him from outside? 

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,700
 To find out who that is, we have to get close to Excellency Lee. 

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,120
 Would you be able to? 

23
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,900
 Me? 

24
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,730
 Well, it looks like I'm the only one who could do it. 

25
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,650
 Please. We'll leave it to you. 

26
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,890
 Be careful. 

27
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,720
 He is cautious and watchful. 

28
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,660
 He won't open up easily. 

29
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,980
 Unless he sees Camille turning his back on you... 

30
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,520
 he will not buy it. 

31
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,660
 If so, 

32
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,260
 what should we do? 

33
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,400
 I want you to... 

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,980
 step down as the village leader. 

35
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,100
 That is the only way to fool Excellency Lee. 

36
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,230
 This is a fake document that says I agreed to 

37
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,100
 take money from you for allowing the fashion show. 
   

38
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,650
 Are you telling me to betray you? 

39
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,650
 Excellency Lee would not buy it otherwise. 

40
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,040
 What do you think? Do you think people would believe this? 

41
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,220
 People tend to see what they want to see. 

42
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,160
   

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,290
 I am thinking of turning your lie into truth. 

44
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,940
 If so, 

45
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,120
 what is this? 

46
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,700
 You are trying to make a profit by scheming with this woman! 

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,550
 - Hong Do Kim. 
 - Yes. 

48
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,130
 Try it. 

49
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,500
 How could you do that, Ms. Camille? 

50
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,610
 - Again. 
 - How could you do that, Ms. Camille? 

51
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,490
 Ms. Camille! 

52
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,280
 What is going on? 

53
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,180
 Ms. Camille, how could you do this? 

54
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,050
 Grandfather helped us so much. 

55
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,540
 Aren't you going too far? 

56
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,230
 Hong Do Kim, there's nothing I can't do for work. 

57
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,400
 They say Heaven chooses the king, not the people. 

58
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,150
 Looks like you were destined to sit on top. 

59
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,600
 To be honest, I didn't think the situation would change so quickly. 

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,220
 This is all thanks to the old servant of the Woorim family- 

61
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,340
 Who did you mention just now? 

62
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,390
 Excellency Lee definitely said... 

63
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,970
 that he used to be a servant for the Woorim family. 

64
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,360
 Does it mean Joon Ho was behind Excellency Lee? 

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,720
 How could Joon Ho do such a thing? 

66
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,880
 Yes. 

67
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,790
 I found it. 

68
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,690
 The door is unlocked. 

69
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,140
 The door has been opened. 

70
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,400
 There should be a wooden box in the village storage. 

71
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,020
 Bring the letter that is in there. 

72
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,570
 Do I have to do it now? 

73
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,360
 You got to live a nice life after being at the bottom. 

74
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,770
 But that nice life of yours can be gone immediately. 

75
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,160
 Think carefully and consider your mother's safety. 

76
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,120
 This is your last chance to defeat the Woorim Shin family. 

77
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,490
 ­  

78
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,270
   

79
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,730
 Yes. 

80
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,520
 As long as I can destroy the Woorim family... 

81
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,880
   

82
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,250
 Why is Joon Ho taking things so far? 

83
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,900
 Yoon Bok, this must be very hard for you. 

84
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,020
 Not at all. I am more worried about you. 

85
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,440
 You don't have to worry about me. 

86
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,250
 That is the village storage where we keep precious objects inherited from our ancestors. 

87
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,690
 I've seen that before. 

88
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
 Pardon? 

89
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,150
 Yes, the painting I saw inside the closet at Seongsan Hall. 

90
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,970
 It was of that. 

91
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,740
 There was a painting of the village storage at Joon Ho's place? 

92
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,100
 Yes. 

93
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,340
 Young Master. 

94
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,860
 Did you figure out Lee Joon Ho's whereabouts? 

95
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,550
 We are still looking for him. 

96
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,960
 The thing is, the black-market dealers are saying 

97
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,880
 Gamjjok is preparing a major deal. 

98
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,870
 A major deal? 

99
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,980
 Joon Ho had a map of the village storage 

100
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,900
 because he's been planning to break into it. 

101
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,610
 He even has the key to it. 

102
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,340
 Grandfather, who has been protecting the storage, 

103
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,600
 must have been a thorn on his side. 

104
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,070
 So, 

105
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,470
 while looking for a solution, 

106
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,020
 he probably decided to bring in Excellency Lee 

107
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,050
 who was dissatisfied with the Woorim family. 

108
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,950
 Because as long as Grandfather stepped down, 

109
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,100
 he can access the storage easily. 

110
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,510
 If so, I should open the door for him myself. 

111
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,510
I have told you.

112
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,100
That I will...

113
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,250
catch you, no matter what.

114
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,870
It is all over now.

115
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,910
Quit now.

116
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,360
I did feel uneasy about how things were going too smoothly.

117
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,680
Shin Yoon Bok, you were pretty clever this time.

118
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,960
Why are you doing such a thing?

119
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,130
To make money off the cultural heritage?

120
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,620
Money?

121
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:29,460
Is that the best reason you could come up with your smart brain?

122
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,730
Why are you doing this, then?

123
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,020
Seongsan Village.

124
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,580
Tradition.

125
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,150
The Woorim Shin family.

126
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,250
Those must be just beautiful names that were handed down to you.

127
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,860
But not to me.

128
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,660
As a servant...

129
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,740
do you know how I've been living here,

130
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,560
what I've seen,

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,230
and what I had to go through?

132
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,440
Do you know?

133
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,880
 - You bastard! 
 - My gosh! 

134
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,180
 I am sorry, sir. I am sorry. 

135
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,630
I saw my mother apologize for everything, but I couldn't say a thing.

136
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,380
I wasn't even allowed to be affectionate to my mother. Do you know...

137
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,320
how I felt...

138
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,750
leaving this village?

139
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,740
Do you know?

140
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,040
I wanted to get rid of everything.

141
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,080
Everything your grandfather cherished.

142
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,570
The treasures.

143
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,400
Tradition. The Woorim Shin family!

144
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,680
I wanted to destroy everything! Everything!

145
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,110
- Hyungnim. 
 - Don't look at me like that.

146
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,130
You grew up without any worries as the young master.

147
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,370
Don't pretend as if you understand me.

148
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,080
No matter what the reason is...

149
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,310
you cannot justify your crime.

150
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,080
So...

151
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,630
please stop now.

152
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,440
Please...

153
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,410
do not destroy yourself anymore.

154
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,360
Mr. Lee Joon Ho,

155
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,940
you're under arrest for theft and breaching the Cultural Heritage Protection Act.

156
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,830
 I took tradition for granted, 

157
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,210
 but I did not realize it could... 

158
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,820
 actually hurt someone. 

159
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,600
As the new leader of Seongsan Village,

160
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,770
I will protect tradition and let Seongsan Village be known by many.

161
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,610
Excuse me, I have a question.

162
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,190
Go ahead.

163
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,750
Is it true that you assisted Gamjjok in stealing from the village storage?

164
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,980
Gamjjok? What do you mean—

165
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,810
Mr. Lee Jae Chool, you'll have to come with us regarding

166
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,040
Seongsan Village's theft case.

167
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,380
What are you talking about?

168
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,230
Please come with us.

169
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,010
What are you doing?

170
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,630
Let go of me!

171
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,580
What's going on?

172
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,870
Let go of me! Come on!

173
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,280
 Let him go!­ 

174
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,360
Your Excellency!

175
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,240
 Let us not go. 

176
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,270
 Let us stay a bit longer. 

177
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm so sick of it.

178
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,420
You were the only one I cared about in that family.

179
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,090
- Joon Ho. 
 - I was out of my place to even do that.

180
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,500
If I could've...

181
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,620
done what I wanted to do,

182
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,990
I wouldn't have been tricked so cruelly like this.

183
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,990
   

184
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,550
 Here. 

185
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,740
 You used to want this whenever you got sick. 

186
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,980
 Mom used to make this for me. 

187
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,650
 Eat it while it's hot. 

188
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,060
 Here. 

189
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,020
 Come with me. 

190
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,150
Welcome. It must've been difficult being away from home.

191
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,700
Thank you for your hard work.

192
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,870
You two worked very hard.

193
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,910
Everything worked out well.

194
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,950
Are you both going to Seoul today?

195
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,530
We need to prepare for the show.

196
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,290
What will you do, Yoon Bok?

197
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,430
Well...

198
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,330
I am planning to stay for a few more days.

199
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,390
It is okay. You can get going, too.

200
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,040
No, you are not feeling well yet.

201
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,290
How could I leave you alone—

202
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,410
You should leave now.

203
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,960
Will you be okay?

204
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,500
I am just tired because I was worried.

205
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,650
Do not worry.

206
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,310
Let's prepare for the fashion show here.

207
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,230
- Pardon? 
 - We cleared up the misunderstanding with the villagers

208
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,820
and it's cumbersome to go back and forth.

209
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,780
Why don't we move the HQ near the stage?

210
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,320
Go ahead and do so.

211
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,710
I will get things set up.

212
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,160
 Why are you doing this? 

213
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,210
I would be too ashamed to keep serving you.

214
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,480
I am sorry, Master.

215
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,260
I am sorry.

216
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,040
He was under my care, too.

217
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,620
But I have not taken good care of him.

218
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
Do not mention it.

219
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,550
You took me in when I had a newborn and had nowhere to go.

220
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,040
You took such good care of us.

221
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,960
But we returned the favor like this.

222
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,540
It is all my fault.

223
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:06,270
 I will seek your forgiveness afar for the rest of my life. 

224
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,800
 Yeojudaek, do not do this. 

225
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,290
 Thank you for everything. 

226
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,230
 Yeojudaek. 

227
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,200
Yes!

228
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,610
I am so sorry.

229
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,200
I did that to Joon Ho.

230
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,540
You must resent me a lot.

231
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,230
Not at all. Why would you say that?

232
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,050
You just did what you were supposed to do.

233
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,630
I do not know how to face you anymore.

234
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,170
I know I am asking a difficult favor,

235
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,500
but could you just stay here with us?

236
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,870
You know that...

237
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,850
you are like a mother to me.

238
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:18,120
My mother died after suffering after leaving the village.

239
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,470
I cannot let you end up the same way.

240
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,430
Young Master.

241
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,000
No matter what happened,

242
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,890
you have always embraced me.

243
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,810
You are like home to me,

244
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,610
and my hometown, but if I let you go like this,

245
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,460
I will not be able to forgive myself.

246
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,730
I am sorry, Young Master.

247
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,380
Until Joon Ho comes back,

248
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,630
I will try to fill his empty spot.

249
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,520
So, please do not leave

250
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,940
and stay by my side.

251
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
I beg you.

252
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,530
Is she okay?

253
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,300
She must be having a hard time.

254
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,930
Please...

255
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,930
take good care of her by her side.

256
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,030
Lee Joon Ho, you have a visitor.

257
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,180
- Have you eaten? 
 - What do you want?

258
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,680
I am here to update you on your mother.

259
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,330
She was shocked to hear what happened,

260
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,630
but thankfully, she has calmed down now.

261
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,750
I will treat her like my mother while you are gone.

262
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,560
Do not worry about Yeojudaek, and be well.

263
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,840
And...

264
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,250
there is one thing I want to ask.

265
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,940
Hyungnim,

266
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:15,980
are you linked to my father's death from seven years ago?

267
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,010
The key chain you had in your possession.

268
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,030
My father had been wearing that...

269
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,440
until he passed away.

270
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,250
By chance, if you—

271
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,940
I know nothing about it.

272
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,320
We're done talking.

273
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,710
 ­  
   
   

274
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,740
  ­ 

275
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,070
Okay.

276
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,000
I'll look further into Father's case.

277
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,800
Go back and care for the village.

278
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,270
Would you be okay on your own?

279
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,250
It's my duty.

280
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,960
I'll call you if I need your help.

281
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,880
Further inside. Further inside. Be careful.

282
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,800
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

283
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,630
That, too. That, too. That, too. Yes, yes, yes.

284
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,690
Model?

285
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,310
I heard Frankie gave you his business card already.

286
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:06,230
I also think you'd be the perfect main model for my fashion show.

287
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,520
I am not good at stuff like that.

288
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,420
I can make you become good at it.

289
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,170
What are your thoughts?

290
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,860
If Yoon Bok wants to...

291
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,300
The first fashion show in Seongsan Village.

292
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,750
The entire world would be watching.

293
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,650
I want to...

294
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,720
show them the true face of Seongsan.

295
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,660
Okay, I understand.

296
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,990
Okay!

297
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,560
Pardon? Yoon Bok will be the main model?

298
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,490
Bravo. I have excellent taste in models.

299
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,450
Okay, let's get busy.

300
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,300
We'll find a spot to build the stage

301
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,570
and check on the catering process, too.

302
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,230
Bring whatever inspiration you get from the villagers' fashion, too.

303
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,760
Ask Yoon Bok if you have any questions about the village.

304
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,900
Right, you have to be polite if you run into a villager.

305
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,340
There's nothing they value more than manners here. Okay?

306
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,650
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

307
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,230
What happened?

308
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:59,080
Ms. Camille said she wanted to show Seongsan's face.

309
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,660
I...

310
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,930
am its face, you know.

311
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,470
I am happy that I can be with you while you are working.

312
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,760
Look for a spot for the stage on the other side of the hill.

313
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,620
We'll be looking around here.

314
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,280
On the other side of the hill?

315
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,600
I have a cardio exercise allergy.

316
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,110
I can't climb hills or stuff like that.

317
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,870
W-What? Cardio exercise allergy?

318
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,500
Is there such a thing?

319
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,010
Okay, then. We'll go that way.

320
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,110
Let's go, Yoon Bok.

321
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,670
Yes!

322
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,060
Seriously, she's too much.

323
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,410
She's always wearing headphones and doesn't hear me.

324
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,160
She doesn't get work done in time unless I give her a deadline.

325
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,560
I feel like I'm my assistant's assistant.

326
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,300
Just now, too.

327
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,440
She comes up with all sorts of excuses if something seems a bit hard.

328
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,680
I can tolerate her doing that with just us,

329
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,710
but she can't do this in front of you, too.

330
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,980
I do not think it is too bad that we came this way.

331
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,380
I have always wanted to come here with you someday.

332
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,900
- Let us go. 
 - Okay.

333
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,460
Gosh, it's so beautiful here.

334
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,530
When it is time for the fashion show,

335
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,860
things will turn red because of the azaleas that way.

336
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,260
And that way, there will be sprouts popping up.

337
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,610
It will be as picturesque as five-colored silk.

338
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,590
When I was a kid,

339
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,360
my father brought a boat here

340
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,070
and let me ride it.

341
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,540
He must have been very sweet.

342
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,920
Yes.

343
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,150
Since this is a place of fond memories to me,

344
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:40,790
I want it to leave fond memories for you, too.

345
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,580
Yes, I'm sure it will.

346
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,990
Look!

347
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,500
Should we go check it out?

348
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,260
- Yes. 
 - Let's go. Let's go.

349
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,970
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

350
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,340
She moved the HQ to my house,

351
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,670
but it would be impolite not to stop by

352
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,410
as the owner of the house.

353
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,390
Hold on.

354
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,860
I cannot go empty-handed.

355
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,970
  ­ 

356
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,870
Who are you?

357
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,840
It's me, Camille.

358
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,770
Gosh, you scared me.

359
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,650
By the way, what's that?

360
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,910
You can't get a spa treatment at Seongsan Village.

361
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,280
My skin got so dry these days.

362
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,350
So, I brought it to care for my skin.

363
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,260
Let me try it, too.

364
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,670
Geez, you want to try everything that's good for you.

365
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,070
Here.

366
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,940
My gosh, it's so warm.

367
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,630
Lady, are you in there?

368
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,470
Gosh, the wrinkles are gone. The wrinkles are gone.

369
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,400
Really?

370
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,130
- Here, here, here. 
 - Where?

371
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,340
They're gone!

372
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,320
Oh, Shin Soo Geun.

373
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,710
I-I found this plant on the way.

374
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,340
Keep it here, or throw it away.

375
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,510
Anyway, I will leave since you look busy.

376
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,110
Men and women need to stay separated. How could they?

377
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,980
Did the location scouting go well?

378
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,940
Yes.

379
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,910
Oh, really?

380
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,240
Can I look at the pictures, then?

381
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,530
What's...

382
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,400
By chance...

383
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,400
- did you take just one? 
  - Yes. 

384
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,470
Wait! You didn't check out other places?

385
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,390
- Other places? Where? 
 - What?

386
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,970
You told us to look around here. So we stayed here.

387
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,040
So, you only checked out here. Just here?

388
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,210
- Yes. 
 - You little-

389
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,390
Teacher, there is a famous soup place nearby.

390
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,690
Let us stop by before you go.

391
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,340
Okay. Let's.

392
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,800
Geez, that sounds tasty.

393
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,540
I love soups.

394
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,070
I'll post on social media.

395
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,380
Me, too. Me, too. I love it.

396
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,800
- Let us go. 
 - Geez.

397
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,900
How old are you?

398
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,330
I am 24.

399
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,630
Huh? We're the same age. Same age.

400
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,380
Can I talk to you casually?

401
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,900
It is okay.

402
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,350
Do you have a girlfriend?

403
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,690
I'm curious. I'm curious.

404
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,730
Yes, she is right there.

405
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,750
- What? 
 - Whoa.

406
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,340
Tonight's dinner is on me.

407
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,820
- Really? 
 - Really?

408
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,770
I heard you are my girlfriend's assistants.

409
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:59,790
I would like to ask you to assist her well going forward.

410
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,520
So, enjoy yourselves.

411
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,170
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

412
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,370
Teacher, help yourself.

413
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,610
Thank you.

414
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,280
Please eat, both of you.

415
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,050
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

416
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,530
Wow, this is good.

417
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,780
Will Yeojudaek cheer up if she ate this, too?

418
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,360
Here, have some, Yoon Bok.

419
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,340
Thank you, Teacher.

420
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,490
That's my Hong Do.

421
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,260
It's so tasty.

422
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,220
Hong Do.

423
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,420
I missed you.

424
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,290
Is she not back yet?

425
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,920
Who are you?

426
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,670
Kim Chil Bok?

427
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,340
Dad?

428
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,820
"Dad"?

429
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,520
I did not know you were the Teacher's father.

430
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,670
I am very sorry.

431
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,680
Hong Do.

432
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,760
Why are you here, Dad?

433
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,760
Why would you talk to him that way?

434
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,090
Do not criticize Hong Do.

435
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,340
There is a reason for it.

436
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,580
And who's the one to blame for it?

437
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,900
When I think about how much I suffered with Hong Hak...

438
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,780
I...

439
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,390
find it difficult to face you like this.

440
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,020
So, don't show up in front of me.

441
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,680
Okay.

442
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,770
I'm a sinner.

443
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,920
I'm sorry, Hong Do.

444
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,440
S-Sir...

445
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,360
Sir.

446
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,910
 ­Gosh. 

447
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,760
I am letting you see all sorts of things.

448
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,740
I am sorry.

449
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,210
It is okay.

450
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,220
After Hong Do's mom passed away early on,

451
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,690
I acted out a lot.

452
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,430
I had no desire to keep on living.

453
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:38,230
So, I even tried to follow her path, but...

454
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,170
It was a terrible thing to make the kids go through.

455
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,080
So trying to start things over, 
    

456
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,810
I took out loans here and there

457
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,520
and opened a restaurant.

458
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,910
 Welcome. 

459
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,270
 What are you doing? 

460
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,740
 Pardon? 

461
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,000
 What are you doing at my shop right now? 

462
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,130
 - Who are you? 
 - I'm the owner of this shop. 

463
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,960
 - Pardon?  
 - It turns out I was scammed.

464
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,920
I even lost the house we were living in.

465
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,010
I felt too guilty to face my kids.

466
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,590
I didn't see the point of living.

467
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,320
 Are you okay? 

468
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:15,930
I was going to go back to the kids once I paid off the loans, but...

469
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:24,070
I completely understand why Hong Do is so angry.

470
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,910
So, please comfort her for me, Young Master.

471
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,310
I beg you.

472
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,670
He should've done better for himself if he abandoned his kids.

473
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,640
Yoon Bok, you must be tired from walking around with me today.

474
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,690
Go ahead and rest.

475
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,960
Teacher, are you okay?

476
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,310
Of course. Why would I not be okay?

477
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:43,490
He abandoned us when we were kids.

478
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,660
Not only did he try to kill himself...

479
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:30,100
 I'm starving. 

480
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,120
...he even put us out on the streets.

481
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,550
I stopped caring for him a long time ago.

482
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:49,390
I got angry earlier because I remembered how much Hong Hak and I went through.

483
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,740
I'm really okay.

484
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,270
Don't worry about it, and get some rest.

485
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,530
You must have...

486
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,530
had a tough time.

487
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,810
I know.

488
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,290
I know.

489
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,410
I thought I brought it.

490
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,770
I found it.

491
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,790
 The wrinkles are gone. The wrinkles are gone. 

492
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,490
 Really? 

493
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:35,770
 - Here, here, here. 
 - Where? 

494
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,250
What does that have to do with me?

495
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,470
Why am I so bothered by it?

496
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,810
 Are you in there? 

497
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,010
What is going on?

498
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,100
I was just curious about something.

499
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,130
Are you done working?

500
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,850
You seemed very busy.

501
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,630
How could I be done with work? You have to keep at it.

502
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,060
What brings you here?

503
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,850
Well...

504
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:19,490
I brought too much by mistake.

505
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,550
Take one every morning and evening.

506
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,010
Vitamins, stomach supplements, liver supplements,

507
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,950
joints supplements, circulation supplements, and calcium.

508
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,750
You brought all these by mistake?

509
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,800
I know. I'm all over the place.

510
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,780
Go to bed. I'll leave.

511
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,170
That was smooth.

512
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,520
Here are the catering menu options from the Village Wives' Association.

513
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,510
Here are the photos of the sites.

514
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,900
- This one's nice. 
 - Right?

515
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,620
It's even more beautiful in person.

516
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,710
We can use this square as the runway.

517
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,320
If you put lights here, it'd look so cool.

518
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,230
Tres bien.

519
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,360
Share the photos and info with the stage director.

520
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,890
Okay.

521
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:54,950
Hello, I'm Kim Hong Do, a designer at Camille Korea.

522
00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:00,970
We picked the fashion show site. I sent the photos.

523
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:05,160
Please have a look and get back to me. Thank you.

524
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,990
Hong Do Kim!

525
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:15,000
When did you study French?

526
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,700
You can go to Paris now without a hitch.

527
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,860
I still have a long way to go.

528
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,310
Yoon Bok,

529
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,970
did you practice walking at all?

530
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,730
- Pardon? 
 - Starting today and until the fashion show day,

531
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,860
be on stage every day and practice walking.

532
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,760
You'll need to practice since you're not a pro model.

533
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,090
Okay, I will.

534
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,540
Hong Do Kim can help him with it.

535
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,050
Okay.

536
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:50,650
You have to practice every single day without skipping a day.

537
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,290
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

538
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,210
When would you be free?

539
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,180
Should we do it every lunch break?

540
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,020
Yes, that works for me.

541
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,810
I will go with your schedule.

542
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,360
Okay, let's do that.

543
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,790
Okay.

544
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,300
   

545
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:23,530
 Are you linked to my father's death from seven years ago? 

546
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,070
 The key chain you had in your possession. 

547
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:30,090
 My father had been wearing that... 

548
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,400
 until he passed away. 

549
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,860
 By chance, if you— 

550
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,950
 By chance, did he kill Excellency Shin? 

551
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,130
Come out, Lee Joon Ho.

552
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,500
You'll be transferred to a detention center.

553
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,730
   

554
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,970
May I make a phone call?

555
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,710
You can't.

556
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,520
- Just one phone call. 
 - No.

557
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,750
 ­  
   

558
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,880
 ­  

559
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:33,640
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

560
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:41,350
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

561
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,870
   

562
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:54,560
Have you known Camille for a long time?

563
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,250
I've probably known her for 40 years.

564
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,090
That's so unexpected.

565
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:06,200
She has never told me about you.

566
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,870
Really?

567
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,550
I've heard so much about you.

568
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,400
Looks like you are very close to her.

569
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,300
People tell us that we're like a married couple.

570
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:29,830


571
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,500
I suppose she worries about me a lot.

572
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,710
She brought me all these supplements.

573
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,930
Two, four, six, eight, and ten.

574
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,340
What's the deal?

575
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,470
You asked me to get good supplements.

576
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,030
Were they for your ex-boyfriend?

577
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,270
How did you know?

578
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:16,300
   

579
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,930
 What should I do if Yoon Bok inherits the village? 

580
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,390
 I will be by your side, no matter what I do. 

581
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,240
 Even if it means on the other side of the planet. 

582
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,030
 Go and tell Young Master Yoon Bok... 

583
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,930
 that I will meet with him just once. 

584
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:33,980
 Joon Ho said he would meet with you just once. 

585
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,690
 Teacher, I will be away from the village today due to an urgent matter. 

586
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:41,420
 I will return in the evening. Let us practice walking then. 

587
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,370
 Yoon Bok, is something going on? Call me. 

588
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,210
 Two stab wounds on the stomach. BP is 70/40. 

589
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,750
 It's dropping rapidly, and the organs might be damaged. 

590
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,730
 Yoon Bok. 

591
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,490
 Yoon Bok! 

592
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:00,530
♫  Would I be able to see you again?  ♫
