Yoon-bok!

5
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,789
<i>This is bad.</i>

6
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>This is real bad.</i>

7
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,886
<i>I don't have heart disease.</i>

8
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,888
<i>I'm just crazy.</i>

9
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,644
Why does it have to be you?

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,065
Out of all the men out there, why you?

11
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,323
Is that old guy your family or something?

12
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,201
That looks great.

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,663
<i>Though it was a long time ago,</i>

14
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,456
<i>he was my student.</i>

15
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,209
Here's to the 2013 freshmen
in the design major.

16
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,544
Cheers!

17
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,546
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

18
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,965
{\an8}Everybody, drink up!

19
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,259
{\an8}<i>I'm six years older than him.</i>

20
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,385
{\an8}THE YEAR 2013

21
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,262

22
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,638
{\an8}KIM HONG-DO, 20 YEARS OLD

23
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,056
{\an8}Pour me another one.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,225
Let's go next time.

25
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,852
<i>And he's also my brother's friend.</i>

26
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,400
This is a line I just cannot cross.

27
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,610
I must never cross this line.

28
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,534
Well...

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,787
Never say never, right?

30
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,914
Those things didn't matter to me before.

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,005
They say love knows no boundaries,
so why not love who I want to love?

32
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,675
It's not a sin for a person
to like someone.

33
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,850
Get yourself together, Hong-do.

34
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,185
You're losing your mind.

35
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>Yoon-bok's handsome looks
just made my heart flutter for a bit.</i>

36
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,903
Look at these boys.

37
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,739
It's just like how I feel
when I look at them.

38
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,993
I'm not a teenage girl, am I?

39
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,749
I can control my feelings
as a thirty-year-old woman.

40
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,626
Get it together, Hong-do!

41
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,471
<i>These are trivial feelings
I can easily control.</i>

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,015
<i>They're like a soft breeze</i>

43
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,850
<i>that will soon go away.</i>

44
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>I was wrong.</i>

45
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>These feelings are like a typhoon,</i>

46
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,048
<i>and there's no stopping them now.</i>

47
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,216
<i>I can't control...</i>

48
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,678
<i>how I feel.</i>

49
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,390
Just a moment, Yoon-bok.

50
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,553
Is it too obvious?

51
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,947
I'm sorry, but I had to take a work call.

52
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,035
I see.

53
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,162
Did you sleep well?

54
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,041
Well,

55
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,210
I slept like a baby.

56
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,173
Did you sleep well, Yoon-bok?

57
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,425
Yes.

58
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,511
By the way, are you feeling unwell?

59
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,429
What?

60
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,600
Your neck seems stiff.

61
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,393
Does it?

62
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,978
My neck's all right.

63
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,521
I feel completely fine.

64
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,524
It also seems your voice has changed.

65
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,485
My voice?

66
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,111
I always sound like this.

67
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,114
As long as you are fine.

68
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,495
The weather's perfect today.

69
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,123
I guess it's time for me to go wash up.

70
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,585
I can't believe I let you see me
after I've just woken up.

71
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,420
Oh gosh.

72
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,547
Have a nice day.

73
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,694
EPISODE 6
YOU'RE A PUPIL, AND I'M YOUR MASTER

74
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,247
{\an8}That was smooth.

75
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,049
{\an8}I'll be back later.

76
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,678
{\an8}By the way, Hong-do and I are friends now.

77
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,348
{\an8}We're the same age, and she's really nice.

78
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,644
{\an8}We should invite her over
for a meal sometime.

{\an8}BASED ON THE WEBTOON
DARE TO LOVE ME BY SUN WOO

80
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,576
Go on and treat me like I'm invisible.

81
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm still not giving up on you.

82
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,399
Mom.

83
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,569
You're here early.

84
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,159
Ta-da.

85
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,369
What were you gazing at?

86
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,874
That tree over there.

87
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,336
All the other trees stand together,

88
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,255
but that one's all alone by itself,

89
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,008
just like Yoon-bok.

90
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,519
I met Yoon-bok, Mom.

91
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,105
He's all grown up now.

92
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,443
And he's got your genes for looks.

93
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,824
It doesn't seem like he's lonely at all.

94
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,495
There's even someone who likes him.

95
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,707
I'm glad to hear that.

96
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,309
Why did Yoon-bok look so different today?

97
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,521
It's almost like

98
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,441
he was more manly than usual.

99
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,114
I can't get him out of my head.

100
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,533
My heart's fluttering so much.

101
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,871
You're out of your mind.

102
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,000
You're crazy, Hong-do.

103
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,335
Get it together.

104
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,049
Gosh, my head hurts.

105
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,094
Calm down.

106
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,641
Hong-do Kim.

107
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,184
My office, now.

108
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,439
What's wrong?

109
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,443
Sorry?

110
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,946
You were directly rejected by Lord Shin?

111
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,159
Shin Su-keun is the first person
who has ever rejected me.

112
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,786
And I can't believe he's done it twice.

113
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,790
Korea is full of beautiful locations.

114
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,418
Just give up on Seongsan Village.

115
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,879
I either go big or go home,

116
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,381
but he's changed me.

117
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,844
From now on,

118
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,306
it's either go big or go big.

119
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,517
That man unleashed my competitive spirit.

120
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm only going big.

121
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,396
I'm going big no matter what.

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,023
I want nothing else!

123
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,486
-Hong-do Kim?
-Yes?

124
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,487
You want to go to Paris?

125
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,572
Yes, ma'am!

126
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,284
Let's host an amazing fashion show
at Seongsan Village

127
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,078
and fly to Paris together.

128
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,455
-Really, ma'am?
-Yeah.

129
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,853
I wouldn't be so happy
if I were you, Hong-do Kim.

130
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,105
Why not?

131
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,525
Until Camille gets to host
a fashion show at Seongsan Village,

132
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,861
she's staying here and not returning
to the headquarters in Paris.

133
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,905
Really?

134
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,117
If Lord Shin doesn't open the gate,

135
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,161
Camille won't be returning to Paris,

136
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,247
which means you won't get to go to Paris.

137
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,040
And that means I won't...

138
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,503
What a disaster.

139
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,384
What a bummer.

140
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,834
Do I really

141
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,463
look that weak to you?

142
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,510
To be honest,

143
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,139
I think you will lose
to me at arm wrestling.

144
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,315
Let's do it.

145
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,677
Instead of arm wrestling...

146
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,544
<i>Did I share a bed with a man?</i>

147
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,256
<i>And with Young Master's friend at that?</i>

148
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,968
<i>I've made a huge mistake.</i>

149
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,741
Yun-a...

150
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,754
Yun-a?

151
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,842
Yun-a?

152
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,185
STRONG LADY OH YUN-A

You are late.

157
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,015
My apologies.

158
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,392
Did anything happen overnight?

159
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:37,978
Overnight?

160
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,816
No, nothing happened.
What do you think happened?

161
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,821
I simply asked if anything happened
while I was in the village.

162
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,491
Why deny it so strongly?

163
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,745
When did I strongly deny anything?
I never did that.

164
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,830
You are doing it again.

165
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,876
Why are you staring like that?

166
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,588
Has something changed about me?

167
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,802
Now that you mention it,
you do seem a bit tired.

168
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,845
Not at all.

169
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,391
I'm not tired in any way at all.

170
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,269
That is a relief. Let us go.

171
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:50,259
I need to do whatever it takes
to change Lord Shin's mind.

172
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,603
It's a bit shameless,
but should I ask Yoon-bok again?

173
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,690
What?

174
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,608
I should ask him?

175
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,402
All right.

You may go if you have urgent business.

179
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,966
No, it's an unimportant call.
I'll just turn my phone off.

180
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,095
What if Inspector Park calls you?

181
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,600
I do not know who it is,
but it is impolite to avoid people.

00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,270
Either answer the call
or see them in person to solve your issue.

183
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:44,938
I will.

184
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,698
<i>Are you free tonight, Yoon-bok?</i>

185
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,241
<i>Could we meet for a moment?</i>

186
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,497
<i>Yes, I shall see you tonight.</i>

187
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,046
I have never seen you
exchange texts before.

188
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,552
May I ask who it is?

189
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,102
If I tell you,
will you tell me who is calling you?

190
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,479
Sorry? Well...

191
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,817
These are just spam calls.

192
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,612
They're trying to get me to buy land.

193
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,699
The person messaging me is my master,

194
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,034
who is also my neighbor.

195
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,787
Your neighbor?

196
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,250
That means your friend who lives next door

197
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,418
-is your master's...
-Brother.

198
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:49,962
I see.

199
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,881
Young Master!

200
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,222
Products from Seongsan Village are even
gaining popularity overseas these days.

201
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,561
I'm very happy to see
our country receive so much love.

202
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,856
From K-pop to K-Contents,
and now our cultural tradition.

203
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,860
I am glad to hear that the products
handmade by our artisans

204
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,653
are receiving such attention.

205
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,696
I feel the same.

206
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,824
Not long ago,
some shameless foreign company

207
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,787
tried to buy Lord Lee's family recipe
for gochujang.

208
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,997
Unbelievable, isn't it?

209
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,792
So I told them, "Go back to your country!"

210
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,087
You did well.

211
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,092
May I ask why you wanted to see me?

212
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,389
Well, the thing is, Young Master...

213
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,518
Please open the gate
just this once, Lord Shin.

214
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,396
I'll make sure
no harm befalls the village.

215
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,110
What? He said no again?

216
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
Go tell him I reject his rejection.

217
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,909
She rejected my rejection?

218
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,038
Then tell her I reject
her rejection of my rejection.

219
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,875
I reject his rejection
of my rejection to his rejection.

220
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,211
I have made myself clear already.

221
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:17,049
I may have to bar you
from entering Seongsan Village as well.

222
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,637
If he keeps being stubborn,
I'll have to turn to my last resort.

223
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,307
Tell her to suit herself.

224
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,311
It will be a cold day in hell
before I open the village gate.

225
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,367
Are you telling me you visited the village
several times today because of that?

226
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,119
I'm put in a very tough position.

227
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,539
which is why I arranged to see you

228
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,000
to ask for help.

229
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,985
Master.

230
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,196
Yoon-bok.

231
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,869
Shall we go?

232
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,538
Yes.

233
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,718
Change my grandfather's mind?

234
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,845
Yeah, what does he like?

235
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,555
What would he appreciate?

236
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,391
Seeing you try so hard,

237
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,769
your superior must be
just as stubborn as Grandfather.

238
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,690
A fruit basket? Or maybe ginseng?

239
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,859
Would he like that?

240
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,529
Is this matter that important to you?

241
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,532
Yeah, it's my dream.

242
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,035
Your dream?

243
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,662
If the fashion show goes through,

244
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,956
I can achieve my long-held dream.

245
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,751
I want to make it happen.

246
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,464
That's why I came to you for help again.

247
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,510
In that case, are you free tomorrow?

248
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,471
What?

249
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,890
The only way to change Grandfather's mind

250
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,892
is to win over the villagers.

251
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,813
He will grant his permission
if the villagers agree to it.

252
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh, so tomorrow...

253
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,568
Will you

254
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,613
go to Seongsan Village with me?

255
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,241
Yeah, of course.

256
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,749
Should I wear this?

257
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,210
Is it too much?

258
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,300
Is this better?

259
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,056
Let's see.

260
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,522
Hey.

261
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,690
What looks better on me?

262
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,818
-That one.
-This?

263
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,777
Yeah.

264
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,404
-You like this more?
-Yeah.

265
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,031
You just said you liked this one!

266
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,157
Yeah, that one.

267
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,201
Jeez, you're no help.

268
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,039
My heart aches.

269
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,293
I'm already weak as is,

270
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,213
and now my heart is becoming weak too.

271
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,008
Dear God,

272
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,261
how are you so cruel?

273
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,681
Why curse me with such a bitter day

274
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,183
after such a sweet night?

275
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,146
Yun-a!

276
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,483
<i>The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable. Please try...</i>

277
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,930
-Shall we go?
-All right.

278
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,899
Hello.

279
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,535
Walking with you like this
feels like being on a trip.

280
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,873
Since you took me on a trip around Seoul,

281
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,461
I shall take you on a trip to the past.

282
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,422
A trip? Don't say that.

283
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,132
I'm your master, and you're my pupil.

284
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,927
Someone might get the wrong idea.

285
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,470
Jeez, Yoon-bok.

286
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,513
The wrong idea?

287
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,058
What idea?

288
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,894
What?

289
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,147
Oh, I mean...

290
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,109
Someone might think
we're on a school trip.

291
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,300
Lady Se-ryung!

292
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,052
Come in.

293
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,979
Young Master Yoon-bok is here?

294
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,443
Are you in, sir?

295
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,997
This is beautiful.

296
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,416
Who is it?

297
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,919
Greetings.

298
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,297
If it is not Young Master Yoon-bok.

299
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,048
What brings you here?

300
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,260
I am here to discuss a matter with you.

301
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,059
Hello.

302
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,528
I am sorry but I am not interested
in any fashion shows.

303
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,238
See you next time.

304
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,073
Sir.

305
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,291
Are you in?

306
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,752
Young Master Yoon-bok.

307
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,003
How have you been?

308
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,590
We are here to discuss
hosting a fashion show in the village.

309
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,966
What?

310
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,801
What for?

311
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,387
I'm against the idea.

312
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,556
Wait.

313
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,934
You are suggesting
we open the village gate?

314
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,356
That is a no for me.

315
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,734
What?

316
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,904
You want to open the village gate?

317
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,575
I suggest you go ask someone else.

318
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:48,333
Hosting a fashion show here
would boost the village's economy.

319
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,085
Our economy's doing fine.

320
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,586
-Another bowl, please.
-Coming.

321
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,504
Wait, Ma'am...

322
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,424
-More kimchi, please.
-Coming right up.

323
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,427
We can do this. Let's go.

324
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,268
No, thank you.

325
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,812
Please hear us out.

326
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,480
-Just give us...
-I said no!

327
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,447
Sir!

328
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,242
Please give us a moment to talk to you.

329
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,035
Please, sir.

330
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,495
I am against it.

331
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,538
Wait...

332
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,500
I am against it.

333
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,711
I am against it.

334
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,799
I am against the idea.

335
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,436
Are you hungry, Master?

336
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,104
No.

337
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,566
Are your legs not tired?

338
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,900
Shall we rest for a moment?

339
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,402
I'm all right.

340
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,826
RED BEAN BINGSU

341
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,165
Would you allow me some of your time?

342
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,251
-What?
-It is Shin Yoon-bok's special treat

343
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,627
for his disheartened master,

344
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,172
Kim Hong-do.

345
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,841
-Follow me.
-Okay.

346
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,929
Special treat?

347
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,731
I used to come here whenever I was sad.

348
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,526
First, I lift my spoon...

349
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,697
crush all my stress away...

350
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,660
and enjoy the sweet dessert.

351
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,416
Really? Should I try it?

352
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,294
I'm crushing it.

353
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,254
Here I go.

354
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,760
It's so good.

355
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:10,517
You taught me
the sweet and salty rule, Master.

356
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,606
Since you endured such hardship today,

357
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,943
a sweet day will await you tomorrow.

358
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,572
Thanks.

359
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,284
Whether your day may be salty or sweet,

360
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,621
I shall be a shoulder you can lean on.

361
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,832
So please do not be discouraged.

362
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,250
Okay.

363
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,796
<i>How can my heart not flutter
when he talks like that?</i>

364
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,175
Please excuse me for a moment.

365
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,093
Okay.

366
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,689
Hello.

367
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,150
Oh, hello.

368
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,572
Are you here
with Young Master Yoon-bok again?

369
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,658
Yes.

370
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,493
Then...

371
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:15,915
did the two of you
have this dessert together?

372
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,585
Yes.

373
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,348
I should properly introduce myself
to Young Master's master.

374
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,476
I am Lee Se-ryung

375
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,688
and I am arranged to be married to him.

376
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,609
Well, I'm Kim Hong-do.

377
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,821
And I'm not sure
if Yoon-book thinks the same.

378
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,700
-Excuse me?
-I heard Yoon-bok say

379
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,619
he'll handle his own marriage.

380
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,162
I doubt that.

381
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,373
Lady Se-ryung.

382
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,251
Oh my!

383
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,419
Master!

384
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,049
Are you all right?

385
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,216
I'm fine.

386
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,367
I am sorry, Young Master.

387
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,994
It was an accident.

388
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,081
I know it was.

389
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:42,168
Yet it is not I
who you should apologize to.

390
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,379
It's okay.

391
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,881
My apologies.

392
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,676
It's all right.

393
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,220
Are you hurt?

394
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,013
No, I'm not.

395
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,283
Oh my goodness!

396
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,373
-Are you all right?
-I would be if you didn't show up

397
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,500
so suddenly all the time.

398
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,337
No one's outside. I checked.

399
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,590
What do you want?

400
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,134
Follow me.

401
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,397
Surprise.

402
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,568
What's this?

403
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,945
-It's a trolley.
-A troll?

404
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,780
It's not important what it's called.

405
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,878
From now on,
instead of carrying things on your head,

406
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,713
you can use this.

407
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,475
So you were acting suspiciously
all this time just to make this?

408
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,435
When was I suspicious?

409
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,855
I was as invisible as the wind
when I built this.

410
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,273
Sure you were.

411
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,484
Just hurry up and eat.

412
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,152
And stop wasting your time.

413
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,072
Goodness.

414
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,741
Wasting my time?

415
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,953
Wasting...

416
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,116
Let me know if you want more.

417
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,630
I'll fix it for you if it ever breaks!

SEOUL ↔ SEONGSAN VILLAGE

419
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,411
Thank you for today, Yoon-bok.

420
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,621
No, Master.

421
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,958
I am sorry
we could not convince the villagers.

422
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,252
Why are you sorry?

423
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,297
You went the extra mile
to help someone else.

424
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,549
You are not just someone.

425
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,050
It is only right

426
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,469
I help reach your dream.

428
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,928
Did you eat?

429
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,431
Yoon-bok, don't you miss Mom?

430
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,769
-To tell you the truth...
-Do not ever

431
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,272
speak to me about that person again.

432
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,817
She's very ill.

433
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,032
That does not concern me.

434
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,681
It's my number.

435
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,018
Call me if you're hiring, okay?

436
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,126

HIRING PART-TIME

438
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,057
Stop being so stubborn and sit down.

439
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,141
Jeez.

440
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,020
Let's go somewhere else.

441
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,648
Thank you.

442
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,012
Wait, why is this unlocked?

{\an8}SEONGSAN VILLAGE

YUN-A

445
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,531
<i>I have bad news, Young Master.</i>

446
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,409
{\an8}Seongsan Village claims
to uphold the traditions of Joseon.

447
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,286
{\an8}But did you know the "traditional" goods
they've sold expensively

448
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,621
{\an8}were made overseas?

449
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:19,041
<i>It turns out they are produced
in poor quality from factories.</i>

450
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,376
-How annoying.
-I'm sorry.

451
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,545
Sorry won't cut it.
You need better quality control.

452
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,671
That ruined our appetite!

453
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,965
We'll provide better service next time.

454
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:31,178
{\an8}The soybean paste from Seongsan Village
has changed.

455
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,849
{\an8}These are the cloisonné earrings
I bought at Seongsan Village.

456
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,936
{\an8}And these are 2,000 won earrings
I bought overseas.

457
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,605
{\an8}Take a look. They're identical.

458
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,151
{\an8}<i>Customers say they can no longer
trust products from Seongsan Village.</i>

459
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,861
{\an8}<i>This isn't the work of an artisan.</i>

460
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,238
{\an8}<i>Do you take the people for fools?</i>

461
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,073
{\an8}FOOLING CUSTOMERS?
BOYCOTT SEONGSAN VILLAGE!

462
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,534
<i>Seongsan Village

463
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,661
<i>and mocks its own customers!</i>

464
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,580
Oh, you want mercy?

465
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,498
We're never buying from you again.

466
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,334
A fake goods scandal
has engulfed Seongsan Village.

467
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,962
The scandal has spread like wildfire
on the Internet

468
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,924
and is expected to cause great damage
to the lives of the villagers.

469
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,093
The Cultural Heritage Administration
is also in a tight spot

470
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,012
as the seller of the village's products.

471
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,224
{\an8}<i>The Administration and Seongsan Village
are trying to settle the situation,</i>

472
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,101
<i>but the backlash
is expected to grow stronger.</i>

473
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,104
The Administration's website
is exploding with requests

474
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,564
for returns and refunds,

475
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,816
as well as complaints from customers.

476
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,694
How has this happened?

477
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,237
Damn this!

478
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,491
Here.

479
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,784
-No!
-My lord.

480
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,328
Damn it!

481
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,871
Oh no!

482
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,956
They say our soybean paste is fake?

483
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,334
That is utterly ridiculous!

484
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:48,547
I will be damned if this is fake!

485
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,466
Damn this!

486
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,347
-Please calm down.
-Let go of me!

487
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,766
-You might get hurt, my lord.
-Oh my goodness!

488
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,101
I can't believe this!

489
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,401
I spent sleepless nights

490
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,238
crafting these shoes
and now they're all as good as trash!

491
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,797
-Let us talk to Lord Shin!
-Please!

492
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,924
-How will we survive?
-Please let us meet him.

493
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,594
-Lord Shin!
-Please help us.

494
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,763
-There he is.
-This is outrageous.

495
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,307
I can't express how angry I am!

496
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,769
How do I keep on living
if my year's harvest goes to waste?

497
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,688
After all the work they put in,

498
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,148
our ancestors
must be rolling in their graves.

499
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,150
Calm down, everyone.

500
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,070
I am getting to the bottom of this,

501
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,781
so do not be anxious and wait.

502
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,540
During the delivery?

503
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,542
No, nothing happened.

504
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,795
Thank you.

505
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,263
The products were fine
when they left Seongsan Village

506
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,098
but arrived as fake goods.

507
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,143
This is quite a mystery.

508
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,652
Have you figured out
who uploaded the video?

509
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,031
It was from an illegal,
overseas IP address.

510
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,825
It seems someone deliberately did this.

511
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,328
<i>These tricky bastards.</i>

512
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,163

00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,849
Yun-a?

544
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,100
Yun-a!

545
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,946
Was I that bad?

546
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,672
What are you doing?

547
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,965
Don't stop me.

548
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,593
Starting today,
I'm going to become a strong man.

549
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,512
Suit yourself.

550
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,019
I'm so thirsty.

551
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:49,992
I bought that.

552
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,743
With my money.

553
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,375
A strong man must also
be able to handle his liquor.

554
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,569
You're trying so hard.

555
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,988
You're going to hurt yourself.

556
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,909
A strong man doesn't fear getting hurt.

557
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,039
How do you know what a strong man is like?

558
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,209
Getting buff and acting manly
won't make you one.

559
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,588
A truly strong man...

560
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,552
<i>has the firm will to withstand
any difficult situation</i>

561
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:56,266
<i>but also has the soft touch
to empathize with women.</i>

562
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,934
Are you hurt?

563
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:03,774
<i>He's like the perfect mix
of spicy rib stew and sweet ice cream.</i>

564
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,861
<i>He must be both tough and soft.</i>

565
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,571
-In other words...
-Firm and tender?

566
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,656
Exactly!

567
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,700
A man who writes you letters
with his buff arms

568
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,828
is a truly strong man, okay?

569
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,584
I see.

570
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:29,800
In that case, I'll grow muscles on one arm
and get sentimental with the other.

571
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,218
Pretty great, don't you think?

572
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,393
DEAR YUN-A

573
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,154
DEAR YOON-BOK

574
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,034
<i>Thank you for everything, Yoon-bok.</i>

575
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,996
<i>You don't know how happy I am
to have you by my side.</i>

576
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,473
What's this?

577
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,308
DEAR YOON-BOK

578
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,729
I swear

579
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,814
I went down the stairs,

580
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,401
folded the letter nicely,

581
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,195
and put it in the mailbox last night.

582
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,032
Where did it go?

583
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,368
Have you seen my letter, Hong-do?

584
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,078
What?

585
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,540
I remember writing a letter
and putting it beside me,

586
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,750
but it's gone.

587
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,346
Oh no!

588
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,432
What did you write in the letter?

589
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,850
-Me?
-Yeah.

590
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,730
I kept it short and simple
like a real man.

591
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,568
"I love you."

592
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:54,986
What?

593
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,075
No!

594
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,220
-Hong-do Kim.
-Yes?

595
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,305
-We need to hurry.
-What? Why?

596
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,100
-Just a moment.
-There's no time.

597
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,184
Come on!

598
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,563
-But I need to...
-Hurry.

599
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,002
YUN-A

600
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,214
<i>Which way is the grand ballroom?</i>

601
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,057
Hello.

602
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,143
Hello.

603
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,700
Is it true that your first fashion show
in Asia will be held in Korea?

604
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,160
Yes, it is.

605
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,664
Is there a confirmed date and location?

606
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,876
The date is yet to be confirmed,
but the location has been decided.

607
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,048
Camille's first fashion show
in Korea will be held in...

608
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,760
Seongsan Village.

609
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,261
-What?
-Seongsan Village?

610
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:56,316
Is there a reason why you chose
Seongsan Village in particular?

611
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,442
Well...

612
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,947
It's a perfect representation
of Camille as a brand,

613
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,157
which transcends tradition.

614
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,117
By the way,

615
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,827
this is Hong-do Kim.

616
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,456
She inspired me to host the show in Korea.

617
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,380
Hong-do Kim is a rising star at Camille
who will go on to work in Paris

618
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,674
after this show is over.

619
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,818
{\an8}CAMILLE PEGS DESIGNER KIM HONG-DO
AS A RISING STAR

620
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,780
What?

621
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,203
{\an8}CAMILLE PEGS DESIGNER KIM HONG-DO
AS A RISING STAR

622
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,913
What on earth is this?

623
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,456
What is it?

624
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,877
What's the matter, Hyang-gi?

625
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,129
What's going on?

626
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,131
-Is this real?
-What?

627
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,518
{\an8}CAMILLE PEGS DESIGNER KIM HONG-DO
AS A RISING STAR

628
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,693
{\an8}<i>It's a perfect representation
of Camille as a brand,</i>

629
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,153
<i>which transcends...</i>

630
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,671
This must be the last resort

631
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,715
she had mentioned.

632
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,177
On the bright side,
the fake news has simmered down.

633
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:49,971
But I can't help but wonder

634
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,516
how much Camille is involved in all this.

635
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,460
Yoon-bok!

636
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,799
Were you here for the press conference?

637
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,552
I wonder if she received
Lord Shin's permission.

638
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,179
Have you heard anything?

639
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,765
Master.

640
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,228
I must ask you something.

641
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,021
What is it?

642
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,190
By any chance,

643
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,361
is the dream you want to achieve
through this fashion show...

644
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,032
leaving for Paris?

645
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,203
You must've heard earlier.

646
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:57,914
It is.

647
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,002
It's my dream to become
a designer for Camille in Paris.

648
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,467
So after the show is held,

649
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,304
will you be leaving for Paris?

650
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,931
Of course.

651
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,600
There's no way
I'd say reject Madam Camille's offer.

652
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:24,941
Are you...

653
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,278
abandoning me?

654
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,449
Yoon-bok!

655
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,851
Here.

656
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,314
Call me.

657
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,276
If you are ever down
or would like to get fresh air...

658
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,156
call me at any time.

659
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,871
You seem a bit down. Are you okay?

660
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,293
Oh, did you read it?

661
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,087
The thing is...

662
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,548
I didn't write that.

663
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,469
Then again,

664
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,223
it's not like I don't feel that way.

665
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,682
Master.

666
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,478
This is it.

667
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,980
What?

668
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,024
Do not...

669
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,195
approach me any further.

670
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:54,090
{\an8}EPILOGUE

671
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,677
{\an8}I would like to buy these.

672
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,387
{\an8}In what size?

673
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,558
{\an8}Well, Master Kim's shoe size is...

674
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,819
{\an8}In a size this much smaller than mine.

675
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,904
{\an8}Just that much?

676
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,664
{\an8}Lord Shin has agreed to the fashion show.

677
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,834
{\an8}-Bravo!
-However, under one condition.

678
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,919
{\an8}-A condition?
<i>-What's going on, Yoon-bok?</i>

679
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,504
{\an8}Why are you suddenly avoiding me?

680
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,799
{\an8}<i>I cannot obey you,
even if you are my master.</i>

681
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,217
{\an8}<i>First day of undercover.</i>

682
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,802
{\an8}<i>Nothing suspicious yet.</i>

683
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,055
{\an8}<i>Did you see it?</i>

684
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,266
{\an8}How about we start discussing
a crucial matter between our families?

685
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,061
{\an8}Are you referring to Se-ryung
and Yoon-bok's marriage?

686
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,856
{\an8}<i>My fear has caused Master Kim pain.</i>

687
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,983
{\an8}<i>I love you.</i>

688
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,902
{\an8}MASTER KIM

689
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,111
{\an8}<i>Hey, Yoon-bok.</i>

690
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,073
{\an8}<i>What did you just say?</i>

691
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:05,161
