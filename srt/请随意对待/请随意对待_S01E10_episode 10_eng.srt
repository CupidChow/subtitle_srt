00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
   

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,280
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,710
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,190
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,240
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,910
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:29,420
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,020
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,020
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,740
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,530
   

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,450
   

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,370
Should we...

14
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,460
go home now?

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,610
Yes. Let us.

16
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,480
- Let us go. 
 - Shall we?

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,320
- You can go first. 
 - Okay.

18
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,850
   

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,280
♫  A midday dream in plenty of sunlight  ♫

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,210
♫  I'm starting to miss you  ♫

21
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:08,200
♫  I follow the wind and look for you  ♫

22
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,210
♫  When the stars show up in the dark sky  ♫

23
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,250
♫  It was so very beautiful  ♫

24
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,340
♫  I've been picturing it in the sky  ♫

25
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,590
♫  Like this, I meet you again, like it was meant to be  ♫

26
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,150
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

27
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,150
♫  I've been hoping for a long time  ♫

28
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,620
♫  I waited for you endlessly for many days  ♫

29
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,880
 I... 

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,870
 like you, Teacher. 

31
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,320
♫  Small but big-hearted  ♫

32
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,070
♫  When I listen to you  ♫

33
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:10,840
♫  I can hear loneliness and sadness  ♫

34
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,250
♫  When the stars in the black eyes set  ♫

35
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,200
♫  It broke my heart so much  ♫

36
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,100
♫  I tried holding them as hard as I could  ♫

37
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,390
♫  Like this, I meet you again, like it was meant to be  ♫

38
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:39,550
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

39
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,660
♫  Oh, I hope I stay with you  ♫

40
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,950
 Teacher, if it is all right, would you like to spend time with me tomorrow? 

41
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,960
Is he asking me out on a date?

42
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,250
 Sounds good. 

43
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:08,710
♫  As long as I can stay by your side  ♫

44
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,180
I have dark circles since I couldn't sleep a wink.

45
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,560
What do I do?

46
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,240
Teacher, I am here to pick you up.

47
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm sorry for making you wait.

49
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,490
You look very...

50
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,540
You look very beautiful.

51
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,030
What?

52
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,970
What should we do today?

53
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,760
Oh, I tried making plans for today.

54
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,500
   

55
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,300
Best places to visit...

56
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,760
   

57
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,360
 Date spots? 

58
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,940
Just follow my lead today.

59
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,080
Okay.

60
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,950
Let us go.

61
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,940
I stayed up all night thinking about what to do with you.

62
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,300
I thought spending time somewhere quiet would be nice.

63
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,650
You must be tired from working a lot.

64
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,410
Comfort your tired mind and body with me here.

65
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,390
This is so nice.

66
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,450
What's that?

67
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,750
Here.

68
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,230
You brought stuff like this, too?

69
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,280
This is my first date.

70
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,790
I did not want you to catch a cold because of my lack of preparation.

71
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,960
Is this your first date?

72
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,780
So, you've never dated anyone, then?

73
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,760
As the successor of the village,

74
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,780
I have been working on the retrieval of cultural heritages and events in the village.

75
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,800
I did not realize how nice it is to enjoy scenery with a loved one.

76
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,840
This is like heaven to me.

77
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,090
Come on...

78
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,520
I agree.

79
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Enjoying the scenery with you like this...

80
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,710
makes me feel so happy.

81
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,530
Gosh, Teacher.

82
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,080
Calm down. Calm down.

83
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,120
Stop getting excited.

84
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,780
This is so nice.

85
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,770
I heard grilled clams taste best by the ocean in winter.

86
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,660
I love grilled clams.

87
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,580
Hold on.

88
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,290
It'd be a crime to enjoy these without alcohol. Right?

89
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,900
Right, you can't drink.

90
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,680
Excuse me, we'll have a bottle of soju.

91
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,830
I cannot let you commit a sin.

92
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,880
Here you go.

93
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,500
Cheers.

94
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,280
You should eat now.

95
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,760
I ate most of them.

96
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,990
I'm full.

97
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,290
Here. Take it.

98
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,920
If so...

99
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
Are you okay?

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,620
Yoon Bok! That's... Stop!

101
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,750
Gosh! Yoon Bok!

102
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,950
Yoon Bok!

103
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,930
Wake up!

104
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,030
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,550
I shouldn't have drunk.

106
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,780
It is okay. I drank because I was careless.

107
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,330
But since you drank more than half a glass,

108
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,610
I woke up before the sunset.

109
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,650
If you take a boat there and approach the island,

110
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,450
you can see a beautiful sunset, apparently.

111
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,940
The last boat leaves at six. Let us go now.

112
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,670
Okay.

113
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,970
Island?

114
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,060
   

115
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,880
Looks like the boat stopped running.

116
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,070
How could this be?

117
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,780
   
        

118
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,580
- My apologies. 
 - No.

119
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,070
So what if we don't see the sunset?

120
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,310
We got to enjoy the lake and ate something tasty.

121
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,830
It's a bit disappointing,

122
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,060
but it was plenty of fun.

123
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,270
 He said Gamjjok has a burn mark on his arm. 

124
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,530
 Maybe he's not one of my co-workers. 

125
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,420
 The person I haven't checked is... 

126
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,410
Listen up! Today is a very important day.

127
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,860
Focus and be ready for it.

128
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,260
Okay.

129
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,280
Seriously...

130
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,250
You're a server. Why did you do that...

131
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,090
Here.

132
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,160
Follow me.

133
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,590
Wow, how nice.

134
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,470
You really are successful.

135
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,770
Here. Just get changed.

136
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,750
I'll have to make you baesuk again if you get sick. 
  (Cooked pear with ginger and honey water) 

137
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,990
I think the shirt is too big—

138
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,510
What are you looking at?

139
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,890
Huh?

140
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,920
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,330
I thought the shirt was too big.

142
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,760
I was wondering if you had anything smaller.

143
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,840
I wanted to ask you that...

144
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,220
Put this on.

145
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,410
 It's a bit disappointing, but... 

146
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,410
 It's a bit disappointing, but... 

147
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,710
The Teacher said it was okay,

148
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,480
but she must have been trying to be nice.

149
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,190
I made her disappointed.

150
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,480
What am I supposed to do?

151
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,450
I need to kneel and apologize now...

152
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,720
Teacher probably would not want that.

153
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,210
How am I supposed to ask for forgiveness?

154
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,750
   

155
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,640
 Teacher, I am sorry I could not let you enjoy everything I prepared today. 

156
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,300
 Could you forgive me for the mistakes I made? 

157
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,170
   

158
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,510
Why is she not checking my message?

159
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,790
By chance...

160
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,300
 Teacher, you keep getting messages. 

161
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,560
 Why will you not check them? 

162
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,470
 They're useless messages. 

163
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,870
 I should block them. 

164
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,590
   

165
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,850
Did Teacher block me?

166
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,520
There is no way. She would not have done that.

167
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,070
   

168
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,690
No, I was mistaken. I was mistaken.

169
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,830
There is no way she blocked me.

170
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,730
That makes no sense.

171
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,490
I was mistaken.

172
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,060
   

173
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,070
My goodness!

174
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,240
How could this happen?

175
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,500
My gosh.

176
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,120
 Yoon Bok, I had so much fun yesterday. 

177
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,050
 Let's do what we couldn't do yesterday some other time. 

178
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,620
Teacher.

179
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,250
Teacher.

180
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,130
Did you sleep well?

181
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,870
Hi, Yoon Bok.

182
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,890
Why did you come so early?

183
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,030
They say the early bird catches the worm.

184
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,180
I don't want worms.

185
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,440
Okay, okay. Let us go.

186
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,840
- Teacher. 
 - Yoon Bok.

187
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,900
It is apparently a bit cold today.

188
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,010
Oh, really?

189
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,040
Let me fix your clothes since it is cold.

190
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,140
Yoon Bok.

191
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,120
I-I'll leave now, then.

192
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,730
H-Have a nice day.

193
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,740
Hold on.

194
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,700
What was that just now?

195
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,640
By chance, are you two...

196
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,120
still awkward around each other?

197
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,200
What?

198
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,150
Please try to be friendly.

199
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,580
I feel so uncomfortable in the middle.

200
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,100
What are you saying?

201
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,660
I'm off.

202
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,220
Don't worry, buddy.

203
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,990
I'm always on your side.

204
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,280
Geez.

205
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,530
It is okay.

206
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,270
   

207
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,840
Yes, Ms. Camille.

208
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,770
We received the samples you sent.

209
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,060
I'll work hard on the parts you asked me to design.

210
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,990
 Teacher, it's almost lunchtime. 

211
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,220
 Do not skip meals and make sure to eat well. 

212
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,500
 Thank you. Yoon Bok, I hope you enjoy your lunch, too. 

213
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,100
 I miss you. 

214
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,270
   

215
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,430
Are you happy about something?

216
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,960
I'm very happy about something.

217
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,440
   

218
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,850
I will go home now, then.

219
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,800
Are you going home right on time?

220
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,960
Hey, hey!

221
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,700
See you tomorrow.

222
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,010
You little...

223
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,730
Gosh, I'm hungry.

224
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,140
Don't call my name.

225
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,750
   

226
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,430
   

227
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,530
   

228
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,230
Are you worried about something?

229
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,570
Can I use this, by chance? 
    

230
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,070
Of course. You get a dish that goes with your worry.

231
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,240
It's on the house.

232
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,230
My worry?

233
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,040
I...

234
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,770
can't tolerate injustice.

235
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,380
Pardon?

236
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,300
I witnessed a man threatening a woman recently.

237
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,180
I couldn't tolerate it at all, so...

238
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,230
That's how I got injured like this.

239
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,760
Gosh, you're so cool.

240
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,420
Just one second. I thought of a perfect dish for a warrior of justice like you.

241
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
You shouldn't worry that you restored justice. You have to celebrate it.

242
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,850
This is the most expensive item here.

243
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,090
Should we celebrate?

244
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,670
Artist Kim.

245
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,320
Why did you want to see me in a place like this?

246
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,720
This is a new famous restaurant, apparently.

247
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh, you were an artist.

248
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,010
"Strong Woman, Oh Yoon Ah"?

249
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,990
Gosh, I know this one.

250
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,420
This is the hottest webtoon right now.

251
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,350
Oh, really? Thank you.

252
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,570
I am the Oh Yoon Ah from the series.

253
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,640
So that makes me his muse.

254
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,080
Oh, really?

255
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,920
He made you look so pretty.

256
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,940
You're so talented.

257
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:04,510
I'd love a talented artist like you to make a logo for Cafe Smell.

258
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,780
Should I make one for you?

259
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,380
Gosh, really? Thank you.

260
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,480
You have a great personality, too.

261
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,080
Well, I will have a glass, too.

262
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,640
I will have the same.

263
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,490
That...

264
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,830
If you tell her your worry, she will recommend a dish that goes with it.

265
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,100
I have no such worries.

266
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,320
I will just have this.

267
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,830
There's other stuff on the menu, too.

268
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,420
By chance...

269
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,970
how much would it be with this?

270
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,530
Can I pay in installments?

271
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,770
Artist Kim.

272
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,340
Everything was on the house tonight.

273
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,160
On the house...

274
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Thank you. I'll be back.

275
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,350
My goodness. I got lost in my emotions

276
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,650
and came to pick her up without even asking her.

277
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,420
I have to contact her first.

278
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,440
What is that man...

279
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,880
Kim Hong Do!

280
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,320
How long has this been?

281
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,500
I missed you.

282
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,100
I...

283
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,030
It truly has been a long time.

284
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,680
What's this?

285
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,690
Yoon Bok.

286
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,400
Why would you hug me?

287
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,660
I was very surprised, too.

288
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,250
I did not think I would see you again here.

289
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,820
Whatever.

290
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,620
Hong Do, why won't you read my message?

291
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,840
Did you block me, by chance?

292
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,930
Could you stay blocked if you caught on?

293
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,280
I didn't realize because I was immature then.

294
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,950
But now I know.

295
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,700
Hong Do, you weren't fake. You were a gemstone.

296
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,330
So, I was thinking I'd get back with you.

297
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,640
Are you crazy—

298
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,780
- Leave. 
 - Why?

299
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,930
Is it because of him? Should we talk privately?

300
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,860
- How's tomorrow? 
 - Are you serious—

301
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,790
Teacher has a plan with me tomorrow.

302
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,280
- How about the day after? 
 - Sorry, but...

303
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,270
she has to do major cleaning then.

304
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,100
- How about the weekend? 
 - This weekend is...

305
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,270
the third anniversary since her brother became a webtoon artist.

306
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,300
She plans to have a pleasant time with her friends, including me.

307
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,000
I didn't ask you.

308
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,830
Why do you keep answering for her?

309
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,860
Are you her manager or something?

310
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,880
I am not her manager.

311
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,340
I am her boyfriend.

312
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,080
It's true. We're dating.

313
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,470
Kim Hong Do is an easy woman!

314
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,280
She has no issue holding random men's hands!

315
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,880
Teacher,

316
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,380
please look away for a moment.

317
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,700
   

318
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,590
   

319
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,910
   

320
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,740
She said she blocked you.

321
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,200
So, do not ever use your rude eyes

322
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,500
and foul mouth to look or speak to her.

323
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,370
He's so cool.

324
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,130
How could he be so handsome?

325
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,960
Is he really a human?

326
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,280
Let us go now.

327
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,580
 My Lady! 

328
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,020
My Lady! My Lady!

329
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,910
What is going on?

330
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,250
What is it?

331
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,520
- Young Master Yoon Bok? 
  - Let us go now 

332
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,040
   
 (Means "the cutest man") 

333
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,770
What are you doing?

334
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,070
What is this?

335
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,470
Watch this.

336
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,970
 She said she blocked you. 

337
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,040
 So do not ever use your rude eyes 

338
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,290
 and foul mouth... 

339
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,650
 to look or speak to her. 

340
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,050
 You even sent a wedding proposal. What kind of nonsense is this? 

341
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,430
How could you insult my family like this?

342
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,660
 If he keeps doing this, 

343
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,110
I will not let you have my daughter, even if you are the Woorim family.

344
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,470
No, I cannot do it!

345
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,770
Please calm down.

346
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,600
I will find out what happened.

347
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,250
Just wait a bit.

348
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,290
Do not just say it.

349
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,380
Take care of it properly.

350
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,960
 Otherwise, I will not just sit still anymore. 

351
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,580
What should I do about this?

352
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,470
How about some day drinking?

353
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,700
It's been so long since the two of us drank like this.

354
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,200
By the way, how come you haven't changed at all from 46 years ago?

355
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,260
You were sad about leaving me then.

356
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,140
Are you sad about your grandson who left now?

357
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,760
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

358
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,830
I just heard your conversation with that old man.

359
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,180
But we're no longer in the Joseon era.

360
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,520
Why do you decide your grandson's future?

361
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,810
My grandson has a duty to which he is committed.

362
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,770
Did you ever regret that you gave up everything for that duty?

363
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,930
Did you ever regret that you gave up everything for that duty?

364
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,480
A person with a duty has no other choices.

365
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,730
My son wanted to choose something else once.

366
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:39,050
He wanted to open up the village's gate. So I let him.

367
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,100
 But because of that decision, 

368
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,480
I ended up...

369
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,940
losing him.

370
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,630
That's why you've been locking up the village's gate.

371
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,690
By the way,

372
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,330
you know what?

373
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,440
I had a really hard time after you left me.

374
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,440
I cried for a long time, blaming you.

375
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,810
It's important to do your duty.

376
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:36,680
But would it be meaningful if you hurt the ones you love to commit to it?

377
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,190
No duty is more important than a person.

378
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,930
How nice.

379
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,310
What's gotten into you?

380
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,940
You suggested we have a drink together.

381
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,300
Although I'm obviously grateful you did.

382
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,980
Seeing Master being upset because of Young Master

383
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,950
made me crave alcohol.

384
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,670
I was reminded of my son, too.

385
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,190
What is the deal with children?

386
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,690
You worry about them whether you're with them or not.

387
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,180
Why are you talking as if you have a child?

388
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,410
I have a son and a daughter.

389
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,950
Pardon?

390
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,910
Have you been stuck in here without being able to see them?

391
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,160
Gosh, you must miss them a lot.

392
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,050
They're better off not seeing their pathetic father.

393
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,180
Let us drink.

394
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,380
By the way, that fellow seemed like an upright young man.

395
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,640
Why are the elders so angry about him?

396
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,910
The thing is...

397
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,910
I guess he has a girlfriend outside the village.

398
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,900
So...

399
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,580
she's the one causing a scandal with him?

400
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,120
S-Scandal...

401
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes.

402
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,600
 She said she blocked you. 

403
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,090
According to Yeojudaek, the video went viral in the village, too.

404
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,740
 And foul mouth... 

405
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,440
Do not worry about what they say about me in the village.

406
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,610
- But— 
 - Do you have any progress on...

407
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,690
catching Gamjjok?

408
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,330
We heard that a Chinese trafficking group came to Korea.

409
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,240
Lady Yi Bok left to find out about it.

410
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,690
Let me ask you about something.

411
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,490
Detective Shin, how did it go?

412
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,990
 They are indeed from China. 

413
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,590
 I confirmed that they checked into a hotel. 

414
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,250
They made a reservation at a restaurant.

415
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,860
But that restaurant was...

416
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,210
- Seongsan Hall? 
  - Yes. 

417
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,040
They must be trying to make a deal with Gamjjok.

418
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,090
Friday?

419
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,370
It will happen at Seongsan Hall this Friday.

420
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,620
This is my first event at Camille.

421
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,730
Make sure to come if you can.

422
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,450
Okay. I will be sure to be there.

423
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,110
Right, did you see that video, by chance?

424
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,320
Yes, I did.

425
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,750
You must've been surprised.

426
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,060
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

427
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,400
It is okay. I am okay as long as you are.

428
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,330
By the way, I have a question.

429
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,790
Yeah?

430
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,780
What is "The earth-shattering sejelnam"?

431
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,440
- Huh? 
 - Why am I earth-shattering?

432
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,500
That means...

433
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,860
That means you're so...

434
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,730
Never mind. I don't want to say it.

435
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,050
What is it, exactly? Please tell me.

436
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,850
No, I don't want to.

437
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,650
Please tell me.

438
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,440
Gosh, no. I can't.

439
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,070
- Teacher. 
 - It means you're cute!

440
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,680
You're earth-shatteringly cute.

441
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,670
That's what it means.

442
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,100
Pardon?

443
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,990
Am I cute?

444
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,380
Huh?

445
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,240
I am not cute at all. Seriously...

446
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,970
People call me mature and serious rather than cute.

447
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,000
What are you saying?

448
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:12,470
And you are way more earth-shattering to me.

449
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,410
Hey!

450
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,610
You're more earth-shattering.

451
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:20,480
No, you really are way more earth-shattering.

452
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,230
No, you are.

453
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,110
No, you are the most earth-shattering one.

454
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,640
No, I said!

455
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,800
You really could shatter the whole universe.

456
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,140
   

457
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,590
   

458
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
   

459
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,580
Don't worry about it, I said.

460
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,770
Sister, you cannot jump into danger alone.

461
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,210
The police will take care of it. Okay?

462
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,370
You really cannot.

463
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,900
Okay, okay. Go ahead and relax.

464
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,290
Sister.

465
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,740
   

466
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:59,040
I brought it as soon as it came from France.

467
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,000
Please keep it until the day of the fashion show when the retrieval will take place.

468
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,560
Thank you.

469
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,560
I will keep it safe in the village storage.

470
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,060
By the way, what is the consensus in the village these days?

471
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,930
 They must've opened up a lot since there will be a popup store. Right? 

472
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,390
To my surprise,

473
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:32,110
she seems to be getting along with the villagers.

474
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:36,020
I thought she was always cold. I'm surprised.

475
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,490
 Master. 

476
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,470
Did you wish to see me?

477
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,560
There is a precious treasure in the village.

478
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,460
Check everyone who enters the Seongsan Gate

479
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,500
so it does not end up in the thief's hands.

480
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,900
- No exception to any villagers, either. 
 - Yes, Master.

481
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,000
   

482
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,940
   

483
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,590
Travel safely.

484
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,190
Drive safely.

485
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,320
See you later.

486
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:55,230
   

487
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,980
All right.

488
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,910
Detective Kim and I will follow the Chinese from the hotel.

489
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,450
Detective Shin, wait at Seongsan Hall and take over.

490
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:08,270
Yes.

491
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,490
You two, be undercover near the restaurant

492
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,260
and radio me if you notice anything strange.

493
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,820
Detective Shin will call us when the deal starts, and we'll ambush. Okay?

494
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,940
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

495
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,490
All right.

496
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,140
There's a big event at the restaurant today.

497
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,770
Stay alert and study everything closely.

498
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,000
Check anyone with a black outfit and cap closer.

499
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,240
And let's all be careful.

500
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,200
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

501
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,950
   

502
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:49,680
   

503
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,070
Please look this way.

504
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,760
Please make a V shape.

505
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,890
Look here, please.

506
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,430
   

507
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,460
   

508
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,090
It's Camille!

509
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,760
   

510
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,980
Hey, get going.

511
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,080
Hey, Yoon Bok.

512
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,130
Teacher, are you on your way?

513
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,300
 Yes. 

514
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,270
I left 10 minutes ago.

515
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,450
I will meet you at the Seongsan Hall, then.

516
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,670
Teacher?

517
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,020
 Teacher. 

518
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,290
Just one moment, Yoon Bok.

519
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,350
Teacher.

520
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,240
Teacher!

521
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,130
 Teacher! 

522
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,490
   
 Teacher! 

523
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,680
Yoon Ah, where are you now?

524
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,560
That way.

525
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,210
Teacher.

526
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,480
Yoon Bok.

527
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,260
Teacher, are you okay?

528
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,590
I think she has a minor concussion.

529
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,550
We took an emergency measure. We should take her to the hospital now—

530
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,450
No, I need to go to Seoul.

531
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,100
You cannot. Let's go to the hospital first.

532
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,500
- Get treated first and— 
 - Thank you.

533
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,360
Teacher, do not be stubborn. You are injured.

534
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,370
Yoon Bok, the popup store is more important than the treatment.

535
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,350
What happened?

536
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:25,100
I don't know. It happened too quickly.

537
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,500
I got off because there was a collision.

538
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,220
I think someone hit me with a blunt weapon.

539
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,570
Who dared to do that?

540
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,110
They took something from the car.

541
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,660
 The shoes and... 

542
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,110
It looked like a box for a folding fan.

543
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,240
Fan?

544
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,490
   

545
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:01,980
 These are three pieces of cultural heritage to be returned from France. 

546
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,460
Is the cultural heritage from France being stored in Seongsan Village?

547
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,940
I think so.

548
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,610
Tell my grandfather and check on it.

549
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,070
Okay.

550
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,500
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

551
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:32,200
   

552
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,680
You still can't reach her?

553
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,320
   

554
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,620
Hong Do Kim, what happened?

555
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,140
 I'm sorry. I got into an accident on the way. 

556
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,780
 I'll be there as soon as possible. 

557
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,560
Accident?

558
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,150
Are you okay?

559
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,490
Yes, yes.

560
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,730
Okay.

561
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,190
She's on her way.

562
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,540
Hello!

563
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,640
Director, you came early.

564
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,280
I'm not early. Looks like the event was delayed.

565
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,230
Not at all. Should we have champagne, Director?

566
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,280
   

567
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,880
   

568
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,130
   

569
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,350
I was inspired by the pichohye in Seongsan Village.

570
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,230
What do you think?

571
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,850
These are...

572
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,580
Hong Do Kim, are you okay?

573
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,870
Yes, I'm okay.

574
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,530
Go to the hospital first.

575
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,260
Let us do that.

576
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,540
   

577
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,300
Pardon me.

578
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,200
How did it go?

579
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,480
   

580
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,020
The fan in the village was fake?

581
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,620
Okay.

582
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,610
 Going in now. 

583
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,150
- Did you see Ms. Camille? 
 - Yes, she said I can go.

584
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,260
I'll look for a hospital nearby.

585
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,150
   

586
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,210
Teacher, please wait a moment.

587
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,610
Okay.

588
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,780
   

589
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,750
 They're probably trying to make a deal with Gamjjok. 

590
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,990
Is there a problem?

591
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,500
Sister!

592
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,760
Sister, are you okay?

593
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,180
I think they're here to meet Gamjjok.

594
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,650
What's with them? Follow them.

595
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,180
Don't ever ambush them alone.

596
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,630
Okay.

597
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,480
   

598
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,820
Young Master.

599
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,700
I sent my guys. What happened?

600
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,310
What's going on?

601
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,180
He asked where the back door was.

602
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,140
I asked why, and he started running.

603
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,230
What are you talking about? Let go!

604
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,720
I caught him because he seemed suspicious.

605
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,180
Who are you?

606
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,420
Well, I'm with the police.

607
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,950
Just one second.

608
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,000
What? Are you with the Cultural Heritage Administration?

609
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,710
Yes, I'm a government worker. A civil servant.

610
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,040
   

611
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,390
Is this yours?

612
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,260
Yes, why?

613
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,570
It is a piece of cultural heritage that was stolen in Seongsan Village.

614
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,190
What are you talking about? It's not mine!

615
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,860
You said it was yours just now.

616
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,870
- No— 
 - Let's talk at the police station.

617
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,470
Huh? That's not mine!

618
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,800
That's not mine!

619
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,900
We need witness testimony. Please stop by the station when you can.

620
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Okay.

621
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,430
Wow, what's happening?

622
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,740
Could you explain the situation of your arrest again?

623
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,410
I finally decided to buy a pair of Camille shoes.

624
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,590
I put them down very briefly, but...

625
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,790
 Who's that? Hey! Hey! 

626
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,960
 Hey, you! Stop! 

627
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,780
 The owner happened to be leaving. 

628
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,480
So I asked him where the back door was.

629
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,370
But he suddenly jumped on me.

630
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:38,510
 Is that man really telling the truth? 

631
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,900
 Or is it a lie? 

632
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,410
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

633
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,110
You've been working so hard to catch Gamjjok.

634
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,600
But I ended up stealing your thunder.

635
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,140
Not at all. We can relax a bit, thanks to you.

636
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,960
They say it's always dark under the lamp.

637
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,770
Who would've thought Gamjjok has been using the Seongsan Hall to make deals?

638
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:13,930
I would've told you first if I had known.

639
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,470
- Are you done writing it? 
 - Yes.

640
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,570
I wrote down everything I saw and heard.

641
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,800
Okay. Please come to my desk for a moment.

642
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,230
Okay.

643
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,850
 The fact that Gamjjok has been making deals in Seongsan Hall 

644
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,400
 is something only the police have been assuming. 

645
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,960
 How is Joon Ho so sure about it? 

646
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:12,760
   

647
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:12,660


648
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:28,640
♫  Everything was you  ♫

649
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,790
♫  It was you in the end  ♫

650
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:38,890
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫

651
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,700
♫  It seems like a dream in  ♫

652
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,560
   

653
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,740
 What did you want to see me about? 

654
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:52,840
 I am considering supporting you to become Seongsan Village's leader. 

655
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,520
 Anyway, what will you do about Hong Do Kim? 

656
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,180
 - Will you have her keep coming in here? 
 - Not sure. 

657
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,320
 Young Master, we're closed. 

658
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:05,050
 I think the real Gamjjok is here in Seongsan Hall. 

659
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,250
 - Hong Do. 
 - Yes. 

660
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,500
 I didn't expect you to reach out first. 

661
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,760
 This is just the beginning. 

662
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,970
 Pardon? 

663
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:22,780
♫  You ended up in my arms as if it were meant to be  ♫
