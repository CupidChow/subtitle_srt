1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
   

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,080
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,740
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,160
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,030
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,760
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,180
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,100
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,050
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,490
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,440
   

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,480
   

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:06,940


14
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,590
   

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,330
   

16
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,950
   

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,040
Why is this...

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Here it is.

19
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,270
Yes.

20
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,250
 Yes, yes, yes. I'll be right there. 

21
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,900
Okay.

22
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,920
   

23
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,810
   

24
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,960
   

25
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,600
Why does Joon Ho have this?

26
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,420
 They say it's always dark under the lamp. 

27
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,150
 Who would've thought Gamjjok has been using 

28
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,500
 the Seongsan Hall to make deals? 

29
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,540
Could Joon Ho be...

30
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,900
Goodness, Joon Ho.

31
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,710
Hello, Chief Gatekeeper.

32
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,330
I heard you did something important.

33
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,170
We can sleep soundly now, thanks to you.

34
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,550
Well, of course. Have a look.

35
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,130
It's okay.

36
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,420
Why would I search you when you caught the thief?

37
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,370
Just go in.

38
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,060
Thank you, Chief Gatekeeper.

39
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,810
   

40
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,990
How many more times do I have to tell you to be careful?

41
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,190
How could you be so careless?

42
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,480
I keep forgetting because I am a lowly, uneducated bastard.

43
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,350
My apologies.

44
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,830
Just wait and see, sir.

45
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,930
We're just getting started.

46
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,500
You should have just left with the ingredients.

47
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,860
What do you want to see me for?

48
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,220
I heard you care about pottery more than anyone.

49
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,230
You probably are not showing me this to get it assessed.

50
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,990
No one would recognize its value

51
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,200
if I kept it since it does not suit my status.

52
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,890
I heard precious and valuable things are meant for certain people.

53
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,080
This lowly man thought this would suit you perfectly.

54
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,190
You want to give this to me?

55
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,910
Even a piece of pottery can shine with the rightful owner.

56
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:38,170
There is something else that needs the rightful owner.

57
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,580
I am considering supporting you to become

58
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,260
the Seongsan Village's leader.

59
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,040
You dare think of me that lowly to make such a vulgar suggestion?

60
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,470
I will pretend I did not hear it. Take this with you and leave.

61
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,280
What noise was that?

62
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,210
Why is this...

63
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,150
What are you doing?

64
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,680
I suppose I did not quite understand your taste.

65
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,070
W-What did you say?

66
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,180
A useless object should be discarded.

67
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,470
It is the same with people.

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,650
Call me anytime if you need something at a later date.

69
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,030
T-That little...

70
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,650
   

71
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,360
I can't believe Camille's first event in Korea

72
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,350
was ruined by such a scandalous event.

73
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,930
We can handle the product damage and financial loss,

74
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,650
but didn't the brand image get seriously damaged?

75
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,980
What can we do? It already happened.

76
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,960
We can have the popup event online.

77
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,680
We have to focus on the main event, the fashion show.

78
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,530
Anyway, what will you do with Hong Do Kim?

79
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,980
 Will you continue to have her work here? 

80
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,520
 Not sure. 

81
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,500
Hong Do Kim.

82
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,630
I told you to go and see a doctor and go home. Why did you come in?

83
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,480
Are you feeling okay?

84
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,030
Yes, I'm okay.

85
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,210
No, you aren't.

86
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,050
Hong Do Kim, go home because you won't be helpful here at all.

87
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,290
No, I can still help—

88
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,390
Go home. I'll call you when things get sorted out.

89
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,580
Teacher.

90
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,380
Where did you go in that condition?

91
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,370
I stopped by work briefly.

92
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,920
You look a bit drained.

93
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,560
Did something happen?

94
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,120
No.

95
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,360
Let me help you.

96
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,890
Be careful.

97
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,860
You would not have gotten injured if I did my job correctly.

98
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,200
My apologies.

99
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,130
What are you talking about? It's my fault.

100
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,910
If only I were more careful...

101
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,560
this wouldn't have happened.

102
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,780
No, please do not think that.

103
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,500
Just focus on your recovery.

104
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,100
I will let you rest, Teacher.

105
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,480
Because you wanted it so badly,

106
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,620
I barely managed to create your position somehow.

107
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,800
If you say you'd quit when we're about to get busy,

108
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,770
I'd be in a bind.

109
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,960
I am sorry.

110
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,900
Something more important came up that is more crucial than what I want to do.

111
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,950
 I will make sure not to have you face danger anymore, Teacher. 

112
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,870
There is neither a witness nor CCTV.

113
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,080
The black SUV Hong Do mentioned...

114
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,660
I don't know where it came from and went off to.

115
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,630
It's nowhere to be seen.

116
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,190
 The fact that the fan was hidden inside the shoe box on the way to Seoul 

117
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,450
 means someone hid it in advance in the village. 

118
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,550
 Does this mean there is an accomplice in the village? 

119
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,120
I need to go to the village to find out.

120
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,320
 I will free myself... 

121
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,000
 from preserving tradition, inheriting the village, 

122
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,820
 or getting married! 

123
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,810
 I will not do anything you planned for me. 

124
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,990
Are you finally done acting out?

125
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,950
How could I be when I never acted out?

126
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,350
I had to stop by to investigate the theft.

127
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,160
Please do not misunderstand me.

128
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,380
Did you confirm that the fan was authentic?

129
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,760
I confirmed as soon as I received it.

130
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,050
Except for when I said bye to the director and his employee,

131
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,150
I never left.

132
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,250
Looks like it was stolen then.

133
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,610
You told me to tighten the security as soon as the fan arrived.

134
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,350
So, we were extra thorough as well.

135
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,750
Was there another visitor from the outside that day?

136
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,730
No.

137
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,010
Joon Ho was the only one.

138
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Joon Ho?

139
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,960
You said you would live freely doing what you want to do.

140
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,620
Why are you so concerned about the investigation?

141
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,450
Someone I cherish was injured because of what happened in the village.

142
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,330
Do you mean the girl named Hong Do?

143
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,520
I want to protect her even if it means giving up everything.

144
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,720
This village is as precious to me as she is to you.

145
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,450
I will not care who you are doing this for.

146
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,570
Make sure to catch whoever is involved with the village.

147
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,190
   

148
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,370
Based on what Grandfather said,

149
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,410
the employee of the Cultural Heritage Admininstration is not the fan thief.

150
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,360
There has to be an accomplice, or the culprit is out there.

151
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,660
It must be someone who knows the interior layout of the Woorim House well.

152
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,300
Anything would be possible with Joon Ho.

153
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,190
But there is no evidence.

154
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,180
Should we ask Lady Yi Bok for help?

155
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,100
We need more than circumstantial evidence to mobilize the police.

156
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,450
Let us find conclusive evidence first.

157
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,870
Okay.

158
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,550
Senior.

159
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,290
Huh? Hong Do.

160
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,730
What are you up to?

161
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,970
I was throwing a plant away.

162
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,340
I bought it because it was supposed to bloom.

163
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,560
But it's only attracting bugs.

164
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,740
I got scammed.

165
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,270
This won't be helpful to the business at all.

166
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,220
Not even a tiny bit.

167
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,510
 Hong Do Kim, go home because you won't be helpful here at all. 

168
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,450
But how could you throw it away?

169
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,060
Isn't that too cruel?

170
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,640
You scared me. What's too cruel?

171
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,680
But still...

172
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,660
It's too sad to be abandoned.

173
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,620
A plant is a living thing, too.

174
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,470
I'm sure it didn't want to be this way, either.

175
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,660
What's wrong, Hong Do? Is something going on?

176
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,480
Never mind.

177
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,110
I'll take this with me.

178
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,030
She said she hurt her head.

179
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,130
She must've gotten hurt seriously.

180
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,790
   

181
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,690
 If you look at it, most of the patterns 

182
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,880
 are like this if you lift it like this. 

183
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,410
Sis, let's eat.

184
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,810
 Yes, that should work. That should work, but... 

185
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,300
 if you do it this way instead, 

186
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,230
 it's much easier to do. 

187
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,220
Who are you?

188
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,150
 I have never seen it again since I delivered it to him that day! 

189
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,440
 Geez! How frustrating. 

190
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,890
 Calm down. 

191
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,340
 Hey, calm down. 

192
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,130
 Detective, 

193
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:47,150
 we don't know if the box belongs to my client or not. Do we? 

194
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,640
   

195
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,510
How is Teacher doing?

196
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,750
See her for yourself.

197
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,480
Right.

198
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,910
You might want to hold your breath for a moment.

199
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,280
I'll open the door.

200
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,170
T-Teacher?

201
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,740
I heard protein helps you recover from a concussion.

202
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,340
Go ahead and eat.

203
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,700
Thank you, Yoon Bok.

204
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,960
W-What is wrong?

205
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,080
The beef is...

206
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,440
too tasty.

207
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,770
I don't have the right to eat something tasty.

208
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,920
W-What do you mean by that?

209
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,660
Everyone has the right to eat beef—

210
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,600
I couldn't save the plant, the popup event,

211
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,780
and I ruined Camille's image, too.

212
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,600
I couldn't even protect your dream of becoming a webtoon artist, either.

213
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,500
I wasn't able to protect anything.

214
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,490
- Pardon? 
 - Maybe...

215
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,850
my dream might be too ambitious for my ability.

216
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,460
I destroyed the mood just now, too, huh?

217
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,830
Didn't I?

218
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,010
Teacher, you know...

219
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,560
you saved me.

220
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,990
What?

221
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,120
I have been discouraged for a long time,

222
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,740
but you let me come out to the world and live. Did you forget?

223
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,210
You are capable of saving anything.

224
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,350
So, eat a lot and feel better.

225
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,890
Here you go.

226
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,640
It is hot. Take your time and eat slowly.

227
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,680
Thank you.

228
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,250
- It's tasty. 
 - It's hot.

229
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,140
 Teacher, you know you saved me. 

230
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,100
 You are capable of saving anything. 

231
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,560
   

232
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,980
You already got all these?

233
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,670
My physical strength, heart, time,

234
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,800
talent, devotion, and social skills.

235
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,070
I used all of it to the max and got them.

236
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,530
I already know you worked very hard.

237
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,470
You're keeping your promise, right?

238
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,870
- There is just one thing. 
 - What is it now?

239
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,330
You probably know, but there was an incident recently.

240
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,120
The village is feeling uneasy.

241
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,350
Are you saying no?

242
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:36,000
I am asking you to have tight security for the fashion show.

243
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,420
Good luck preparing for it.

244
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,390
Yes!

245
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,750
Thank you, Mr. Shin.

246
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,190
It probably wasn't an easy decision under the circumstances.

247
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,410
You worked hard trying to adjust to an unfamiliar environment.

248
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,140
It was really freaking hard.

249
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,990
But...

250
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,500
I got to think of you as I started adjusting.

251
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:11,200
I thought it must've been hard for you to adjust to living in Paris then.

252
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,510
I endured it...

253
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,180
because I had you then.

254
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,720
Really?

255
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,700
Tell me now, then.

256
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,960
Did you think of me at times...

257
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,470
after you came back here?

258
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,630
Well, sometimes?

259
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,420
Every once in a while?

260
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,200
I see...

261
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,380
Sometimes, every once in a while?

262
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,870
It's all in the past. Why do you ask about it?

263
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,730
Just because...

264
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,120
How was your marriage, by the way?

265
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,620
She was a good person.

266
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,940
Although she was gone too soon.

267
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,100
I wonder what would've happened if we made a different decision then.

268
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,000
Would we have walked this path every day together?

269
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,190
We might have been walking down

270
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,750
Champs-Élysées together, too.

271
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,850
That would've been nice, too.

272
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,610
Let's go now.

273
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,150
Frankie,

274
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,770
let's schedule it.

275
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,520
Gosh!

276
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,970
 Did you finally... 

277
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,100
reach an agreement with your ex?

278
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,450
Well done, Camille.

279
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,530
Call Hong Do Kim right now and...

280
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,350
No, I'll call her myself.

281
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,230
Send me her address.

282
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,400
 Ms. Camille. 

283
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,990
Here.

284
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,310
What a cozy place.

285
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,480
Please have a seat here.

286
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,110
Okay.

287
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,940
How are you feeling?

288
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,440
I'm okay.

289
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,290
Then, come to work early tomorrow.

290
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,640
- Pardon? 
 - The fashion show.

291
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,090
It's happening.

292
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,020
Really? My gosh.

293
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,900
You know how much I suffered to make this happen, right?

294
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,370
So, you'd better show off your talent. Okay?

295
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:13,050
This will be Camille's biggest challenge and change.

296
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,390
Let's combine Camille's craftsmanship and Korea's tradition

297
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,110
and create art that would excite the entire world.

298
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,520
You and me together.

299
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,560
Would I be able to do that?

300
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,500
I wonder if I'm tainting your image.

301
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,430
The pop-up event failed because of me, too.

302
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,310
Hong Do Kim.

303
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,470
How many times do you think I've been set back before I debuted?

304
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,980
How about after the debut?

305
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,080
How do you think it is now?

306
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,160
In every moment of life, endless setbacks

307
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,840
are awaiting you...

308
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,020
like a whole mountain range.

309
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,190
You'd continue to be set back, anyway.

310
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,730
It's up to you to decide if you'll collapse or get back up now.

311
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,330
If you collapse, I have no reason to be here.

312
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,570
Come and get it when you get back up.

313
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,430
Ms. Camille.

314
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,240
You know I can't wait long. Right?

315
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,860
Your desk will be cleared after tomorrow.

316
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,230
Yes.

317
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,210
As Yoon Bok said,

318
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,440
I can save anything.

319
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,010
I'll revive the flame of passion that's dying in me first.

320
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,860
I'm not trying to abandon you.

321
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm trying to free you and save you in a bigger and brighter world.

322
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,140
Because I'm reminded of myself whenever I see you.

323
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,150
So, let's be sure to survive together. Okay?

324
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,930
Got it?

325
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,890
The roots are deep and strong. It will not die.

326
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,280
It will overcome this hardship and grow into a stronger tree.

327
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,720
Will it really?

328
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,230
Yes.

329
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,940
It will revive for sure if you water it and care for it every day.

330
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,150
So, do not get tired and cheer up, Teacher.

331
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,430
Okay.

332
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,520
Yoon Bok.

333
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,560
What's with the car?

334
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,860
Get in.

335
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,370
I will take you to work to celebrate your recovery.

336
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,070
Thank you.

337
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,750
Of course.

338
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
I will close the door.

339
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,250
I-I will turn right.

340
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,300
I-I will turn left.

341
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,400
A speed bump!

342
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,110
Teacher!

343
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,570
Teacher, a-are you okay? Your neck...

344
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,310
Let's go. I don't want to be late.

345
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,990
Okay.

346
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,060
Thank you for driving me.

347
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,710
Do not mention it.

348
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,160
Teacher!

349
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,010
A famous doctor in Mt. Jiri gathered this ginseng extract drop by drop.

350
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,620
Drink it up and cheer up today.

351
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,860
Gosh, thank you. You shouldn't have.

352
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,170
I will take that.

353
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,080
Bitterness needs to be chased by sweetness.

354
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,760
Gosh, what's going on here?

355
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,560
It smells.

356
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,280
But I took a shower.

357
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,730
Do I still smell?

358
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,450
It smells sweet.

359
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,090
Gosh, how sweet.

360
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:19,330
How sweet. So very sweet.

361
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,320
I'm lonely.

362
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,620
I'll get going.

363
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,750
Good luck today.

364
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,740
Bye.

365
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,660
I wanted you to hang a more flattering photo.

366
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,740
Thank you.

367
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,630
I look forward to seeing your design.

368
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,210
Yes, Ma'am!

369
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,260
My daughter became so pretty.

370
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,030
Is Hong Hak doing well, too?

371
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,080
I miss them.

372
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,180
Where did he go?

373
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,130
   

374
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,190
   

375
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,560
That stuck-up old man left the village for a whole year.

376
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,840
What did he do in Paris, exactly?

377
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,300
 Please look into what Shin Soo Geun did in Paris when he was young. 

378
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,150
Young Master.

379
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,420
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

380
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,380
I am here to see you.

381
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,710
Me?

382
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,900
What is going on at this hour?

383
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,760
It is regarding Gamjjok.

384
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:58,550
I thought he only swapped out the cultural heritage with fakes,

385
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,070
but he swapped the culprit with a fake one, too.

386
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,490
But what does that have to do with me?

387
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,730
Because I think the real Gamjjok...

388
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,820
is here in Seongsan Hall.

389
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,760
You said it yourself.

390
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,620
That the deals have been made in Seongsan Hall all this time.

391
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,270
That is why I will be keeping my eyes peeled.

392
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,960
Look forward to it.

393
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:06,970
 I think the real Gamjjok is here in Seongsan Hall. 

394
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,180
Gosh, I'm stuck.

395
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,020
You ran away once.

396
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,450
How dare you come back to this place?

397
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,710
Why did I think of those lines just now?

398
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,510
This is why you need oxygen.

399
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,760
Gosh.

400
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,990
That kid hasn't changed.

401
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,490
By the way, why won't Hong Do come out?

402
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,620
It's hard to see her face.

403
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,630
What?

404
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,190
Sis.

405
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,450
What's banana milk doing here?

406
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,540
By chance...

407
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,040
did my fan leave it here?

408
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,110
Gosh, I'm too popular.

409
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,900
Thank you!

410
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,600
Dad used to get this for me whenever we went to a bathhouse.

411
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,950
Hey, don't bring him up.

412
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,490
Don't you know he took everything and ran away to survive on his own?

413
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,260
Why won't you even let me speak?

414
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,760
I wonder if he's staying healthy.

415
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,350
What are you doing here?

416
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,910
What are you throwing away?

417
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:14,170
May I have a look?

418
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,530
What's wrong, Young Master?

419
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,830
I think I was mistaken.

420
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,480
I am sorry.

421
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,870
- Yes. 
  - I did what you told me to do. 

422
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,040
 He knew I would be following him. 

423
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:50,850
 I acted hastily and gave him the upper hand. 

424
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,720
 There's only circumstantial evidence. 

425
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,480
 It will be okay. 

426
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,350
Hang in there, okay?

427
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:05,520
These bastards. I'll sue them for coercion.

428
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,470
Detective, they found evidence.

429
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,170
Really?

430
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,390
Over here, sir.

431
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:54,050
We found your vehicle and blunt weapon at your residence.

432
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,100
What are you talking about?

433
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,300
Blood was found on the blunt weapon that was used

434
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,360
and the DNA result will come out soon.

435
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,090
Stop dragging this out, and come clean. Okay?

436
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,700
I said it wasn't me!

437
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,190
All the circumstantial evidence is pointing at Joon Ho.

438
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,260
He is thorough enough to predict I would be following him,

439
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,900
but he must have missed something.

440
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,010
Let us walk through the case one more time.

441
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,320
Okay.

442
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,980
After your teacher got into the accident that day,

443
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,460
the fan was stolen and...

444
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,230
That's pretty.

445
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,820
It's pretty, but...

446
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,220
there's no story in the design.

447
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,550
Pardon?

448
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,880
Design without a story is like flat champagne.

449
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,930
Use the key chain's story and fix everything.

450
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,180
Okay. I'll give it another try.

451
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,720
I went to Seongsan Village and confirmed that the fan in the storage was fake.

452
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,960
That's when I arrived at Seongsan Hall

453
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,360
and saw the men who attempted to buy the fan run away.

454
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,980
What happened to the men who ran away?

455
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,490
The police chased them and saw them last in Chinatown in Incheon.

456
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:43,030
We can catch them and find out who they tried to make a deal with.

457
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,800
No, no. It still doesn't have a story.

458
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,000
It's no fun.

459
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,020
Redo it.

460
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,630
Okay.

461
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,890
 Is this the best you can do? 

462
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,800
Old, classic, romance.

463
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,450
Didn't you tell the press that that's the story of the key chain?

464
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,400
Get it together, Hong Do Kim!

465
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,910
I'll try it again.

466
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,190
Cheer up, Kim Hong Do.

467
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,970
Let's go!

468
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,750
I will go this way. You go that way.

469
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,320
Okay.

470
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,240
Try going that way this time.

471
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,760
Okay.

472
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,960
How did it go?

473
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,480
 The roots are deep and strong. It will not die. 

474
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,400
 It will overcome this hardship and grow into a stronger tree. 

475
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,330
Yoon Bok was right.

476
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,350
I will try again.

477
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,030
It's nice.

478
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,980
Pardon?

479
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,640
Make a sample using this.

480
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,350
Really? Did I pass?

481
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,560
Good luck.

482
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,350
This will be your debut work you won't forget until you die.

483
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,550
Thank you!

484
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,120
Start creating samples using this, Hong Do Kim.

485
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,730
Frankie, let's officially start promoting.

486
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,460
Contact the media companies and Hollywood celebrities.

487
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,050
Come up with a model list and hire the people we need.

488
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,040
Okay.

489
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,420
I searched through all the shopping centers,

490
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,900
but there was not even a trace.

491
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,940
You get caught if your tail is long.

492
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,220
If they noticed they were being chased,

493
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,530
they will make it more mysterious.

494
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,680
What should we do now?

495
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,060
We will expand our search in the area, focusing on the hotels tomorrow.

496
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,630
Okay.

497
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,790
- Hong Do Kim. 
 - Hello.

498
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,400
They will be assisting you with this fashion show.

499
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,100
Say hello.

500
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,930
Hello, I'm Moon Soo Hee.

501
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,010
I'm Ah Yeong. Nice to meet you.

502
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,460
I'm Kim Hong Do. I'm in your care.

503
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,840
 I will never be rude to my assistants. 

504
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,810
You're getting along so well already.

505
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:35,160
Start working now, then.

506
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,520
Shall we get started?

507
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,670
Have a seat. Have a seat.

508
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,150
 Ah Yeong. 

509
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,340
What happened to the document I requested earlier?

510
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,330
It's only been three hours since you asked.

511
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,160
You need it already?

512
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,820
It would've taken only an hour even if you took your time.

513
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,420
Listening to music makes me more productive.

514
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,260
I see.

515
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,380
Feel free to listen to it.

516
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,120
Instead, please get the document ready soon.

517
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,160
Okay, Senior.

518
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,530
Ah Yeong, did you get the fabric samples?

519
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,890
Pardon?

520
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,410
No.

521
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:03,030
You didn't give me the deadline.

522
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,810
I'll get them by tomorrow.

523
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,890
Did you want to see me?

524
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:29,040
Yes. I'd like to serve Korean food for the fashion show.

525
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,810
Should I contact Seongsan Hall since we worked with them last time?

526
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:40,160
Good. Meet with them today and get them to say yes.

527
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,800
Okay.

528
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,870
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

529
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,450
Sir.

530
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:50,410
I am desperately looking for my brother, whom I lost as a kid.

531
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,420
Please have another look.

532
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,290
Try the basement of the building next door.

533
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,400
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

534
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,450
Who are you?

535
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,730
I am looking for someone.

536
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,620
He's not here. Get out.

537
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,880
I said get out!

538
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,370
Shit...

539
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,020
Get out.

540
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,110
I'm sorry for making you come all the way here.

541
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,750
Not at all.

542
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,280
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

543
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,190
   

544
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,110
As I said over the phone,

545
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:54,200
we'd like Seongsan Hall to cater the fashion show.

546
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,490
We'll tell you the number of attendees as soon as we figure it out.

547
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,480
The menu is entirely up to you.

548
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,290
Sounds good.

549
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,280
I'll have a look and let you know.

550
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,380
Thank you.

551
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,440
By the way, what's your relationship with Young Master Yoon Bok?

552
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,420
Pardon?

553
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,450
You appeared close the last time I saw you.

554
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,200
Are you seeing each other?

555
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,330
Yes.

556
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,270
That's great.

557
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,760
- Excuse me for a second. 
 - Sure.

558
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:52,700
I have to take this call. I'll be right back.

559
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,310
What? Who came by?

560
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:18,320
Hey, you'd better stay put and hide in there.

561
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,810
It's Camille.

562
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,440
Why does he have so many Camille?

563
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,320
My gosh.

564
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,630
This is a rare, limited edition item.

565
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,960
Gosh, wow.

566
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,940
This is awesome. My goodness.

567
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,710
Gosh.

568
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,610
How many Camille coats does he have?

569
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:35,940


570
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,380
   

571
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,400
How did it go?

572
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,680
   

573
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,480
 - Hong Do. 
 - Yes. 

574
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,500
 Did you see it, by chance? 

575
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,590
 Pardon? 

576
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:27,800
 You are trying to make a profit by scheming with this woman! 

577
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,180
 You will have to step down as the village leader, too. 

578
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,090
 Your Excellency Lee! 

579
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,570
 Master! 

580
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,970
 Where are you? Come to the second floor. 

581
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,720
 Check the second floor. 

582
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,060
 Are you crazy? 

583
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:46,260
 I told you I would make sure to catch the thief. 

584
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,560
♫  It seems like a dream in one last  ♫
