1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
   

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,400
♫  I just looked at you smiling in front of me  ♫

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,710
♫  I want to hug you  ♫

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,020
    
 ♫  but I guess I'm scared  ♫

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,110
♫  As long as I have you, it’s all right  ♫

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,010
    
 ♫  It's like the spring day I don't want to part with  ♫

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,290
    
 ♫  Yes, if it’s just you, it’s all right  ♫

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,720
♫  It's love because you are more than anyone else  ♫

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,060
♫  In my world  ♫

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,980
    
 ♫  It's you who shines brightly  ♫

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,330
   

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,460
   

13
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,170
   

14
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,130
 Yoon Bok, is something wrong? 

15
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,110
 Please let me know. 

16
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,660
   

17
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,830
   

18
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,840
How's the patient?

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,900
The operation went well,

20
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,490
but we'll have to see if he regains consciousness. Well, then.

21
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:40,040


22
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,780
What if...

23
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,970
something happens to Joon Ho?

24
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,830
I'd feel...

25
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,050
so bad, then.

26
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,430
Do not worry so much.

27
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,370
I am sure he will wake up soon.

28
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,810
Shouldn't we tell Grandfather and Yeojudaek?

29
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,320
I will let them know right now.

30
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,800
Okay. I'll stay here.

31
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,310
Let me know if anything happens.

32
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,490
   

33
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,950
 Yoon Bok, is something wrong? Let me know 

34
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,180
 Teacher. 

35
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,200
I am sorry. I should have contacted you first.

36
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,030
Joon Ho was in an accident. I did not get a chance to talk to you.

37
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,730
Accident?

38
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,320
Yes.

39
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,960
I see.

40
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm okay.

41
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,970
I didn't wait that long.

42
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,480
You're okay, right?

43
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,470
Yes, I am okay.

44
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,860
Rest up for now.

45
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,680
You must've been busy all night.

46
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,870
Okay.

47
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,640
What? Joon Ho?

48
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,920
Who on earth did such a thing?

49
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
The police are looking for the suspect.

50
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,530
But I think Joon Ho wanted to tell me something that day.

51
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,710
 The key chain you had in your possession. 

52
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,250
 My father had been wearing that until he passed away. 

53
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,440
 By chance, if you— 

54
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,290
 I know nothing about it. 

55
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,070
 Joon Ho said he would meet with you just once. 

56
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:20,520
I suspect it had something to do with the incident.

57
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,670
Do you mean someone might have done that to keep him quiet?

58
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,170
I suspect someone is behind Joon Ho.

59
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,030
I thought everything was taken care of.

60
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,400
The fashion show is about to happen soon.

61
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,010
I am worried something might happen to the village again.

62
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,050
We cannot send back the people who are working hard again.

63
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,970
How about we strengthen security in the village

64
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,920
and wait for Joon Ho to wake up?

65
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,020
How about Yeojudaek? How is she?

66
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,820
Ma'am.

67
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,430
Lady...

68
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,610
what's going on?

69
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,290
Joon Ho.

70
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,410
Joon Ho.

71
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,760
Gosh, Joon Ho.

72
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,060
He'll be okay.

73
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,490
Let's wait together.

74
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,450
 If there is really someone behind Joon Ho, 

75
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,290
 who could that be? 

76
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,650
Did he give him the key chain, too?

77
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,990
   

78
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,600
Sir.

79
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,800
You wished to see me.

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,460
There will be a major event in the village soon. Strengthen security

81
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,880
and take extra care not to let the same thing happen again.

82
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,650
Yes, sir.

83
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,640
How flawless.

84
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,940
This is why I love fashion.

85
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,560
Two completely different cultures can harmonize and create a work of art.

86
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,990
When Soo Geun showed up in the middle of Paris

87
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,410
wearing the robe holding a baguette,

88
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,990
it felt exactly like this.

89
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,280
What was Grandfather like in Paris?

90
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,840
We were happy.

91
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,210
We went to a lot of nice places together, too.

92
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,540
He was my lover and best friend.

93
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,690
Until he got a letter from Seongsan Village.

94
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,290
A letter?

95
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,720
It told him to come back to the village.

96
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,980
I thought we'd stay together.

97
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,410
But he couldn't give up on the village.

98
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,250
I couldn't give up on my dream, either.

99
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,670
That's why we broke up.

100
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,650
You must have a lot of worries because of Yoon Bok.

101
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,420
"They broke up for the sake of each other's future."

102
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,380
That's how the story ended for old people like me.

103
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,980
You should confidently make a decision for yourself.

104
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,900
That way, you can get what you truly want.

105
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,350
 I thought we'd stay together. 

106
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,770
 But he couldn't give up on the village. 

107
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,770
 I couldn't give up on my dream, either. 

108
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,260
 That's why we broke up. 

109
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,790
 Do you have a moment? 

110
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,620
Yes, come on in.

111
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,570
Teacher, did you want to see me?

112
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,020
Yes, I wanted you to try the clothes on.

113
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,810
Is this your work?

114
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,730
It is very cool.

115
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,400
Would you like to try it on?

116
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,140
Yes.

117
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,760
 ­  

118
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,390
   

119
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,350
Yes, Sister.

120
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,940
 How is Joon Ho? 

121
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,130
 He's still the same. 

122
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,530
Was the suspect identified?

123
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,530
It's a newly hired prison guard. We can't identify him.

124
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,960
 I think he was taking orders from someone. 

125
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,470
I think someone was behind Joon Ho.

126
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,210
 We will have to wait for him to wake up for now. 

127
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,470
 Okay. 

128
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,350
Teacher.

129
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,260
It suits you well.

130
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,050
Can you move okay? Is it comfortable?

131
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,210
Yes, it is very comfortable.

132
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,340
Stay there.

133
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,550
 Who hired a hitman... 

134
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,550
 to do something so cruel to Joon Ho? 

135
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,940
 What was he trying to tell me? 

136
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,700
All done.

137
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,700
Yoon Bok.

138
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,340
Oh, yes. Are we done?

139
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,190
Yes.

140
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,510
   

141
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,640
The fashion show is coming up soon.

142
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,180
I need to leave afterward.

143
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,800
Things are hectic for you these days, too. Right?

144
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,470
Now that I've been living here,

145
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,960
I've noticed that...

146
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,190
you have a lot of things to worry about, including the village.

147
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,720
Yes.

148
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,550
You are right.

149
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,120
To be honest,

150
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,730
I have a lot of things to do right now.

151
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,830
But I promised to be with you, no matter what I do.

152
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,810
I will take care of everything before I leave.

153
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,700
But still.

154
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,140
Do not worry.

155
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,570
 To be with Teacher, 

156
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,960
 I need to take care of a lot of things quickly. 

157
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,940
   

158
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,560
   

159
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,350
What is this?

160
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,210
 Strengthen security in the village. 

161
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,310
 Opening up the village. 

162
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,630
 Expansion of the education for the villagers. 

163
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,740
 Exchanging traditional cultures. 

164
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,540
I wrote down the things I wanted to do for the villagers.

165
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,810
Let me read it and think about it.

166
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,250
And starting tomorrow, I will rejoin the police investigation team.

167
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,910
W-What did you say?

168
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,350
I need to catch the man who did that to Joon Ho right away.

169
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,660
Hong Do Kim,

170
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,150
here's the fashion show schedule.

171
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,770
Please deliver it to Mr. Shin.

172
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,540
Okay.

173
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,280
 I said you cannot! 

174
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,630
 You should... 

175
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,420
let the police take care of it.

176
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,200
I cannot wait that long.

177
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,230
When the fashion show ends,

178
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,760
I will leave for France with my teacher.

179
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,290
I am sorry, but that is my decision.

180
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,100
I will no longer...

181
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,690
force you to do things against your will.

182
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,880
I am planning to honor your decision.

183
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,760
But the man you are trying to catch is very dangerous and vicious.

184
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,630
If you act rashly like this,

185
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,860
you might end up getting hurt.

186
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,230
That is why I want to catch him.

187
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:53,420
I fear that man might put you and the village in grave danger.

188
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,000
I cannot leave the village worrying about that.

189
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
- I can take care of that myself. 
 - Grandfather.

190
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,080
You can leave now.

191
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:15,910
♫  You faded away with the old memories  ♫

192
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:23,050
♫  I try to erase you little by little slowly  ♫

193
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:31,410
♫  The last piece of you becomes tears  ♫

194
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,380
♫  I don't think it'll ever dry out  ♫

195
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,560
 By chance, what is your plan going forward? 

196
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
 I wonder. 

197
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,380
 I am not sure what I will be doing. 

198
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,180
 But I will be by your side, no matter what I do. 

199
00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:00,130
 Even if it might be on the other side of the planet. 

200
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,950
 Really? 

201
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,090
 Things are hectic for you these days, too. Right? 

202
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,780
 Now that I've been living here, 

203
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,290
 I've noticed that you have a lot of... 

204
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,670
 things to worry about, including the village. 

205
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,180
 I wish I could... 

206
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,010
 leave with Teacher. 

207
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,070
 But I keep worrying about the village. 

208
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,910
 What am I supposed to do? 

209
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,220
♫  I don't want to believe this is the end, but  ♫

210
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,300
   

211
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,550
 The fashion show is coming up soon. 

212
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,190
 I need to leave afterward. 

213
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,020
 I fear that man might put you and the village in grave danger. 

214
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,660
 I cannot leave the village worrying about that. 

215
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,620
We have the schedule for the fashion show.

216
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,060
Here you go.

217
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,440
   

218
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,880
 Would it be really okay to leave with Yoon Bok? 

219
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,160
 You should confidently make a decision for yourself. 

220
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,350
 That way, you can get what you truly want. 

221
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:40,570
♫  but now I'll let you go  ♫

222
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,910
Teacher.

223
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,600
Yoon Bok.

224
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,920
What are you doing here?

225
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,420
I was just...

226
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,460
walking a bit.

227
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,820
The night view is so pretty, especially tonight.

228
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,090
Yes, it's very beautiful.

229
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,800
Yoon Bok.

230
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,530
Yes.

231
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,310
Seongsan Village...

232
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,800
seems to be a very beautiful place.

233
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,990
People are very warmhearted, too.

234
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,730
Just like you.

235
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,920
Preserving the old way is very inconvenient,

236
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,470
but they've been taking pride in it, leading good lives.

237
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,900
If so...

238
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,330
it will have to be cherished and protected even more.

239
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,400
It's our precious cultural heritage that needs to be protected.

240
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,730
Yoon Bok,

241
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,410
I'll go to Paris by myself.

242
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,620
Pardon?

243
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,950
You should stay here.

244
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,450
What do you mean by that?

245
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,250
You should do your duties in your beloved village.

246
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
How could you...

247
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,730
I cannot.

248
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,660
I cannot do what you are asking me to do.

249
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,960
You know it, too.

250
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,570
That you need to stay here.

251
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,790
Can you really abandon everything here and leave?

252
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,870
Are you confident you'd be happy after doing that?

253
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,550
But...

254
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,020
to me...

255
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,770
nothing is more precious than you.

256
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,810
And I never...

257
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,770
want to lose the one I love again.

258
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,240
Yoon Bok...

259
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,280
I will be okay without you.

260
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,030
But this village can't be without you.

261
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:45,750
♫  But you aren't here anymore  ♫

262
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,370
I think I'd feel at peace if you stayed here.

263
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:56,120
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

264
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:03,800
Yoon Bok, thank you so much for always treating me with care.

265
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,950
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

266
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:18,940
♫  You disappeared like a mirage  ♫

267
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,710
♫  I think it's all coming to an end now  ♫

268
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,800
♫  You seem to be smiling for the last time  ♫

269
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:52,410
♫  I feel like I could embrace you if I extended my arms  ♫

270
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:58,660
♫  But you aren't here anymore  ♫

271
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:06,620
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

272
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,140
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

273
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,470
♫  Where are you?  ♫

274
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:19,880
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

275
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,280
 Can you really abandon everything here and leave? 

276
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,250
 Are you confident you'd be happy after doing that? 

277
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,990
♫  I wait for the night in tears  ♫

278
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,120
Teacher.

279
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:48,020
♫  When the darkness disappears and the sun rises again  ♫

280
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,380
Teacher.

281
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:04,160
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

282
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,440
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

283
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,060
♫  Where are you?  ♫

284
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:18,400
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

285
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,200
♫  You disappeared like a mirage  ♫

286
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:33,670
♫  I dream of being in your arms every day  ♫

287
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,590
   

288
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,150
 Finally, today is the day. 

289
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,720
Are you all done preparing for it?

290
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,600
Of course. Don't you know who I am?

291
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,510
I get to have a fashion show somewhere nice, thanks to my ex.

292
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,540
I'm happy.

293
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,170
Thank you.

294
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,130
Do not mention it.

295
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,250
Will you leave...

296
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,310
as soon as the fashion show ends?

297
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,980
I should.

298
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,530
Thinking about leaving makes me a bit sad.

299
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,200
I guess I already grew attached to the village.

300
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:46,440
Staying here let me understand why you wanted to protect this village so badly.

301
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,430
A lot of time has passed, and I have become so old,

302
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,160
but it is always heartbreaking to...

303
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,140
send away someone dear to me.

304
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,170
Make sure to keep doing your part.

305
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,470
Don't forget that safety always comes first.

306
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,620
Let's cheer up until the end.

307
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,890
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

308
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,420
All right.

309
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,370
One, two, three!

310
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,800
 Fighting! 

311
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,100
Hong Do.

312
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,120
Did you not get any sleep?

313
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,220
Your eyes look a bit puffy.

314
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,330
Wait.

315
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,010
You must be too busy to eat.

316
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,240
Eat this when your blood sugar drops while working.

317
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,540
Who asked you to give me stuff like this?

318
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,640
Stop doing unnecessary stuff.

319
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,590
Hong Do,

320
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,370
your father...

321
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,740
will do...

322
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,130
anything for you.

323
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,740
 ­  

324
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,340
Oh, my gosh, Reporter Kim.

325
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,420
You came early today, too.

326
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,770
- You look great. 
 - Thank you.

327
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,370
Gosh, look who's here.

328
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,530
   

329
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,480
Hello.

330
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,090
Everything's going well, right?

331
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,600
Make the jawline pop more.

332
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,370
Make the lips look as natural as possible.

333
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,700
Okay, got it.

334
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,000
Make sure the clothes are in order.

335
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,030
And check the fit when they put them on.

336
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,120
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

337
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,020
 I think I'd feel at peace if you stayed here. 

338
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:59,600
 Yoon Bok, thank you so much for always treating me with care. 

339
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,940
Sir.

340
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,590
Young Master.

341
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,650
What are you doing here?

342
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,040
You should go see the fashion show.

343
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,620
Yes, I will. I'll go in a bit.

344
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,220
You go ahead.

345
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,680
By chance, is Teacher...

346
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,340
She left earlier.

347
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,130
Okay. I will see you later, then.

348
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,010
Okay.

349
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,520
  ­ 

350
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,620
It's such an honor to enjoy the cultural heritage

351
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,170
return fashion show in Seongsan Village.

352
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,990
You made a meaningful decision to return to the cultural heritage.

353
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:18,030
I would like to thank the French government and embassy sincerely.

354
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,250
 ­  

355
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,740
You're a model, right? Come this way.

356
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,970
  ­ 

357
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,230
You've never modeled before.

358
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,700
Don't move while I apply the makeup.

359
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,080
   

360
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,260
   

361
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,530
Who are you?

362
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,350
Chase him!

363
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,840
- All done. 
 - Thank you.

364
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,630
Young Master.

365
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,300
What is going on?

366
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,540
He disappeared this way.

367
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,040
You look inside, and you look by the stairs. Hurry.

368
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,800
   

369
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,690
Who are you?

370
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,000
Director.

371
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,780
What are you doing here?

372
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,060
Ms. Kim Hong Do.

373
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,100
Huh? That key chain is...

374
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
I saw that here when I was a child.

375
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,610
Are you that man from back then?

376
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,040
Director.

377
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,120
Yoon Bok, have you seen Hong Do Kim?

378
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,630
She has been kidnapped.

379
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,320
Please tell Grandfather about this.

380
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,530
Kidnapped?

381
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,710
   

382
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,600
Geez, damn it.

383
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,650
 What are you doing? 

384
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,600
You saw my face, didn't you?

385
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,960
- What is with you? 
  - Geez, Joon Ho, that bastard. 

386
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,420
If only he did his job...

387
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,730
 Whatever. 

388
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,500
If you want to save your girlfriend,

389
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,180
bring me the jade box in the village storage.

390
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,650
How dare you...

391
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,460
If anything happens to Teacher, I will never forgive you.

392
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,830
Shut up and listen to me carefully.

393
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,110
You know what'll happen if you tell the police or media. Right?

394
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,300
 You'll never see Kim Hong Do again. 

395
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,710
I'll call you again. Just get the jade box ready.

396
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,000
   

397
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,520
She was kidnapped? What are you talking about?

398
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,420
That's just what I was told.

399
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,270
Shouldn't we report to the police now?

400
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:28,390
Let us wait to hear from Yoon Bok first.

401
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,780
What are you talking about?

402
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,070
My Hong Do was kidnapped?

403
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,770
What are you talking about right now?

404
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,200
   

405
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,070
What happened?

406
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,480
I think Director Lee Beom Gyo was the man behind Joon Ho.

407
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,410
Director Lee?

408
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,470
Why would he...

409
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,470
 He demanded the jade box in the village storage. 

410
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,900
 If we contact the police or media, 

411
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,690
he said he would hurt the Teacher.

412
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,220
I will look for him myself for now.

413
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,990
Please let the fashion show go well

414
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,370
 so no one outside finds out about it. 

415
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,520
All right.

416
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,940
Lee Beom Gyo?

417
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,770
Why would he kidnap Hong Do Kim?

418
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:27,190
We have been completely deceived by that man.

419
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,160
What are you doing? I said the Director is on vacation.

420
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,080
Did he not tell you where he went?

421
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,980
You can't do this!

422
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,060
What is Director Lee's home address?

423
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,730
Lee Beom Gyo!

424
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,450
That house is vacant.

425
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,020
I have not seen that family for a long time.

426
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,440
 There is something I have not told Teacher. 

427
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,770
 I should have... 

428
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,170
 told her that. 

429
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,390
Open the door!

430
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,120
Open the door, you bastards!

431
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,100
Help me!

432
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,960
   

433
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,010
 Bring the jade box to Incheon by midnight tonight. 

434
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,850
 You know what will happen if you do anything stupid. Right? 

435
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,550
   

436
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,620
Bring you what? The key chain?

437
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,830
Please help me.

438
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,850
You...

439
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,630
are asking me to give you the evidence?

440
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:07,960
To be honest, the Teacher was kidnapped.

441
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,830
What? You should've called the police—

442
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,680
He said he would hurt her if I notified the police or the media.

443
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,700
Is there anything I can do?

444
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,360
I wish I could ask Joon Ho.

445
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:30,560
But bringing the jade box would be our best bet now.

446
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,540
Sister.

447
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,240
- Thank you, Sister. 
 - Make sure to rescue Hong Do.

448
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,260
Camille's new face, Designer Kim Hong Do, isn't here today.

449
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,340
It won't be fun to show my hidden card so easily.

450
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,560
Hong Do Kim will make a grand entrance in Paris again.

451
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,320
So, come back then if you're still curious.

452
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,520
- Well, then... 
 - Okay, that's enough for today.

453
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,560
Yes, thank you so much for today, everyone.

454
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,630
See you at the next show.

455
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,860
Thank you.

456
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,270
It's my fault, sir.

457
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,060
It's all my fault.

458
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,410
What do you mean?

459
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,200
To be honest, I...

460
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,480
 Take your time seeing your son, and have a good chat. 

461
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,990
 Don't cry too much. 

462
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,130
   

463
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:12,470
I should cheer her up when she gets out.

464
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,640
What are you doing?

465
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,040
Help me! Spare me!

466
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,910
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

467
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,690
Spare me!

468
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,380
Spare me, Director. I'm sorry...

469
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:08,420
 He told me to steal the key chain if I wanted to save my daughter. 

470
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,610
I've been such a terrible father.

471
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:20,210
I did something stupid to save my daughter for once.

472
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:24,960
I had no idea this would happen to Hong Do.

473
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,700
I'm sorry, sir.

474
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,610
I know what it is like to be a parent.

475
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,050
But now,

476
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,740
saving your daughter is the priority.

477
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,060
Do you remember anything?

478
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,390
The place they took you to, their car, or anything.

479
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:51,220
I don't know where I was since my head was covered.

480
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,730
I'm sorry, sir.

481
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,870
Grandfather.

482
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,100
How did it go?

483
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,410
Give me the jade box.

484
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,230
I beg you.

485
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,140
I know it's shameless to ask this,

486
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,480
but please make sure to bring my daughter back.

487
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,770
Do not worry.

488
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,480
What is going on? My Joon Ho.

489
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,830
 Joon Ho! 

490
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,520
Ma'am.

491
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:41,340
My Lady.

492
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,650
I think Joon Ho woke up.

493
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,430
Joon Ho...

494
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,930
Are you okay?

495
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,130
 Come to Incheon Port. 

496
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,980
   

497
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:48,510
Yes, Young Master. He sent someone else as expected.

498
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,390
He did not bring Ms. Kim, either.

499
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,470
Thank you.

500
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,740
   

501
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,530
Yes, Sister.

502
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,520
 This is Joon Ho. 

503
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,620
 I know that man's hiding spot. 

504
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,640
You bastard!

505
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:47,030
Looks like Shin Yoon Bok isn't interested in saving you.

506
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,850
Where's Teacher?

507
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,560
I will not...

508
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:16,500
let any of you get away.

509
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:26,570


510
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:36,930
♫  I wander and extend my arms  ♫

511
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,610
♫  But you disappeared like the fog  ♫

512
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,860
♫  Where are you?  ♫

513
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:49,980
♫  There's no trace of you where you used to be  ♫

514
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:56,650
♫  You disappeared like a mirage  ♫

515
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:00,420
   

516
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,370
 What are you doing? 

517
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,360
 Don't blame me. 

518
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,900
 Help me! 

519
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:16,580
 That family always makes a big deal out of simple matters. 

520
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,380
 Yoon Bok!
