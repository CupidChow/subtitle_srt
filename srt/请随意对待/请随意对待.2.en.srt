00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:16,111
It's peak time right now!

184
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:20,181
- Let's go, I said!
- No, I want to stay longer. Stay longer!

185
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Hey, what are you doing?

186
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,740
I'm sorry.

187
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,900
<i>It's toward the back of room No. 5 on the VIP floor.</i>

188
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,270
- It's really happening today.
- Ji Won, let's go!

189
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,860
What did you say?

190
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,310
Let's go, I said!

191
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,330
No, it's the peak time right now!

192
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,190
Excuse me.

193
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,140
Excuse me.

194
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,680
Excuse me.

195
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,630
I'm sorry.

196
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,400
- Come here.
- Whoa!

197
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,250
- Hey!
- Pardon?

198
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,550
An eye for an eye,

199
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,850
a foot for a foot. Give me.

200
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,940
Pardon?

201
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,750
Give me your foot!

202
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,960
Hey, hey.

203
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,650
<i>A VIP?</i>

204
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,690
To say, "An eye for an eye, a foot for a foot,"

205
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,910
isn't the size difference too great?

206
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,840
W-Who are you?

207
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,300
What's with you? Are you his girlfriend?

208
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,720
I was just passing by.

209
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,480
I wanted to ignore it because I'm busy,

210
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,590
but my boss told me not to ignore injustice.

211
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,350
Shit.

212
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,120
Hey! B-Boss told you not to cause trouble.

213
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,960
Let's go!

214
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,750
I-I'll see you next time, okay?

215
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,020
- Are you okay?
- Well, yes.

216
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,240
I'll escort you back safely.

217
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,460
Don't get discouraged just because you're a weak man.

218
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,960
Strong woman.

219
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,600
Tell me your name, at least.

220
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,780
Kim Hong Hak!

221
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,170
What's with them?

222
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,780
Hey.

223
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,180
Yes?

224
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,790
- What?
- Shit.

225
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,980
Are you Gamjjok?

226
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,060
I don't know stuff like that.

227
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,850
Looks like you aren't one of them.

228
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,120
Remove this rope, will you?

229
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,790
What the heck? Who's this now?

230
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,190
Who are you?

231
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,680
Are you Gamjjok or Gamjjok's underlings?

232
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,810
Do you have no fear at all?

233
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,730
Who are you?

234
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,390
You are very rude people.

235
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,190
Are you the thief who steals treasures?

236
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,840
I take pride in being a gangster.

237
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,430
We use our fists, but we don't steal.

238
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,810
Young Master!

239
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,210
Yoon Ah!

240
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,490
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah!

241
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,390
Those bastards. Screens, ceramics, and the Buddha statue.

242
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,440
They stole a variety of things.

243
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,880
By the way, that man is...

244
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,380
He was tied up inside, but he does not appear to be Gamjjok.

245
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,860
I will interrogate him.

246
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,330
Please look for the men who ran away.

247
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,710
Okay. We'll find them quickly if we go after their gang.

248
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,430
Are you okay?

249
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,730
Yes, do not worry.

250
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,360
Where do you live? I will take you there.

251
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,120
I don't know about Gamjjok or whatever.

252
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,590
I just moved stuff because they said it'd pay well.

253
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,050
And my client gave this to me.

254
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,830
Who is that client?

255
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,540
I don't know.

256
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,070
I just get texts from a burner phone. There's no way to know.

257
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,160
Anyway, I'm innocent.

258
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,190
It says on my face.

259
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,280
"Innocent person. A good citizen."

260
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,890
Why were you held hostage if you're so innocent?

261
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,630
The thing is...

262
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,460
I saw something...

263
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,730
I wasn't supposed to see.

264
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,070
[Danwon Kim Hong Do's Cultural Landscape in Four Seasons is stolen! Is it Gamjjok's doing?]

265
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,110
[Woorim]

266
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,650
What is wrong?

267
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,830
Have you seen this man's face?

268
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,510
Get home safely.

269
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,130
Thank you.

270
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,650
Let us go.

271
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,420
Who are you?

272
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,730
Are you okay?

273
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,880
I...

274
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,020
remember.

275
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,840
Leave.

276
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,990
Yes, sir.

277
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,310
<i>That man had a...</i>

278
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,590
burnt mark on his arm.

279
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,820
You broke open the piggy bank to go to a club?

280
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,840
Are you out of your mind?

281
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,050
You make it sound like only I went there.

282
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,810
We ran into each other there.

283
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,370
I went there for free.

284
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,600
And why would you bring Yoon Bok there?

285
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,410
Seriously, this is so unfair.

286
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,320
Yoon Bok suggested we go there, okay?

287
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,110
Hey, come up with a more believable lie.

288
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,610
Yoon Bok wanted to go clubbing?

289
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,550
Who would believe that?

290
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,180
This is no good.

291
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,610
Let's go.

292
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,560
- Where?
- Let's have a confrontation with Yoon Bok.

293
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,210
Hey.

294
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,750
It's fine.

295
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,300
Don't overreact.

296
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,790
What did you say just now?

297
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,300
Are you telling me to care for this stranger?

298
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,270
He is hiding due to a situation.

299
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,800
Please let him hide temporarily.

300
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,060
How could I trust someone from the outside world?

301
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,520
And Young Master, I'm a sensitive woman.

302
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,650
I cannot sleep even when an ant goes by.

303
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:40,000
I heard the singer you like is performing nearby this fall.

304
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,370
You mean my Myeong Joon?

305
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:46,040
I heard music is way more touching live.

306
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,200
You mean that precious ticket...

307
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:58,240
I think I could try to be slightly less sensitive.

308
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,750
Does he know how to do anything?

309
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:08,170
Make sure no one ever notices him. And...

310
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,810
let me know if there's anything suspicious.

311
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,000
This is the key to the village storage.

312
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,400
My father always carried it when he was alive.

313
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,610
[Woorim]

314
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,460
Yoon Bok, the Seongsan Gate opens widely for the first time today.

315
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Remember that our village was reborn today.

316
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,860
We should have a birthday party since it was reborn.

317
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,070
Yes, we should.

318
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,660
I need to leave to tend to something now.

319
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,370
So let's have a party after I return.

320
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,250
Aigoo! My goodness!

321
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,100
Master!

322
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,170
I heard the key chain was destroyed by the fire then.

323
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,040
How did it end up in Gamjjok's hand?

324
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,530
I am not sure. Let us start finding that out.

325
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,160
Grandfather would be worried.

326
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,010
Keep this only between us for now.

327
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,330
Okay.

328
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,400
I heard Yoon Bok recovered more treasure.

329
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,560
Wow! He is talented in finding precious things like you.

330
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,220
You must be so proud of him.

331
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,830
You've been achieving great things with the country through generations.

332
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:35,450
I should request the president to reward you handsomely.

333
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,820
It happened because we couldn't protect what we were supposed to. It makes no sense.

334
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,570
You have a strong sense of duty.

335
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,770
By the way, why did Yoon Bok go back to Seoul?

336
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,880
He is determined to capture Gamjjok.

337
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,530
How could I tell him not to?

338
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,300
What if something happens to him?

339
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,300
I still clearly remember his father's tragic death.

340
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,440
My apologies.

341
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,700
I was just worried about your only relative.

342

Hello, Chief Gatekeeper.

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,880
Joon Ho, you little!

344
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,810
Master Shin Soo Geun told you to dress properly when you visit the village.

345
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,670
My apologies. I came in a hurry since I ran out of ingredients.

346
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,140
I will take the ingredients and leave immediately.

347
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,870
Let him in.

348
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,210
Thank you.

[Seongsan Hall]

350
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,290
Yes, yes. Bring it here.

352
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,030
Are you okay?

353
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,010
Joon Ho, how dare you!

354
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,290
Are you hurt at all?

355
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,890
I am okay. I was just a bit surprised.

356
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,260
Are you out of your mind?

357
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,110
I told you to slow down when you enter the village in a car.

358
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,690
You almost injured another lady from a prominent family!

359
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,750
You little!

360
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:04,100
Did you dare to make that precious child sick?

361
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,270
You left the village without a word when you were young.

362
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,740
I did not want you to set your foot in here again.

363
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,520
But I gave you another chance since your mother begged desperately.

364
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,550
How come you are never careful and cause danger like this again?

365
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,520
Sir, please forgive him.

366
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,780
Why are you just standing there?

367
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,990
Beg for forgiveness right now.

368
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,100
My apologies.

369
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,360
If this happens again,

370
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,620
I will not let you bring a car in here again.

371
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,040
Keep that in mind, and be careful.

372
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,750
Okay.

373
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,540
Let us go, Se Ryeong.

374
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,370
The old man hasn't changed.

375
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:05,280
You little. How dare you talk about him like that?

376
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,430
What are you doing here?

377
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,450
I came for a reason, obviously.

378
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,180
My work life has been very interesting, thanks to you.

379
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,320
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Kim Hong Do.

380
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,250
So, please...

381
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,690
quit your job. I'm begging you.

382
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,860
What?

383
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,680
I feel uncomfortable because of you, and I can't work.

384
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,590
I apologized because you told me to.

385
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,320
You should do me a favor, too.

386
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Wow, you never fail to exceed my imagination.

387
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,430
I'm kneeling even though you didn't ask me to.

388
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,580
So, please get out of my face, Kim Hong Do!

389
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,150
You leave instead.

390
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,170
Hey, Kim Hong Do!

391
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,790
Let me make this clear.

392
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,260
You quit if you feel uncomfortable at work.

393
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,670
I'll never quit.

394
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,590
Let go of me if you understand. Let go!

395
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,650
I said get lost, Kim Hong Do!

396
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,590
How dare you touch her?

397
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,460
You are using violence on your former lover?

398
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,180
Are you not ashamed?

399
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,250
What? How dare you butt in?

400
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,500
It's him.

401
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,940
He's the one who helped you then, right?

402
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,520
Let's talk later.

403
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,810
What's with you?

404
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,060
What's your relationship?

405
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,310
You treated me like trash.

406
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,020
You've been seeing this bastard, too.

407
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,600
It's not like that, okay?

408
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,750
Do not ever dare to lay your hand on her.

409
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,580
Okay, okay! Let go, let go!

410
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,760
You do not have any manners.

411
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Keep this in mind.

412
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,660
Manners make a person.

413
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,490
Shit.

414
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,160
Teacher, are you okay?

415
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,690
<i>It's Yoon Bok again.</i>

416
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,270
<i>Whenever I feel small and tired...</i>

417
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,090
<i>Are you okay?</i>

418
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:11,180
<i>Yoon Bok shows up in front of me.</i>

419
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,950
Thank you for helping me. I'll leave.

420
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,280
I will accompany you back home.

421
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,150
No, it's okay. I'll go on my own.

422
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,560
No.

423
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,850
Impolite people like him are everywhere at night.

424
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,390
I cannot let you leave alone as your student.

425
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,330
- I'm okay, I said.
- But-

426
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,790
I said I'm okay.

427
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,990
I said I'm okay. Why do you keep insisting on seeing me off?

428
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,910
What are you? My bodyguard or something?

429
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,120
Why do you keep showing up and helping me?

430
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,860
I said I'll go on my own.

431
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,030
I can go myself.

432
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,460
<i>Yoon Bok, you don't have to be embarrassed for being a bit different.</i>

433
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,670
<i>Whether people like it or not,</i>

434
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,710
<i>you're plenty cool as you are.</i>

435
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,970
<i>I came out in the world confidently, thanks to her. But why...</i>

436
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:56,800
is she avoiding me so much?

437
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,840
<i>By chance...</i>

438
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,920
It's been so long.

439
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,600
Has it been seven years?

440
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,010
Yes.

441
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,630
L-Long time, no see.

442
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,080
<i>I dared to approach her with a lie and...</i>

443
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,870
<i>I wanted to give you these flowers.</i>

444
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,510
<i>It is my gratitude as your student. Please take it.</i>

445
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,200
<i>Gosh, seriously.</i>

446
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,280
<i>Did you sleep soundly last night, Teacher?</i>

447
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,180
<i>I kept showing up out of nowhere and made her nervous.</i>

448
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,600
<i>I'm okay, I said.</i>

449
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,820
<i>I said I'm okay. Why do you keep insisting on seeing me off?</i>

450
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,800
<i>What are you? My bodyguard or something?</i>

451
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,510
<i>Why do you keep showing up and helping me?</i>

452
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,690
<i>I dared to make her feel uncomfortable and angry.</i>

453
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,340
H-How foolish...

454
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,290
I dared to be so impolite to her.

455
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,610
Was I too harsh with him?

456
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,950
Gosh, you scared me!

457
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,680
Yoon Bok.

458
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,880
What are you doing here?

459
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,730
Get up right now.

460
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,290
I cannot do that.

461
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,680
I committed an unforgivable sin to you.

462
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,740
I cannot get up...

463
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,310
until you forgive me.

464
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,890
Hey, what are you talking about?

465
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,270
I understand why you have been avoiding me.

466
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,310
What?

467
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,920
"Teacher and father are united in heart."

468
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,040
Teachers are like the king and father.

469
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,450
One is obligated to be polite to them

470
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,130
and never cross the line.

471
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,870
But this foolish student dared to cross that line.

472
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:05,690
You must have been so sad and disappointed,

473
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,510
but I failed to understand that.

474
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:12,730
Would you forgive my impoliteness?

475
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,560
Hey, what are you doing?

476
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,630
It's not like that. Get up now. Hurry.

477
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,030
I cannot do that. Until you forgive me...

478
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,340
Get up, Yoon Bok! Right now!

479
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:48,210
Looks like you're mistaken about something.

480
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,890
I didn't avoid you because you did something wrong.

481
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,230
If so,

482
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,080
do you mind if I ask you...

483
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,070
why you avoided me?

484
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,400
T-That's...

485
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,560
not because you've been rude.

486
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,160
It's because I was embarrassed.

487
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,890
Pardon?

488
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:19,540
Hey, I got drunk and did stuff like this in front of you.

489
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,300
How could I keep my head up in front of you?

490
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,200
As you said, I'm your teacher,

491
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,070
but I embarrassed myself in front of you.

492
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:32,530
I embarrassed myself in front of you again earlier, too.

493
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,490
That's why...

494
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,430
It is okay.

495
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,700
What?

496
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,520
You do not have to be embarrassed of yourself.

497
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,750
Whether people like it or not, no matter what they think,

498
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,580
you are plenty cool as you are.

499
00:48:54,570 --> 00:49:00,620
I will pay more attention to your heart from now on.

500
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,090
So...

501
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,710
please do not avoid me.

502
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,480
Okay, I won't.

503
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,160
I'll never avoid you from now on.

504
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,720
I finally...

505
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,820
I finally feel relieved.

506
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,320
- Let's go.
- Pardon?

507
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,800
We're neighbors now.

508
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,170
But I haven't welcomed you since I've been avoiding you.

509
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,410
It's a bit late, but let's celebrate now.

510
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,970
This is a very rare opportunity, okay?

511
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:58,430
I'm famous for being thrifty in this neighborhood.

512
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:02,060
I'll open my wallet only tonight. Let me know if you're craving anything.

513
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,130
But...

514
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,750
everything must be closed since it is late now.

515
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,680
There's one place.

516
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,970
My regular spot that's open for 24 hours.

517
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,970
Are you not spending too much because of me?

518
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,270
It's not like that, but...

519
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,140
you aren't uncomfortable eating with me, right?

520
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,400
Not at all.

521
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,870
Why are you sitting there, then?

522
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:40,110
As I said, a teacher is like a king and father.

523
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,110
I cannot dare to share a table with you.

524
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,360
But Yoon Bok, this is not Seongsan Village.

525
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,400
- But-
- You're making me uncomfortable, okay?

526
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,430
My neck hurts because I have to keep turning around.

527
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:57,570
And didn't you say you'd pay attention to my heart earlier?

528
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,220
I-If you feel that uncomfortable...

529
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,320
I will move.

530
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,780
Okay.

531
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:36,740
By the way, you seem to have changed.

532
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,940
In what regard?

533
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,150
You somehow...

534
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,430
became more confident.

535
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,960
You look like a very confident scholar.

536
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,080
It is thanks to you.

537
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,210
You know how to flatter people, too. You changed.

538
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:08,500
I ran away then because I felt burdened and afraid then.

539
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,480
But I mustered up the courage to go back, thanks to you.

540
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,900
I remembered your teaching every day.

541
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,050
In front of fear and what I believed to be right,

542
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,740
