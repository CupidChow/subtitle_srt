183
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:43,997
Tell my mom or sister to bring it, then.

184
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:47,257
I will not eat the medicine you give me.

185
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,377
Aigoo, seriously...

186
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:56,387
How dare you shed tears?

187
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:58,607
Get up and take the medicine now.

188
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:00,187
I do not want to.

189
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:03,667
Where did my mother and sister go?

190
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:07,237
Why are they not visiting me when I am sick?

191
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:13,147
I said your mother left the village with your sister.

192
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:14,597
Listen carefully.

193
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:18,757
You are the eldest son of the Woorim Shin family, who will lead this village.

194
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:22,297
So don't get consumed by personal feelings.

195
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:26,827
Do not waste your emotions waiting for the ones who will not return, either.

196
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:29,957
You can only trust yourself in this world.

197
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,017
So overcome it by yourself.

198
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:35,107
You should leave, Yeojudaek.

199
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,437
Gosh!

200
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,227
Hi.

201
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,087
Has he always been like that?

202
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,197
- What did you say?
- I mean, Yoon Bok.

203
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:31,727
He's always been drawing lines with people since high school,

204
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:35,207
so we called him Seon* Yoon Bok, not Shin Yoon Bok.
(Means "line")

205
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:39,707
Who are you that you dare to call him by his name?

206
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,917
I'm Hong Hak.

207
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,267
Kim Hong Hak.

208
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,037
<i>- Are you okay?
- Well...</i>

209
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,517
<i>Yes.</i>

210
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:52,867
That weak man.

211
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:55,127
Yes, that's right.

212
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:57,937
You were Yoon Bok's bodyguard.

213
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:00,837
I'm Yoon Bok's best friend.

214
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:05,737
I am not sure how close you are to Young Master,

215
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:08,817
but there is a reason why he is drawing the line.

216
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,747
So, do not speak rudely of him.

217
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,847
H-Hold on.

218
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:17,427
I haven't come up with a title yet.

219
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:19,077
Well...

220
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:23,127
Your name... What's your name...

221
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:31,257
E-Excuse me.

222
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:36,447
I can just ask Yoon Bok.

223
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:55,567
Hey, bro!

224
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,037
It's too early to sleep already.

225
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,377
Get up for a second.

226
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:03,687
You know, your bodyguard...

227
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,437
What's her name-

228
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:13,107
Hot.

229
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:15,957
Hey, Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok!

230
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,817
Scallops are only 5,000 won!

231
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,427
Thank you.

232
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:22,287
Here you go. Enjoy.

233
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,487
Scallops are only 5,000 won.

234
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,997
What is it?

235
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,577
Noona...

236
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:29,907
Someone's very sick.

237
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,647
Sick? What's wrong?

238
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:34,097
<i>Not me. It's Yoon Bok.</i>

239
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:36,397
Yoon Bok? Yoon Bok is sick?

240
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,177
Looks like he got the flu.

241
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,097
He's totally boiling...

242
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,667
Aren't you buying?

243
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,367
Hang up for now.

244
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,227
Sir, I will have abalone, too.

245
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,667
Scallops and abalone?

246
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,277
Okay, then!

247
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:50,207
- Scallops are...
- I want a lot. A lot.

248
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,407
Fifty thousand won.

249
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,447
H-Hello?

250
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,747
[Strengthening security was futile!]

251
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,667
[List of items]

252
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,867
Why do I feel so heavy?

253
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,957
Who is it?

254
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,597
<i>Yoon Bok, it's me.</i>

255
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:00,087
Teacher?

256
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:01,587
<i>Yes.</i>

257
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:12,187
You came all the way to my place to give me this?

258
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,157
I felt bad since I heard you were sick.

259
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:19,277
You caught a cold because of me.

260
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,307
Not at all.

261
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:24,747
It happened because I did not take care of myself. Do not worry.

262
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:27,447
Okay. I won't worry.

263
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:31,247
Instead, let's switch seats.

264
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,677
But a teacher is like a king and-

265
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,477
I know, I know. "A teacher is like a king and father."

266
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:42,727
It's an order from your teacher, who's like a king and father.

267
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,627
Will you not listen to me?

268
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,157
If so...

269
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:52,817
I will go there.

270
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:55,177
Okay.

271
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:09,327
Will you feel comfortable sitting here?

272
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,097
No.

273
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,297
Here. This is good.

274
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,817
Have a seat.

275
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,157
Okay.

276
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:27,547
Eat a lot and get well soon.

277
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,467
You should eat with me.

278
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,837
No, no. I made it for you.

279
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:34,617
No.

280
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,757
Here you go.

281
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,277
I said I'm okay.

282
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:45,527
Let us enjoy it together.

283
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:46,877
<i>"Together"?</i>

284
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:50,297
Okay. Let's eat together.

285
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,217
Abalone?

286
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,387
Did something happen to the ocean?

287
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,157
This is definitely an abalone shell.

288
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:13,017
But it tastes like a scallop.

289
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,257
What is it, a hybrid or something?

290
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:20,677
She couldn't have given all the abalone

291
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:24,307
to our neighbor instead of his cute brother...

292
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:26,057
She...

293
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,617
did.

294
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:33,457
I really enjoyed it, Teacher.

295
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:36,537
No, no, no. No, no.

296
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:39,067
Stay there. I'll put it away.

297
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,597
That is impossible. You cannot-

298
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:46,347
Come on. Will you really go against your teacher's will?

299
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:49,917
- My apologies.
- I'll do everything.

300
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:54,857
The sick student should stay put right here and lie down.

301
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:07,057
What?

302
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,527
Does no one care for him?

303
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:24,237
Oh, right.

304
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:27,977
Yoon Bok, something great happened to me today.

305
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,707
He should sleep comfortably to recover quickly.

306
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:34,467
Seriously.

307
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,647
Yoon Bok,

308
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:03,837
I was motivated when you told me I was a great teacher.

309
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,117
So, I tried being courageous today.

310
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:12,217
And something really cool actually happened.

311
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:14,527
It's thanks to you, Yoon Bok.

312
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:16,317
Thank you.

313
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:44,977
<i>He's so handsome-</i>

314
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:50,027
<i>Gosh, what am I thinking when he's sick?</i>

315
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:06,257
It is warm, Teacher.

316
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,827
Teacher.

317
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:52,627
<i>Yoon Bok, did you sleep well?</i>

318
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:54,807
<i>I put the rest of the porridge in the fridge.</i>

319
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:58,157
<i>Heat it up later, and don't forget to take the medicine.</i>

320
00:26:58,157 --> 00:27:02,017
<i>You need to eat well when you are ill.</i>

321
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:03,287
<i>Okay?</i>

322
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:07,747
I am greatly indebted to her again.

323
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:23,607
Strike one.

324
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,547
- Pardon?
- Strike one.

325
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:31,867
Stop being Losi Fashion's assistant.

326
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:36,137
I hired you as a designer, not an assistant.

327
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,607
Got it.

328
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,087
Nouveautés et harmonie.

329
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:47,297
I hate designers who don't get that.

330
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,847
- Nouveautés?
- Nouveautés et harmonie.

331
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,807
Newness and harmony.

332
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:01,077
It's Camille's philosophy in fashion.

333
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:03,677
Something traditional and new.

334
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,907
Elegant and splendid.

335
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:07,617
Bright and dark.

336
00:28:07,617 --> 00:28:10,877
Hot and so cold.

337
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:11,967
Something like that.

338
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:15,677
What Camille wants is a double-edged sword.

339
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:20,777
"I will not lose out on anything." Something like that.

340
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:23,807
But Hong Do Kim, you're a bit...

341
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:27,037
You're very refreshing,

342
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:32,077
but that's all there is.

343
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,777
Gosh, I'm so nosy. Follow me.

344
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:51,247
This is all Camille?

345
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,587
My gosh!

346
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,567
So pretty.

347
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:02,627
Use these to sharpen the double-edged sword if necessary.

348
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:04,897
Is that really okay?

349
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:07,507
Camille is a woman who's like wine.

350
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:13,557
She can be sweet, but she can send you away immediately.

351
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:19,607
I hope you survive without striking out three times.

352
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,517
Fighting.

353
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,417
Thank you.

354
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,327
My gosh!

355
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:31,077
So pretty. My gosh.

356
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:42,357
Here you go.

357
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:44,277
- Thank you.
- Sure.

358
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:56,777
Where are the other documents?

359
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:08,797
Okay, shall we look for it, then?

360
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:23,397
♫ <i>I just stared at you smiling in front of me</i> ♫

361
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:26,097

00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:48,427
You're sick, too.

542
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:50,487
What's going on?

543
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:58,497
I was contacted by the one who cut ties and left a long time ago.

544
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,607
Someone who left?

545
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:07,397
I am sorry I am making you worry again.

546
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:10,507
No, I'm okay.

547
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:17,077
She must've been someone very precious to you.

548
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:19,867
Since you're hurting so much now.

549
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,367

550
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,897
but I guess that is not necessarily the case.

551
00:48:34,897 --> 00:48:38,147
No one is used to being alone.

552
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:41,917
And why are you alone? You have Hong Hak and me.

553
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:46,417
I'll drink with you or listen to you if you're struggling.

554

I'd do anything.

555
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:50,557
