1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,960
Hou Liangyuan is very likely

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,700
the Jiang Yongquan
we've been looking for.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,020
That's also the reason
why the task force

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,510
sent you to go undercover.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,550
The person is right beside us,

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,640
but the evidence
is still hanging on a cliff.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,440
Find a way to follow Hou Liangyuan

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,070
and take down the trafficking gang

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,280
behind him.

12
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,910
(Wuyang City News)
The ribbon-cutting ceremony

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,630
for the opening

14
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,150
of Manwu Green Farm Tourist Resort

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,840
officially begins.

16
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,680
If you don't want to watch, then don't.

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
Mr. Gao is more important.

18
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,630
One resort in exchange for one USB drive

19
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,030
is not a loss.

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,800
Hou Liangyuan

21
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,630
told me

22
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,560
Xu Yi added a password to the USB drive.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,800
He must be the one who killed Xu Yi.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,270
I think

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,480
he just wants to take it all.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Don't be angry.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,400
Say some nice words to Mr. Gao.

28
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,280
Ask him to wait for several days.

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,280
You really are generous.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,750
I have no choice.

31
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,000
Am I not yours?

32
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,590
You still want me to go?

33
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,000
This is also for us.

34
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,710
But I'm preparing for pregnancy.

35
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,240
Haven't you always wanted

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
a child of ours?

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,840
How obedient.

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,870
Don't make me go.

39
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,870
Alright.

40
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,830
The tech dpt. has analyzed it.

41
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,730
Among the projects handled
by Zhao Xueli,

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,910
those related to Mai Boyuan

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,910
have no issues.

44
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,310
Only one ledger related to investment

45
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,150
has gone missing.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Hu Bo happened to be in charge

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,350
of this investment project.

48
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
Other people in their company

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
have no knowledge of the project.

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Now, Hu Bo and Zhao Xueli

51
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
are both dead.

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,030
The lead ends here again.

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
Captain He,

54
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,530
I had Liu Ming investigate Liu Wanyao's

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,250
social activities
over the past 10 years.

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
No records in two years.

57
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,830
She might be under house arrest

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,800
in Xu Yi's clubhouse.

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,010
This is relevant info

60
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,150
about Zhao Xueli's company.

61
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,820
(Leisure farm; Ledger lost)

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,510
Have you checked the identities

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,070
of those women in the surveillance?

64
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,920
We're comparing with the database.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,410
The results should be available

66
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,370
within a day or two.

67
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,490
Once the results come out,

68
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,130
inform Yin Wei

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,180
and let him go find them.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,260
Sure, I'll be going now.

71
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,160
What's on your mind?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,390
These people are really jerks.

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,680
Those girls just graduated.

74
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,070
It's still just speculation.

75
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,450
There's no evidence yet.

76
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
Understood.

77
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,350
I'll go check.

78
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,320
Sorry that you had to put up with this.

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,190
I bought a gift for you.

80
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Do you like it?

81
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,110
What about Mr. Gao?

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
No chance of easing things?

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,070
Did you explain it?

84
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,360
Mr. Gao used to bring me money.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,750
Now, he's targeting me.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,520
One sentence from me

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
can make the project I invested in

88
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,870
lose everything with no return.

89
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,430
This is my biggest investment.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,950
It is our lifeline.

91
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,600
Did you do your best?

92
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,600
I'm already like this.

93
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,000
What do you think?

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,310
Xu Yi's death came at the wrong time.

95
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,030
It's Hou Liangyuan's fault.

96
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,630
With the resort,

97
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,720
he thought everything was fine.

98
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,920
I've started short-selling.

99
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,510
He won't even find

100
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,430
a place to cry.

101
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,510
Will he give you

102
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,720
the USB drive that way?

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,270
I have to prepare
for both possibilities.

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
If he hands it over,

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,160
everything can be discussed.

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,730
If he doesn't hand it over,

107
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,310
I can only go to another place

108
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,160
and start over.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,920
Speaking of which,

110
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,430
if Liang Xinyue

111
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,630
hadn't brought the clues

112
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,270
to Hou Liangyuan,

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,310
the police would surely

114
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,510
have followed Xu Yi's trail to me.

115
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,430
She's the one who can handle things.

116
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,000
You want to cut ties with me?

117
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
That's fine.

118
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,390
Transfer the remaining batch

119
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
of the paintings I took

120
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,560
from your company.

121
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,870
When it's done,

122
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
we will be clear.

123
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
The last batch.

124
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,630
Rest assured, Ms. Liang.

125
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,230
Don't worry.

126
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,750
As you said, I've converted

127
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,510
the money he laundered abroad

128
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,360
into gold

129
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
and stored it

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
in a safe overseas in your name.

131
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,760
You'd better get the delivery order

132
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,240
from Liang Xinyue asap.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,270
Don't worry.

134
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,190
I know what to do.

135
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,700
(Yifang Courtyard)

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Ms. Liang.

137
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,870
Are all the exhibits arranged?

138
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,520
13 pieces are being maintained.

139
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,900
They can be arranged by tonight.

140
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,950
Show me the list of the last batch.

141
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,300
(Liang Xinyue)

142
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
(At the beginning,)

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,750
(I thought I was avenging Xinxin.)

144
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,150
(Hu Bo)
(Actually, it was for myself.)

145
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,000
(Zhao Xueli)

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
(Xu Yi)
(In my view,)

147
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,020
(human trafficking is the greatest evil)

148
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
(in this world.)

149
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,150
(Sometimes, I even hope)

150
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,270
(that I'd died that day.)

151
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,850
(Liang Xinyue, Mai Boyuan)
(Before more people get hurt,)

152
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,360
(I will send you to hell.)

153
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:18,940
(Mai Boyuan, Hou Liangyuan, Xu Yi)

154
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,700
(Xu Yi; Recently; Resort)

155
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,740
(Reward Notice,
Wuyang Public Security Bureau)

156
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
We need to cooperate.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,750
That resort needs investment now.

158
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,670
Mr. Hou, I have no money.

159
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,080
Officer Xu,

160
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,200
you've been suspended.

161
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,000
What can you offer me?

162
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,040
I was suspended

163
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,030
because of Mai Boyuan.

164
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,320
You're also having a hard time

165
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,080
because of Mai Boyuan, right?

166
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,300
How do you know

167
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,440
Mai Boyuan is behind this?

168
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,790
Before Xu Yi died, he said,

169
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,590
"Hou Liangyuan."

170
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,080
"Be careful."

171
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,840
How should this be understood?

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,670
Was he telling others
to be careful of you,

173
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,910
or telling you to be careful of others?

174
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,120
As far as I know,

175
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,190
Mai Boyuan invited someone back

176
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,310
from abroad

177
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,550
to solve problems for him.

178
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,670
That person killed

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,910
both Hu Bo

180
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,600
and Zhao Xueli.

181
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,870
Could you

182
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,200
be his next target?

183
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,080
Great writer,

184
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,540
are you making up stories?

185
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,870
I can tell you who this person is.

186
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
Can you bring him here?

187
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,730
I have a way to bring him here.

188
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,910
You are a cop.

189
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,200
I don't trust you.

190
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,570
You can call the police.

191
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,320
How do you plan to handle Mai Boyuan?

192
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Are you going to cooperate with me

193
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,960
or not?

194
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,670
What exactly do you want?

195
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,440
Evidence of the truth
behind Zhao Xueli's death.

196
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,030
Then I'll wait for your good news.

197
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
Goodbye.

198
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
Interesting.

199
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,270
That move can be made now.

200
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,500
(Case Clue Analysis)

201
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
Director Feng.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,550
Release the Witness Reward Notice

203
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,960
for Xu Yi's death scene.

204
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,840
You've suffered lately.

205
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,910
Is there no one to share

206
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,790
your work?

207
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,030
Hou Liangyuan has a USB drive.

208
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,610
Decrypt it and then give it to me.

209
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,420
(Original Coffee)

210
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,880
(One Million Yuan)
This is the deposit.

211
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,360
After you give it to me,

212
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,970
I will give you the remaining half.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,910
He doesn't have to be alive, right?

214
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,300
I only want the USB drive.

215
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,350
I don't care about anything else.

216
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,660
(One Million Yuan)

217
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,870
The USB drive looks like this.

218
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,640
He keeps a close watch on it.

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,670
He puts it in a very safe place

220
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,150
or carries it with him.

221
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,910
Useless words.

222
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
(One Million Yuan)

223
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Why did you lose so many things?

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,960
So much leverage in others' hands.

225
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,630
Why do you talk so much?

226
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
Ms. Zhao,

227
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,320
bracelets aren't for you.

228
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,270
They're like shackles.

229
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,630
Have a seat.

230
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
Does it hurt?

231
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,510
You need to know

232
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,670
who I am doing this for.

233
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,910
Of course, I know.

234
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,390
I feel very guilty

235
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,790
for failing to protect you.

236
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,160
Can that man

237
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,200
really get the USB drive?

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,030
He handled

239
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,030
the ledger well.

240
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,270
As you know,

241
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,750
Mr. Gao is in a hurry to get it.

242
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,440
This thing is too critical.

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,510
I can't guarantee

244
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,440
whether he can get it back.

245
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,830
But he's completed so many

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
difficult tasks.

247
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,480
Let's wait.

248
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,830
Give him some time.

249
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,000
Why not tell me about you moving?

250
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,890
I haven't had the chance.

251
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,750
I didn't expect you to be here.

252
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,000
You care about me so much?

253
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,830
Your fruit is a bit stale.

254
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,020
I'm not the first one
to warm your house, am I?

255
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,750
Zhao Xin,

256
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,440
PR Manager of Longyuan Group,

257
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,480
has been here.

258
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,830
What do you want to do?

259
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,920
Or

260
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,640
what do you need me to do?

261
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,350
I want the truth.

262
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,160
The truth

263
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,650
about how I reached this point today.

264
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
What is your answer?

265
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Zhao Xin and I

266
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,020
are not in a relationship.

267
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,790
I need to help her retrieve something.

268
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
Perhaps the truth you want

269
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,350
is right inside.

270
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,350
What about you?

271
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,840
A result.

272
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,160
One that only you

273
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,240
can give me.

274
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,300
Even if it's a result you don't want?

275
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
No one knows

276
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,500
what the result will be

277
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,540
until the very last step.

278
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,300
(No fake passport for going abroad.)

279
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,180
(No receipt order.)

280
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,040
Xu Jingzhi?

281
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,310
Oh, the crow is here.

282
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,400
Who are you drinking with?

283
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,720
You're back.

284
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,030
Who else could I drink with?

285
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,270
Who's influencing you now?

286
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,240
Emotions.

287
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,950
My foot.

288
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,040
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

289
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,910
How did that happen?

290
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,440
I twisted it while chasing a suspect.

291
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,920
What suspect?

292
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
Just two thieves.

293
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,600
What's going on?

294
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,870
Come on.

295
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,110
No offense, but you're too competitive.

296
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,790
What's the point?

297
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,750
Aren't you the captain?

298
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,830
How much have you drunk?

299
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,440
I just started drinking.

300
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,510
How come it feels like you're drunk?

301
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
It's the case, not the wine.

302
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,310
The case?

303
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,790
You're suspended. What case is it?

304
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,240
Wow, drunk as a lord.

305
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,200
Why should I worry?

306
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,070
I've been suspended, yeah.

307
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,070
It's because of you.

308
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,880
Because of me?

309
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,640
Am I the reason why you became a cop?

310
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,000
You...

311
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,720
Why did you become a cop?

312
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,110
Because

313
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,440
I liked it myself.

314
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,550
Of course, now it's more...

315
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,650
It's more about responsibility.

316
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,000
And you?

317
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,850
Why did you become a cop?

318
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,880
You've made huge progress.

319
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,260
Do you dare to say your father

320
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,300
isn't part of the reason?

321
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,270
I can only say you've improved.

322
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,750
I became a cop because of you.

323
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,850
It hasn't changed even now.

324
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
Of course.

325
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
My career

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,110
as a cop

327
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,440
has different stages.

328
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,720
It was because of you before.

329
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,680
As I kept working,

330
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,160
I felt that being a cop could give me

331
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,400
a chance for self-exploration.

332
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,750
Now, I think

333
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,510
one's true self has nothing

334
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,270
to do with their job.

335
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,860
I don't give a darn now.

336
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,160
Watch your language.

337
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,750
That language makes me

338
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,240
seem more manly, right?

339
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,390
You don't like it?

340
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,680
You've gained a lot of insights

341
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,510
while staying at home lately.

342
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,780
Will you still teach me

343
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,780
ways to relieve anxiety?

344
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Sure.

345
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,000
Inhale.

346
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,960
Why breathe with your chest?

347
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,720
I just realized it.

348
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,880
Can you be serious?

349
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,270
Everyone breathes with their abdomen.

350
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,350
I am using my abdomen.

351
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,450
Stop staring at my chest;

352
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,590
then it won't be a problem.

353
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,520
But your chest

354
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,720
naturally rises and falls.

355
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,440
I can't press it down.

356
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,320
Come on.

357
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Don't joke around.

358
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,960
Breathe with your abdomen.

359
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,590
Focus on the position.

360
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,920
The key area is the abdomen.

361
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,440
Not the chest.

362
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,300
Look.

363
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,260
My hand is placed here.

364
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,040
Yes, yes.

365
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,760
- I know.
- Get ready.

366
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,970
No distracting thoughts.

367
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,390
Inhale.

368
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,150
Much better.

369
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,870
Hold on.

370
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,390
One.

371
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,590
Two.

372
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,950
Three.

373
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,590
Hold on.

374
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,590
One.

375
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,630
Two.

376
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,670
Three.

377
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Four.

378
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,870
Five.

379
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,870
Hold on.

380
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Six.

381
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,940
(Safe travels)

382
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,830
Mai Boyuan,

383
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,070
how is it going?

384
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,290
Don't worry.

385
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,750
The video will be retrieved soon.

386
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,430
By the way, Mr. Gao,

387
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,350
about the project you helped me get,

388
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,400
can the payment be made asap?

389
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,790
What's the rush?

390
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,350
Give me the video first.

391
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,740
I'm on a business trip
in Hong Kong, China.

392
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
I'll apologize to you once I get back.

393
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,830
You'll surely have the video.

394
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm sending you two new goods.

395
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,630
What do you think?

396
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,960
How considerate.

397
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,510
Alright, it's settled then.

398
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,720
Xu Yi teamed up

399
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,540
with Monkey to blackmail me

400
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,930
with Mr. Gao's video.

401
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,110
This is really a big trouble.

402
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
Don't be mad.

403
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,160
It's just a small setback.

404
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,440
Think about the money the project makes.

405
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,000
Feeling better now?

406
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,960
You know how to cheer me up.

407
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,910
Of course.

408
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,350
Where's your bracelet?

409
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,280
It broke; I threw it away.

410
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,310
It wasn't worth anything anyway.

411
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,150
Another day,

412
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,880
I'll give you a good one.

413
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,950
Sure.

414
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,940
(Hou)

415
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,870
Who is it?

416
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,200
Who else could it be?

417
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,870
I think he

418
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,440
should be called Mad Dog.

419
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,440
You promised your wife

420
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,400
to have dinner with her tonight.

421
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,510
It's her birthday.

422
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,150
You forgot?

423
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,210
Then I'll head back first.

424
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,150
Go ahead.

425
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,040
Mr. Xu?

426
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,950
Mr. Xu?

427
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,240
Mr. Xu?

428
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,910
Mr. Xu?

429
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,280
Zhuang Mingcheng.

430
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,270
You really keep your word.

431
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
Yes.

432
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,950
Yes.

433
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,240
That's right.

434
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
This is the Xu Jingzhi I know.

435
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,160
You always use others

436
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,880
to handle your affairs.

437
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,140
(Delivery order)

438
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,260
(To Zhi Fei: I got the delivery order.)
