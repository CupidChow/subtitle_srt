3
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,790
Captain He,

4
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,330
the other group

5
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,470
of rescued victims are here,

6
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,760
ready for an interview anytime.

7
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,040
(Interview room)

8
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,200
I don't remember.

9
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,070
Once the car started moving,

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,310
I smelled something

11
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,560
like wood.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Dogs barking, chickens clucking.

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,560
It must've been a village.

14
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,120
They deserve to die!

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
He's not even human.

16
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,760
Officer.

17
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,480
He kept saying I was

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
his runaway daughter,

19
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,640
and he was taking me home.

20
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,560
I begged passers-by for help.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,790
No one believed me.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,510
He said he was lost

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,120
and asked me to lead the way.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,730
So,

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,240
I got into his car.

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,430
They'd paw us,

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,590
but that man stopped

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
anything else,

29
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,560
saying we'd be

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,270
worth less

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,630
if we were touched.

32
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,150
I was 17,

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,800
on my way to register at college,

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,430
when Hou Liangyuan abducted me.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,710
After some time,

36
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,120
he gave me to Mai Boyuan.

37
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,840
What's your name?

38
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,520
It must be a misunderstanding.

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,030
Tell me.

40
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,560
Let's sort it out.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,560
Grudges can always be fixed,

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
right?

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,800
Is it Xu Yi?

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,240
He didn't know what not to do.

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,590
I told him

46
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,400
some lines he couldn't cross,

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
but he wouldn't listen.

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
It's my fault.

49
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,520
What do you want?

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Tell me.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
I'll give you anything.

52
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,750
We had a simple

53
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,800
business arrangement.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,310
He asked me to source

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,240
contemporary art for export sales.

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,300
(Art Auctions)
These transaction sums

57
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,540
are far above the market price
for comparable pieces.

58
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,590
How do you explain that?

59
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,910
He's a businessman.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,870
A businessman

61
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,680
creates value

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,840
where others don't see it.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,470
He's good at that.

64
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,360
I think that is normal.

65
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,430
You consider this normal?

66
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,870
Art

67
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,630
carries extra value.

68
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,630
Commercially speaking,

69
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,750
it's standard practice.

70
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,430
Where did all this come from?

(Longyuan Group Sex-Trafficking Case)

Gifts from Mai Boyuan.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,630
He'd hand me money from time to time,

74
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,560
luxury goods,

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,750
and even cars and apartments.

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,720
What have you done for Mai Boyuan?

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,270
You've found out, right?

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,950
Look at these girls' photos.

79
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,950
Every file
about their disappearance carries

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,280
(Project-funding file)
your signature.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,310
I only wanted to stay alive.

82
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,270
Compared with what they did to me,

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,680
I was gentle with those girls.

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,310
I never meant to hurt them.

85
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,900
Let me go.

86
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll have money wired to you.

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
How about that?

88
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,190
You were with Mai Boyuan

89
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,040
for years.

90
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,360
Do you know what he

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,500
and Hou Liangyuan were doing?

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,950
Is this for a sentence reduction?

93
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,710
It depends on how much you tell us.

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,630
He valued my connections

95
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,560
and admired my abilities.

96
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,270
At that time,

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
he began buying art in bulk

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,480
and had me move it overseas.

99
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,800
The assets

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
should be almost fully transferred.

101
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,310
I was a gift from Hou Liangyuan

102
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,480
to Mai Boyuan

103
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
while he was building

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,480
the commercial street and the factories.

105
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,360
On the surface,

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
Hou Liangyuan was

107
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
supplying earthwork and materials;

108
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,600
in truth, he kept trafficking women.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,070
He kept a lot of thugs on payroll.

110
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,040
He once told me

111
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,830
to come back to him

112
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,000
after I'd built a tie

113
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,430
with Mai Boyuan.

114
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
I didn't want to,

115
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
so I begged Mai Boyuan

116
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,390
to let me stay.

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,750
Neither place was good,

118
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,070
but at least I wouldn't be

119
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,310
passed around anymore.

120
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
Later...

121
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,110
You already know

122
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,430
the dirty work later.

123
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,270
Apart from selling artworks for him,

124
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,120
did you two have any other business?

125
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,390
No.

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,270
Mai Boyuan's smart.

127
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,830
His business is doing great.

128
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,240
Hou Liangyuan's a nothing.

129
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,160
All he thinks about is

130
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,190
who gets the next girl.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
When that stopped working,

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,560
he switched to filming videos

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,310
and blackmailing people for leverage.

134
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,950
What's Xu Yi's relationship

135
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,030
with them?

136
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,830
That's a total jerk.

137
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,430
Mai Boyuan brought him in

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,480
to replace Hou Liangyuan,

139
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,270
but Hou and Xu

140
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,360
hit it off

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
and teamed up instead.

142
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,240
If Mai ever escapes,

143
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,830
his first job will be

144
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,800
to erase both of them.

145
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,750
Can't you tell me what you want?

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
You're crazy.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,480
Let go of me!

148
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,120
What do you want?

149
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
You...

150
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,430
Who sent you?

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,270
Was Mai Boyuan planning

152
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,240
to take you with him?

153
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,910
Next month,

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,000
I might take some days off.

155
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
Son,

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,390
anywhere you wanna go?

157
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll take you.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
The bear you gave me

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,790
is always with me.

160
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,960
Do you see it?

161
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,840
He went

162
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,120
through all this trouble

163
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,910
just to target you.

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
What's he trying to get

165
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,320
from you?

166
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,120
Some people stay chained

167
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
to one past moment,

168
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
one person,

169
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,240
craving approval and acceptance.

170
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,120
You're that person.

(Tomb of Lu Ran)

173
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
Talk.

174
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,550
Tell me everything you've done.

175
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Do you hear me?

176
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Talk,

177
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,510
and I'll set you free.

178
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,000
I started by selling people.

179
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
Kids first.

180
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,480
Then girls

181
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,550
for prostitution and videos.

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,870
I used the tapes to extort.

183
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,990
Director Feng.

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,270
Come for a meeting now.

185
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,150
Liu Wanyao kidnapped Mai Boyuan.

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,150
I got a taste for it.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
To win the contracts

188
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
for the commercial street

189
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,150
and the factories,

190
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,750
I...

191
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,840
I handed girls over

192
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,600
as gifts.

193
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,550
The disobedient ones were disposed of.

194
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,390
Later, I moved into finance

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,630
and met

196
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,000
bigger fish.

197
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,630
Sex bribes

198
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,120
were too slow,

199
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,870
so I used Liang Xinyue

200
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,390
in artwork export

201
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,670
to launder money.

202
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,440
Then I met

203
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,630
her husband Xu Yi

204
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,910
and opened a clubhouse for him

205
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,960
to cook my books.

206
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,750
But he and Hou Liangyuan

207
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,840
used the clubhouse to traffic girls.

208
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,720
Later, I thought of Liang Xinyue's

209
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,870
nursing school.

210
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
Those girls

211
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,200
could be used for prostitution.

212
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,320
She forced me to say those things.

213
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
Police!

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,910
Help me, police!

215
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,440
Get me out of here!

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,360
The extracted audio waveform

217
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,910
shows reverb.

218
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,750
In the audio,

219
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,360
two identical patterns appear,

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,030
repeating 0.07 s later.

221
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,910
It repeated

222
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,360
with a decrease

223
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,720
0.08 s later.

224
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,510
Mai Boyuan is likely inside

225
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,870
an enclosed space.

226
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
Glints

227
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,900
in the video background

228
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,670
point to a shipping container.

229
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,240
If so,

230
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,510
it probably is

231
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,720
a 30-chi cargo container.

232
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,390
We pulled records

233
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,320
from every freight

234
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,840
and logistics firm in Wuyang.

235
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,390
No containers were reported lost

236
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,630
or damaged.

237
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,750
But abandoned containers

238
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,320
can't be ruled out.

239
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,440
Based on the info

240
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,540
provided by the tech dept.,

241
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,390
in this 8-minute live video,

242
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,600
there were two occurrences

243
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,960
of external HF sound waves

244
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,010
with vibration frequency matching

245
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,450
that of an industrial electric drill.

246
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,550
We're assuming

247
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,510
a construction site

248
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,000
near the container.

249
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,080
Cross-reference

250
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,630
active building sites

251
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,000
with the known locations

252
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,600
of containers asap.

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
Keep me

254
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,630
updated.

255
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,670
The cops will come to save you, right?

256
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,600
Your hands are soaked in blood.

257
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,750
If someone saves you,

258
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
what about me?

259
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,080
Who's coming for me?

260
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,440
Who?

261
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
You're a girl

262
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,840
from the clubhouse,

263
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,720
right?

264
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,030
What did I do?

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,270
Why won't you let me go?

266
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,270
I'll give you anything

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,790
you want.

268
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,480
Don't do something stupid.

269
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,670
Xinxin and I had planned

270
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
that after we graduated,

271
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,790
we'd pass the hospital exam

272
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,080
and go traveling.

273
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,960
But before I could graduate,

274
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,670
I was tricked into Jinmengwan.

275
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,750
Principal Xu.

276
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,270
Liu Wanyao,

277
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,140
I've got great news.

278
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,840
I've found a hospital
that will take you.

279
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,440
I'm driving you there today.

280
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,870
Thank you. That's great.

281
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,350
- Hop in.
- Sure.

282
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,750
This is a caregiver from the hospital,

283
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,930
a future colleague of yours.

284
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,870
He's coming along.

285
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,920
Sure. Hi, everyone.

286
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,030
Hi. Mind your head.

287
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,160
A toast to Mr. Liang.

288
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,030
Come on, Mr. Liang.

289
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
Cheers.

290
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,720
- Have fun.
- Have fun.

291
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,760
Mr. Hu.

292
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
She's here.

293
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,310
Come here.

294
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,160
Have a seat.

295
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,920
Why are you here?

296
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,200
Come here.

297
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
Go.

298
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,030
Sorry, Mr. Yao.

299
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,870
Sorry.

300
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,910
She's not the one.

301
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,550
I'll get you another one.

302
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,720
My apologies.

303
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,070
Liu Wanyao,

304
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,790
you know

305
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,160
what I do now.

306
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,310
You're just as filthy.

307
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
Listen.

308
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,200
Keep your mouth shut.

309
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,550
If you keep Wu Xinxin in the dark,

310
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,400
I can send you to a decent man.

311
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,520
But

312
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,750
if you tell her,

313
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,070
I'll send both of you

314
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,750
to a man

315
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,030
to keep him company.

316
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,110
How dare you mention Wu Xinxin!

317
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,960
Let go!

318
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,000
You jerk!

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,720
Sorry, Mr. Hu! Sorry!

320
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
Watch your tongue.

321
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
I won't let you off.

322
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,880
You jerk!

323
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,880
It took me a year to escape.

324
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Guess

325
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,830
who I saw inside?

326
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,590
Yeah.

327
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,510
My life is garbage.

328
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,720
Even my mom wishes

329
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I were dead.

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,480
I can live with that.

331
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,680
But Xinxin died.

332
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,000
Hu Bo...

333
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,440
Why do we have to bear

334
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,400
the consequences

335
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,310
of your actions?

336
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,550
Why?

337
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,750
Everything behind this

338
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,680
is tied to you,

339
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,830
so none of you

340
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,110
can get away.

341
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
It's all because of you.

342
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,030
It's all because of you.

343
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,270
It's all because of you.

344
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,270
Do you understand?

345
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,660
(Police)

346
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,980
(SWAT)

347
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,590
I heard

348
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,270
that a person

349
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,640
can last ten days

350
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,590
on water alone.

351
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,950
Hello?

352
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,080
No one here.

353
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,640
I've checked nearby areas.

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,350
No recent signs of activity.

355
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,750
Whoever took Mai Boyuan

356
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,960
is misleading us.

357
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,200
Keep hunting that suspicious boat.

358
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
Check this again.

359
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,950
Captain He.

360
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
Mr. Xu.

361
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,110
Liang Xinyue and Zhao Xin

362
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,460
are almost through interrogation.

363
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,640
Every station

364
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,760
and auxiliary unit

365
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,310
is out searching for Mai Boyuan.

366
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,750
Still nothing. We're waiting for news.

367
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm dead on my feet.

368
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,400
Mr. Xu, your nose is bleeding.

369
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
Let me, let me.

370
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,880
Raise your head.

371
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,790
Got the little gadget?

372
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,790
Sort out the files on Zhuang Mingcheng

373
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,920
and Mai Boyuan first.

374
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,170
We can't keep doing this.

375
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,030
It's been 48 hours.
No one can handle that.

376
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,400
Let's split into two teams.

377
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,750
Liu Ming, go home and sleep.

378
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,270
Xu Jingzhi, sleep.

379
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,270
Mr. Xu, Yin, bye.

380
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,110
You found the chief culprit for me.

381
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,750
Thanks for the gift.

382
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
He was also the chief culprit

383
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,840
who abducted me.

384
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,440
We each got what we needed.

385
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,200
Nice to work with you.

386
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,590
After Mai Boyuan is dead,

387
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,720
I'll give you a new life.

388
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,000
You still have a future.

389
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,190
Future?

390

What future is there for me?

391
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,960
You can go anywhere you want

392
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,790
and do anything you like.

393
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,510
But you already

394
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,590
tried that for me.

395
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,310
In the end, you came back.

396
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,640
You and I are different.

397
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Right.

398
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,720
We're different.

399
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,400
You still have hope.

401
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,430

Fish.

407
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,440
You should split it

408
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,280
into smaller crates.

409
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,500

- You always do this.
- Sorry.

416
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,520
