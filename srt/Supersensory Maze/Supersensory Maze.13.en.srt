1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,640
Society is essentially
a collective of people,

2
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,710
rather than people themselves.

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,510
Human nature inherently contains

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,710
the animal's beastly instincts.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,960
We should return to nature.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,220
The difference
between society and nature

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,000
lies in the fact
that society has certain

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,350
moral objectives.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,320
As long as one is still human,

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,000
there is no escape

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,640
from symbiosis in biology.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,670
Just like you and me right now.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,560
Symbiosis in psychology

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,670
does not refer to a mutually beneficial

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,280
and dependent relationship,

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,320
but rather a mutually reliant

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,520
and destructive one.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,140
Let's go.

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,990
It's time.

20
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,260

21
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,220
=Episode 13=

22
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
Ms. Zhao,

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,250
please cooperate with our work.

24
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,030
Captain He.

25
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,030
Are you in charge here?

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
Yes.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
I don't understand.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
I saved someone bravely.

29
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,360
Why am I being suspected?

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,800
We just spoke

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,740
with the traffic police

32
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,730
and the hospital.

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,850
We know you are the witness

34
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,880
who reported the case.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,940
You're here just to answer
some questions.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
Let me take a look.

37
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,250
The wound is not deep.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,190
Do you know who called the ambulance?

39
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,960
It seems to be a lady

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
named Zhao Xin.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,950
I don't know anything else.

42
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,680
That's impossible.

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,630
So, it really was you who took it.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Sorry about that.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
It happened so suddenly.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,510
My thoughts are a bit scattered.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,240
Could you try to recall?

48
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,280
At the scene of the accident,

49
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,630
did you notice anything?

50
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,470
Suspicious people,

51
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,150
or suspicious vehicles?

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
When I got there,

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,590
the car had overturned.

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,000
I was waiting at a red light.

55
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,630
But it seems

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
there was a car

57
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,240
that drove past there.

58
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,840
Did you see the driver?

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
No, I didn't get a clear look.

60
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,190
The license plate number seemed

61
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,080
to be 4, something, 7, 7, and 4.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
4722.

63
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,560
4722.

64
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,680
Why? Isn't this

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,840
just an ordinary accident?

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,140
It is still under investigation.

67
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,280
Thanks for your cooperation today.

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,250
If you remember anything later,

69
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,240
feel free to contact us.

70
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,120
Okay.

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,030
Then please,

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
come here and sign.

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,390
Leave your contact info.

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,620
- Here?
- Yes.

75
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,230
By the way, Ms. Zhao,

76
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,600
I wonder if you saw the lady

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,800
you saved when you went
to the hospital.

78
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,380
(Signed by: Zhao Xin)

79
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,320
She should be very grateful to you.

80
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,710
Where is the thing I asked for?

81
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,040
With this,

82
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,920
you can get the truth you want

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,160
and also deal with Mai Boyuan.

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,170
Did you change your mind?

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,920
Businessmen value integrity the most.

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
How could I do that?

87
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,910
It's just

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,000
a small bit of extra demand.

89
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,750
A last-minute demand. How phony.

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,870
I am

91
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,360
timid.

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,870
I fear death.

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,870
You were once a cop.

94
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm scared of you now.

95
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,310
Why don't you assure me?

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,870
Kill him,

97
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
and I'll give you the ledger.

98
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,950
Are you joking, Mr. Hou?

99
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,310
Helping a good citizen like me

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,630
sleep soundly

101
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,560
is the responsibility of the police.

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,310
Thanks for taking me for a walk.

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
We don't think

104
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,240
this is a simple traffic accident.

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,410
The traffic police examined the scene.

106
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,390
It should be an intentional murder.

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,270
Think carefully.

108
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,600
Is there any enemy

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
or suspect?

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
I don't know.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,600
It was too dark to see clearly.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,120
It seems like there was someone.

113
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,430
It looked like a woman.

114
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,870
Did you lose anything?

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,460
No.

116
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,720
My subordinates have checked.

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,070
We will check

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,920
the dashcam in the car

119
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,420
and the surveillance along the road.

120
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,270
We'll naturally know

121
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,360
what happened.

122
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,110
Got it.

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Thanks, Officer He.

124
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
He's a man.

125
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,270
Not a chicken.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,870
I just want the truth.

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,430
I don't want to get

128
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,660
deeper and deeper into this.

129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,190
Why should I kill anyone?

130
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,920
Boring.

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,720
If you don't want to do it,

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
is there anything else

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,240
we can trade?

134
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,390
I have what you want.

135
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,510
I know where the money

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,750
Xu Yi embezzled

137
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,870
from the clubhouse is hidden.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,190
I planned to surprise you

139
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
with that after the deal

140
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
was done tonight.

141
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,510
One useful person

142
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,830
is enough.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,840
Show

144
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,000
Mr. Xu

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
our sincerity.

146
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,000
Mr. Hou, Mr. Hou.

147
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
Mr. Hou.

148
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,710
Mr. Hou, Mr. Hou.

149
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,120
Don't you want to look

150
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,000
at what I have?

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,910
Mai Boyuan.

152
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,320
What a surprise.

153
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,200
I got you again.

154
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,750
My patience is limited.

155
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,440
Though you withdrew

156
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
from the Central Road Project,

157
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,360
you can't go anywhere

158
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,790
without my consent.

159
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,320
As long as you're still in Wuyang,

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
you can't escape from my grasp.

161
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,270
I'll give you the last three days

162
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
to hand over the USB drive.

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,670
I want the goods there

164
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,420
within three days.

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,510
Is there any problem?

166
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,990
I know.

167
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,070
Don't worry.

168
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,550
I will send the goods on time.

169
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,750
Okay

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,940
I trust you.

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,750
After this order, don't call me again.

172
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,790
What did Mai Boyuan do to offend you?

173
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,120
Why betray him without hesitation?

174
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,150
Do you know what these photos mean

175
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,510
to Gao?

176
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,710
Forget about him.

177
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,630
Aren't you afraid that I'll move

178
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
once I get the photos?

179
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,630
At most,

180
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,960
he's just a client.

181
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,550
I'd be foolish to risk my life

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
for a client.

183
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,870
You just asked me

184
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
if I was afraid.

185
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,870
The photos are just a greeting gift.

186
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,270
Since I just gave them to you,

187
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,720
that means

188
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,720
I have something even better.

189
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,840
As for Zhao Xin,

190
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,510
she entrusted me to deal with you.

191
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,200
The goal is the USB drive.

192
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,840
After I decrypt it, I'll give it to her.

193
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,720
As for you...

194
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,150
Your life doesn't matter.

195
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,150
What a wench.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,270
She'd wish I could die.

197
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,240
After I hooked her up with Mai Boyuan,

198
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,120
she wants to get rid of me.

199
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,710
What a wench.

200
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,630
How about this?

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,150
Once I decrypt

202
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,150
that USB drive,

203
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,760
I'll hand it over to you.

204
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,630
Untie Mr. Zhuang now.

205
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,440
You just said

206
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,320
one useful person is enough,

207
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
right?

208
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,440
So, his life

209
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,270
belongs to me, right?

210
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,320
After all, I've never been a cop.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,510
I don't have those boring moral burdens.

212
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,540
(Auction Item Shipping List)

213
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,620
(See the signature page later)

214
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Send the latest order out

215
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
as soon as possible.

216
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,560
Is that so?

217
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
Maybe I forgot.

218
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,670
Put that page in a safe place.

219
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,670
Hello, Mr. Gao?

220
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,350
Here's the thing.

221
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,670
About that USB drive,

222
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,510
I have some new info.

223
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,360
I'd like to talk to you privately.

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,720
Sure, see you tomorrow, Mr. Gao.

225
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,690
I'll be waiting for you.

226
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
In this world,

227
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,750
money always works.

228
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,750
The terms you both offered are good.

229
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,120
Actually, I want them all.

230
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,240
Is it possible

231
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,270
for both of you to work for me?

232
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,390
I'd gain an extra boost then.

233
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
- No way.
- No way.

234
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,480
It seems Mr. Hou

235
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,440
wasn't taken advantage of too badly.

236
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,470
To be honest,

237
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,150
I can trust

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,390
neither of you.

239
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,550
Since you're so hesitant,

240
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,080
I'll make a choice for you.

241
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,750
Though it's about doing business,

242
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,120
you can't just come and leave

243
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,240
whenever you want.

244
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,200
I am Party A.

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,840
I want to do business

246
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,000
with both of you.

247
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,590
It's okay.

248
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,440
Only one can be alive.

249
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,280
Mr. Xu,

250
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,120
you didn't choose just now,

251
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,320
so you can't blame me now

252
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
for leaving you with no choice.

253
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,840
We'll have to see

254
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,240
what you're capable of.

255
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,640
Let's make it clear first.

256
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I have to get

257
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,390
the thing in his hands first.

258
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,630
Only then will his life be yours.

259
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,030
The money is hidden

260
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,550
in a locker at Leyun Gym.

261
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,930
- Enter.
- What's wrong?

262
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,550
You and Liu Ming go check

263
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,910
the car with the tail number 4722.

264
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,110
Copy that.

265
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,470
Liu Ming,

266
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,510
field work.

267
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,920
Let's go.

268
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
When strangled to this extent,

269
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,200
it'll only take 12 hours

270
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,030
for his nerves to die.

271
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,630
Which locker is it exactly?

272
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
Zone A.

273
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,390
2345.

274
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,030
The password

275
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,910
is 345751.

276
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,200
The round trip takes 3 hours.

277
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,390
We need to hurry.

278
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,270
Hou Liangyuan,

279
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,440
if I lose my leg,

280
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll fight you to the bitter end.

281
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,790
If this USB drive isn't decrypted

282
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,240
before the money isn't retrieved,

283
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,510
you know what your fate will be, right?

284
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,190
Cheers.

285
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

286
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,850
It's a car with a cloned plate.

287
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,550
The trail has gone cold again.

288
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,550
You didn't expect that, did you?

289
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,310
You did so much.

290
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,030
They still don't believe you.

291
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,880
Hurry up.

292
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,920
I still want to keep this leg.

293
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,750
Why must he

294
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,270
solve problems with violence?

295
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,920
Can you crack it or not?

296
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,200
36 cm.

297
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,910
36 cm.

298
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,100
Captain He,
the village secretary is here.

299
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,630
Record this.

300
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,670
Seal it off.

301
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,110
How was it discovered?

302
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,960
The rainstorm some time ago

303
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,540
might've washed away the soil.

304
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,850
When the kids came to play,

305
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,590
they discovered it.

306
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,440
So,

307
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,510
we called the police.

308
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Can you tell me

309
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,440
what the situation is with this family?

310
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,160
Their surname is Hou.

311
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,310
The couple had died long ago.

312
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,550
They had only one son
named Hou Liangyuan.

313
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,310
Over a decade ago, he went out to work

314
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,270
and never came back.

315
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,510
This house has been vacant ever since.

316
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,790
Does Hou Liangyuan have

317
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,920
any other relatives?

318
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,440
Just his parents and him.

319
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,200
His father was named Hou Guanhuang.

320
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,350
A native of the village.

321
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,790
His mother came from another village.

322
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,310
Her name...

323
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,150
Jiang Yumei.

324
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,160
Yes.

325
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,960
She came
from the neighboring Lujia Village.

326
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,960
What is the relationship

327
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,220
between Jiang Yumei and Jiang Yongquan?

328
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,240
Jiang Yumei is Jiang Yongquan's aunt.

329
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,590
Do you know more

330
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,440
about Hou Liangyuan?

331
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,000
Well,

332
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,070
when he was 18,

333
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,410
he had a serious illness.

334
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
After that, he became fat.

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,020
Was he very thin before?

336
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,750
Not thin, just average.

337
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,280
Disgusting?

338
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,310
Don't listen to their principles.

339
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,920
One used to be a teacher;

340
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,440
one studied abroad.

341
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,160
In the end, they fell

342
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,240
into my hands.

343
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,720
Once under my command,

344
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,400
you must work steadily

345
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,500
and devote yourself to me.

346
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,880
If you're beyond control,

347
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,000
I'd rather kill you.

348
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,670
Am I right or not?

349
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,670
Right.

350
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,110
In this world,

351
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,350
there's no one you can trust.

352
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,310
You can only trust yourself.

353
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,790
They're like a pair of pet dogs,

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,350
locked in a cage.

355
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,040
In the end,

356
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,350
they will bite each other

357
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,200
to stay alive.

358
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,640
Can we still make it out alive?

359
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,760
Are you scared?

360
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,110
You know this better than I do.

361
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,790
You helped me control them.

362
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,110
Do you remember when you first arrived?

363
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,720
You weren't like this.

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
This is the key to the room.

365
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,440
Keep a close watch on them.

366
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,510
Don't let me down.

367
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,830
Have you cracked it?

368
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,200
The computer is handling

369
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,110
the rest.

370
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Chef.

371
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,720
Hacker.

372
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,920
Biologist.

373
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,240
So much expertise.

374
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,270
Knowledge is just an illusion
created by humans.

375
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,400
It becomes boring
after you understand it.

376
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,400
Knowledge is not just

377
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,270
an understanding of things.

378
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,550
More importantly,
it is the insight into humans.

379
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
You look

380
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,720
quite disappointed.

381
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,550
You're such a genius.

382
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,790
Why not do something better?

383
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,270
What a pity.

384
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,510
When a person

385
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,720
encounters a beast,

386
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,310
no matter who dies,

387
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,640
it is the law of nature.

388
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,070
But when they are placed

389
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,960
inside a cage

390
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,440
and forced to kill,

391
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,830
the cruel truth

392
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,400
just emerges.

393
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,790
Your point is

394
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,270
that violence itself is not cruel.

395
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,790
What is cruel is

396
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,640
the collective violence

397
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,200
after a set of rules is established.

398
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,550
So, what I want to do is

399
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,350
kill all the rules.

400
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,550
You just want

401
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,960
the right to interpret the rules.

402
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,400
Have you found the exact location?

403
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
Based on the tracker

404
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,200
you hid in Xu's amulet,

405
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
the exact location is

406
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,950
(Location captured)
in the Guanghua Road area.

407
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,190
Most buildings are abandoned.

408
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,590
(Safe travels)
Captain He,

409
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,920
why send Xu to be the undercover?

410
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,270
Why didn't you tell me?

411
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,040
Sit.

412
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,630
Continue.

413
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,070
The DNA results are out.

414
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,030
It's Hou Liangyuan.

415
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,350
The Hou Liangyuan now

416
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,510
is actually Jiang Yongquan,

417
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,550
the culprit at large

418
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,740
of the "8·19" trafficking case

419
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
30 years ago.

420
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,820
So, after Jiang Yongquan

421
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,460
(Identity: Hou Liangyuan)
fled that year,

422
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,500
he went to his aunt's home

423
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,610
and somehow became

424
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,510
his cousin,

425
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,440
Hou Liangyuan.

426
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,310
How did

427
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,440
the real Hou Liangyuan die?

428
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,310
We're still waiting

429
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,300
for the result from M.E.

430
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,350
Are you sure it's Jiang Yongquan?

431
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,790
It's a perfect match.

432
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,800
It is Jiang Yongquan.

433
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,210
It's finally confirmed.

434
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,240
Xu Jingzhi

435
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,030
was abducted to Lujia Village.

436
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,720
The main abductor

437
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,270
is Jiang Yongquan.

438
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
Don't you have anyone you hate?

439
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,440
You'd hate them so much

440
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,160
that you'd want to kill them.

441
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,280
No.

442
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,350
Lu Ran told me

443
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,780
you were abducted there

444
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,170
when you were a kid.

445
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,880
Don't you hate

446
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,720
the abductor?

447
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,880
Not worth it.

448
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,200
Growing up has always been

449
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
a painful process.

450
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,720
Hatred

451
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,160
is not the only coping method,

452
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,270
nor should it be the driving force

453
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,790
for people like us to keep on living.

454
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,440
So, during that period,

455
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,640
was there nothing worth your nostalgia?

456
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,720
At least, there were things

457
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,160
that were both special and fun.

458
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,200
For example,

459
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,790
in an unfamiliar environment,

460
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,440
you could become good friends with a dog

461
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,350
and play some thrilling games

462
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,930
that involve jaywalking.

463
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,680
You could even raise

464
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,550
a paranoid monster.

465
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,070
I was abducted
while eating lamb chop noodles.

466
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,070
Then I was sold to Lujia Village.

467
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,750
The man in that family was Lu Youcheng.

468
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,640
I still like eating lamb chop noodles.

469
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,070
Four times a month.

470
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,070
I was too young at that time.

471
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,440
I let you test Wu Min

472
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,400
with the rice cake she hates the most

473
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,790
to see if she was really crazy,

474
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,160
but I overlooked

475
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,440
the psychological harm it'd cause you.

476
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,440
In Lujia Village,

477
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,400
Wu Min has always protected you.

478
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,150
She let me

479
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,030
escape safely.

480
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,960
If only I weren't there.

481
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,350
Have you ever thought

482
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,000
about killing me?

483
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,310
If we can get out alive...

484
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,940
(Zone A)

485
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,660
(Zhen Yuandao)

486
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,420
(File Folder)

487
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,920
This is the surprise you mentioned.

488
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,790
It seems our understanding of surprises

489
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,440
is quite different.

490
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,310
He told me

491
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,750
that you need multiple identities

492
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,880
as a precaution.

493
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,240
What is this for?

494
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,200
It can open a room worth 30 million.

495
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,850
Address?

496
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,440
My leg feels uncomfortable.

497
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,270
Your leg is fine.

498
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
You're just hungry.

499
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,830
You can even starve for another week.

500
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,070
Wasn't Xu Yi's clubhouse

501
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,440
sealed off?

502
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,720
I can still get in.

503
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,640
What am I going there to look for?

504
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,790
You alone can put it there.

505
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,720
So, it's definitely not cash.

506
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,160
A suitcase.

507
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,790
1,000 bank cards.

508
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,720
Xu Yi laundered the money

509
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,110
with the clumsiest method.

510
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,880
30,000 on one card.

511
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,830
No one checks.

512
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,000
Then I'll send someone again.

513
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,790
If it's still

514
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,790
this kind of surprise,

515
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,190
I don't have

516
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,960
your sense

517
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,800
of humor.

518
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,560
Hou,

519
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,590
it's been found.

520
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,880
He's given me what I want.

521
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,590
Have you decrypted the USB drive?

522
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,510
The deal is over.

523
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,070
We each take what we need.

524
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,000
You've fallen into my hands.

525
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,200
Now, you are

526
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,920
under my control.

527
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,430
And you.

528
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,150
Take the computer.

529
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
Did you get the USB drive?

530
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,630
On the surface,

531
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,850
I don't have an identity

532
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,030
to approach Hou Liangyuan.

533
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,030
(Three days ago)

534
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,870
I do.

535
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,960
Your appearance increases credibility.

536
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,440
After it's done,

537
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,600
we each take what we need.

538
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,920
You'd better make good use of me.

539
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,260
Nice to work with you.

540
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,170
Nice to work with you.

541
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,630
You're half-siblings.

542
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,320
Though you have different surnames,

543
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,840
it's not hard to investigate you.

544
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,760
What do you want me to do?

545
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,760
First,

546
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,360
give this to Hou Liangyuan.

547
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,730
I'll go find him in several days.

548
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,110
Try to install the listening device

549
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,010
(Bill; Recorder: Zhao Xueli)
in his office.

550
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,390
Second,

551
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,590
after I enter the resort,

552
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,320
stop his lackeys from searching me.

553
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,960
Try to hand this over to me.

554
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,950
Be smart.

555
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,330
Don't let anyone find out.

556
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,150
Third,

557
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,670
send Hou Liangyuan

558
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,070
to his

559
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,320
secret passage.

560
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,280
Hou is strict.

561
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,800
How will you get in?

562
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,630
That has nothing to do with you.

563
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,440
Fourth,

564
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,920
find someone in the resort

565
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,150
to work for me.

566
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,030
Do you understand?

567
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,710
What did your helper leave you?

568
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,030
What's going on?

569
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,510
This is ruthless.

570
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,820
(Start)

571
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:49,531
♪Wandering in the dark cave♪

572
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:55,201
♪The cries turn into false words
amid doubt♪

573
00:36:55,891 --> 00:37:00,171
