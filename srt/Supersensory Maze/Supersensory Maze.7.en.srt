I'm so proud of you, Ran.

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,670
You got first place this time.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,160
Dig in.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,390
You love

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,510
Mom's dumplings, don't you?

6
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,240
Why are you looking at me?

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,920
I told you,

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,240
don't give me that look!

15
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,400
passed through

16
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,630
the River...

17
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,470
of Forgetfulness

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,080
and accidentally entered

19
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,240
the Women's Kingdom,

20
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
where only women live,

21
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,120
no men at all.

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
Their arrival

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,080
ended the Women's Kingdom.

He drank from the Mother River

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,000
and got pregnant instantly.

26
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,310

(Zhao Xiaozhe)

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Kiddo,

33
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,400
you've got so many comics.

34
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
Yeah, very cheap,

35
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,280
two yuan each.

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,680
If I buy them all,

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
can you throw in something extra?

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
Sure, just pick whatever you want.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me take a look.

40
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,190
What do you have here?

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,430
Let's see...

42
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
This handkerchief is nice.

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Can I have it?

44
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,420
I can wipe my sweat

45
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,270
while working out.

46
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,800
Sure, no problem.

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,560
Okay, deal.

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Thank you.

49
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,160
Anyone want comics?

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,950
Very cheap, two yuan each.

51
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,950
What exactly are the police asking about?

52
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,270
You'd better explain yourself.

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,190
Those were all Mr. Xu's requests.

54
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,310
I thought you also...

55
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,720
Since when does Xu Yi speak for me?

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,390
I entrusted you with

57
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,240
an important school.

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,800
Can you answer me?

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,870
What about the students?

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,240
If I hadn't come,

61
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,720
I wouldn't have known you were

62
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,800
doing all this behind my back,

63
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,070
using charity to cover up your deals.

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,310
This is illegal!

65
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,360
Ms. Liang, it's not that bad.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
I only sent the girls

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,870
to Mr. Xu's clubhouse.

68
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,630
The police won't find anything.

69
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
How many benefits did Xu Yi give you

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
to mess with your head?

71
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,470
- Ms. Liang...
- Shut up!

72
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,160
The police will be here soon.

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Listen,

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,720
keep your mouth shut.

75
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,190
Once this gets out,

76
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,190
you won't get away!

77
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,190
Officer,

78
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,430
these are files of

79
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,430
Wu Xinxin and Liu Wanyao.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
Two grades apart.

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,190
Were they close?

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
Honestly, I don't know

83
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,270
how students get along.

84
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,680
Our training program

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
is two years.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
They shouldn't know each other.

87
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,190
What about after graduation?

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
Do you have

89
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,560
any current information on them?

90
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,590
Well...

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,750
I do want to cooperate, but...

92
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,270
But the file system

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,390
wasn't well-managed before I came.

94
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,950
Aside from these,

95
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,270
we really have nothing.

96
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,630
You're not the rude type.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,720
Pretending not to know is also a form of

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,070
self-protection.

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
They have no

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
physical contact,

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,460
(Liu Wanyao and Wu Xinxin
actively join community service.)

102
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
but their bodies

103
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,160
are leaning toward each other.

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,310
Their expressions

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,560
and posture look relaxed.

106
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,120
"Wu Xinxin and Liu Wanyao

107
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,160
not only knew each other, but were close."

108
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,240
Is that what you want to say?

109
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,630
This reminds me of Zhang Yutong and Wang Chen.

110
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,680
Is it out of jealousy,

111
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,430
protection, or something else?

112
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,000
So, another case with a hidden relationship.

113
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,800
I need to start over.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Xu Jingzhi,

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
if I were only your captain,

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
I'd tell you that

117
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,190
you're not the only one on this case.

118
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,800
Can't crack cases without you?

119
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,920
The world's not spinning?

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I... I get it.

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
I know we don't

122
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
do heroism anymore.

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
- But I know...
- We don't need sacrifices

124
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,750
to raise the clearance rate,

125
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,600
right?

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,510
You have your own rules.

127
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,430
Without me, you'd be

128
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,680
more comfortable, right?

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,160
I told you, humor isn't your thing.

130
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,680
I've got to crack it!

131
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
He Ya.

132
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
He Ya!

Sir,

136
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,190
have you seen this person?

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,480
No, I haven't.

138
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,320
Thanks.

139
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,830
Have you seen this person?

140
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,040
No.

No.

Excuse me,

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,870
have you seen this person?

145
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,710
No.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,870
Don't point at me.

147
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,550
I'm fine.

148
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,630

No,

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
still not right.

Forensics just called.

155
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
At the scene, Liu Wanyao had more blood loss

than a fatal amount.

(Jinmengwan Clubhouse)

158
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,480
Pull it up.

00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,920
Can't you smile?

How's the shot?

164
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,270
They're new. Haven't a clue.

165
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,110
Come on.

166
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
Go, take the shot.

167
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
Keep shooting.

168

Who put you on Zhao Xueli?

170
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,240
What do you want with his son?

171
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,910
Wasn't it your boss who sent you?

172
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,440
Just do what I said!

173
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,550
You've crossed the line now.

174
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,480
If you dare mess up the boss's plans,

175
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,480
I'll be the first to kill you.

176
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,600
You really think

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
you're being loyal?

178
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,720
Let me tell you,

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,390
you've already become

180
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,630
a problem for your boss.

181
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
The police will find you soon!

182
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,840
I hate people like you

183
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,480
who think they know everything.

184
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,390
If you want to protect her,

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,670
you'd better listen to me.

186
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,600
What are you doing here?

187
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,150
You tell me.

188
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,750
What have you done behind my back?

189
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
What have you done

190
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,320
with my school?

191
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,180
I worked so hard

192
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,140
to build that school.

193
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,910
How could you use it for dirty business?

194
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,510
I'm dirty?

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,550
Dirtier than the photos of you

196
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,510
and your side piece?

197
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,320
Fine, I admit it.

198
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,150
It was my fault.

199
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,720
But those girls are innocent.

200
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,870
They came to our school

201
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,600
hoping for a normal life.

202
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
How could you

203
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,910
send them to hell?

204
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,440
And whose fault is that?

205
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,280
What do you mean?

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,910
If you hadn't helped

207
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,750
Mai launder money,

208
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,790
they wouldn't be after me.

209
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,910
I admit it's all my fault, okay?

210
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,480
Those girls are innocent.

211
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,840
How about this?

212
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,720
We take the ledgers and turn ourselves in.

213
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,720
I really don't have the ledgers.

214
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,080
If I had them,

215
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,240
why would I take photos?

216
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,910
These ledgers

217
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,240
were made by Zhao Xueli and Hu Bo

218
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,600
to protect themselves.

219
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,790
Mai Boyuan wants to clean his image.

220
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,240
We can't look out for ourselves now.

221
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,390
No ledgers,

222
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,750
no proof.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,270
I'll be the only one going to jail

224
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,480
and they'll walk free.

225
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,630
That's not fair.

226
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,600
What should we do now?

227
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,320
First, you find a way

228
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,550
to close the school

229
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,430
and act like

230
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,870
you know nothing about that mess.

231
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,670
I have several pieces of footage

232
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,240
of Mai's boss raping those girls.

233
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,670
Once I trade the footage for money,

234
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,840
we'll leave the country.

235
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,510
And once we're abroad,

236
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
I'll hand the footage over

237
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,510
to the police.

238
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,100
(Police)

239
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,440
There are many ways

240
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,320
to figure out a puzzle.

241
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,960
There's no easy way
to figure out the human heart.

242
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,320
Why didn't you tell me

243
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
Lu Youliang came to you?

244
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,150
Can you learn to trust people?

245
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,910
I only trust you.

(Goji berries)

247
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,510
Mr. Mai,

248
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
I've got some stock...

249
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm telling you,

250
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,400
don't bring this up again.

251
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm done with anything

252
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
related to this.

253
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,000
Mr. Mai,

254
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,550
hold off on saying no.

255
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,200
Check the quality first.

256
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,920
You need to find a way

257
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,440
to run something legal.

258
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm quite busy.

259
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,550
If it's nothing important,

260
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
don't call me.

261
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,950
Mr. Mai...

262
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,270
So, you want to touch it too?

263
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,920
No... no.

264
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,160
You think I don't know?

265
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
I really don't.

266
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,350
Did Mai Boyuan

267
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,350
send you here?

268
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,040
Hou,

269
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,150
I...

270
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
This hand

271
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
wanted to touch my woman.

272
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,920
Make this the bait.

273
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,750
No. Wait, Hou, I didn't say anything.

274
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,160
Hou, give me a chance!

275
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,790
Hou! Hou! Hou!

276
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,590
Hou!

(Requirements for Forensic Inspection Record)

280
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,040
Come in.

281
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,430
Director Feng,

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
we found a safe

283
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,030
in the crawl space

284
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,200
under Hu Bo's bed.

285
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,550
There are ledgers inside.

286
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,390
Ledgers?

287
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,790
Copies of Hu Bo's

288
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,510
project records over the years.

289
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,550
Economic Crimes Unit checked them.

290
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,200
No issues on the books,

291
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,960
but we still don't know

292
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,920
why he kept these.

293
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,960
There's also an empty safe.

294
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,110
We suspect

295
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,440
some ledgers were hidden.

296
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,550
Don't forget, there is

297
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,960
a lot of Liu Wanyao's blood in his home.

298
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,590
The priority now

299
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,880
is finding the second victim.

300
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,350
We've stationed people

301
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,400
at hospitals and clinics.

302
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,030
So far, no news.

303
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,960
Alright, got it. Get back to work.

304
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,800
Yes, sir.

305
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,310
So, Zhuang Mingcheng

306
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,750
set me up with you, huh?

307
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,760
Cut the crap.

308
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,720
When the show's over,

309
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,960
give me the ledgers.

310
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,440
As long as you do what we say,

311
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,680
Mr. Zhao stays safe.

312
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,640
We'll give you the ledgers.

313
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,560
There's no festival.

314
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,720
Who's setting off fireworks?

315
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,160
Fireworks are banned here, right?

316
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,680
Let's go check.

317
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,760
Shi Zelin?

318
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,590
Didn't expect you here.

319
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,910
He Ya.

320
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,240
Thanks.

321
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,030
What a coincidence.

322
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,870
Officer He,

323
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,190
having dinner here?

324
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,800
Yeah.

325
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,240
Are you working here

326
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,560
so late?

327
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,200
I need to find Ge Feifei during the day,

328
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,350
so I do delivery work

329
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,480
to these stores at night.

330
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,960
What happened to her?

331
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,750
She went missing after being released.

332
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,790
Everyone says she ran off with someone.

333
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,030
But I know Feifei.

334
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,960
She can't do that.

335
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,070
There must be a reason.

336
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,910
Don't worry.

337
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,640
I'll look out for you.

338
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,400
Thank you, Officer He.

339
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,240
Did you have dinner?

340
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,350
Yes, I did.

341
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,440
If you didn't, you can

342
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,400
have some with us.

343
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,750
I really did. Please go ahead.

344
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,720
Okay, I'll finish it.

345
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,430
Take care.

346
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,520
Be good.

347
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,390
What did he do?

348
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,190
Drugs.

349
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,200
Screwed by a friend back home.

350
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,830
He's actually an honest guy.

351
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,160
It's hard to quit an addiction.

352
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,520
Is he clean now?

353
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,720
Yes.

354
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,750
His addiction is gone.

355
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,110
But he just told me

356
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,110
his childhood sweetheart

357
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,950
is missing.

358
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,510
Childhood sweetheart?

359
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,920
Then he has to find her.

360
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,590
Anyone here?

361
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,510
Who set off the fireworks?

362
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,760
Liu Ming,

363
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,870
let's go check.

364
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,640
Who set off the fireworks?

365
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,420
(Hu Bo)

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,070
Nail holes in the head.

367
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,200
Based on the DNA test,

368
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,040
the deceased

369
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,270
is Hu Bo.

370
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,510
Due to the special

371
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,880
(DNA Identification Report)
carnivorous bacteria,

372
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,880
the body underwent

373
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,960
severe skeletonization.

374
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,270
Carnivorous bacteria?

375
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,070
This is the bacterial sample

376
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,240
we extracted from the body.

377
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,160
(Phage)
It's not a common wild strain.

378
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,110
The deceased had

379
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,350
nails driven in multiple places.

380
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,510
They're quite deep.

381
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,070
Some even left marks

382
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,920
on the bones.

383
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,590
Hu Bo had something

384
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,960
the murderer wanted.

385
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,400
Such torture was meant to extract information.

386
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,830
The hatred runs deep.

387
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,060
From the traces we've confirmed,

388
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,920
we can prove

389
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,240
that at least before

390
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,000
half the nails were driven in,

391
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,070
Hu Bo was still alive.

392
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,800
Well...

393
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,310
Can I say something here?

394
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,280
Of course, go ahead.

395
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,880
None of the nails

396
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,270
hit fatal spots.

397
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,720
The murderer at least knows human anatomy.

398
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,310
Li Long,

399
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,750
take a team and go to Hu Bo's hometown.

400
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,350
Yin Wei, continue on

401
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,240
Liu Wanyao's trail.

402
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,590
Liu Ming, Xu Jingzhi,

403
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,550
check his social relations.

404
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,670
Captain He,

406
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,400
Liu Ming and I will

407
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,070
go to Hu Bo's company at 1 PM.

408
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,070
I want to take a leave for a personal errand.

409
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,240
What kind of errand?

410
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,350
I want to visit Aunt Min.

411
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,070
Ride with me.

412
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,040
I have a car.

413
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,840
Ride in your car, then.

414
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,880
You don't have to go.

415
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,070
Then you're going secretly?

416
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,790
Don't get it everywhere.

417
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,200
Wanna have a bite?

418
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
No. No.

419
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,430
This snack's got

420
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,200
walnuts, cranberries, and sesame.

421
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,440
Just take a bite.

422
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,350
No. I'm driving here.

423
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,270
Alright, drive safely.

424
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,900
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

425
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,060
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

426
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,900
(Liu Wanyao)

427
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,440
The show with Ding Chuan

428
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,280
is over.

429
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,680
Now,

430
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,310
it's time for Zhao Xueli to pay.

431
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,590
Mr. Xu, I'm here.

432
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm on my way. See you at the entrance.

433
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,390
Okay.

434
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,140
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

435
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
Why are you looking at me?

436
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,110
I told you,

437
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,590
don't give me that look!

438
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,980
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

439
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,110
Lu Ran has been gone for years.

440
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,240
What if he hadn't?

441
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,760
Has Lu Youliang been released recently?

442
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,920
Perhaps. I haven't seen him.

443
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,720
From the wax figure case

444
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,030
to Hu Bo's case today,

445
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,960
everything feels strange.

446
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
If you know something...

447
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,760
If I know something

448
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,640
or think of something,

449
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
I'll let you know.

450
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,750
This afternoon, I'll go near

451
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,590
Hu Bo's home

452
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,790
to see if there are new clues.

453
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,720
From the movements, the Hu Bo

454
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,920
we tracked wasn't the real one.

455
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,480
Posture and movement

456
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,320
don't lie.

457
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,270
Photos aren't reliable.

458
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,780
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

459
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,480
Before Hu Bo went missing, was there

460
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,920
anything unusual?

461
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,240
He was always late, left work early,

462
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,590
and sloppy at work.

463
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,110
That was just how he was.

464
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,310
I didn't notice anything unusual.

465
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,280
He was always like that.

466
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,000
Zhao Xueli was his direct supervisor

467
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,960
and didn't say anything.

468
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,750
I heard the company's major shareholder

469
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,590
is his uncle.

470
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,200
His wife is gentle and obedient.

471
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,110
He's a total jerk.

472
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,110
Do you know the specifics

473
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,270
of the Angel Training Center

474
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,720
he managed? What did they do?

475
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,790
Technically, that project should've been mine,

476
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,000
but Mr. Zhao

477
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,550
took it directly.

478
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,200
There must be something

479
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
going on between them.

480
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,590
He wasn't popular.

481
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,430
Nobody liked him.

482
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
And for some unknown reason,

483
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,480
Mr. Zhao gave him many projects.

484
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Could this project

485
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,510
relate to Hu Bo

486
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,880
killing his wife?

487
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,030
Who did he

488
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,830
have conflicts with at work?

489
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,830
It's not something I can talk about.

490
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,240
But he was hostile to me.

491
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,310
The girls didn't like him.

492
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,000
He harassed me.

493
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,040
I rejected him.

494
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,680
Otherwise, I might've ended up

495
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
in the freezer.

496
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,550
We get along well.

497
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,720
Same hometown as you?

498
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,270
Yeah. Same hometown, bad luck.

499
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,550
Where did Hu Bo come from?

500
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,760
Yannan County.

501
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,240
Tell that guy to stop filming.

502
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,440
Not without my permission.

503
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,190
Tell him to delete it.

504
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,440
Do you have a year-end party every year?

505
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,350
Any footage?

506
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,750
All of it.

507
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,070
(Xu Jingzhi)
Call me when Mr. Zhao's back.

508
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,070
Okay.

509
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,910
Mr. Xu,

510
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,640
I've asked their colleagues

511
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,680
several times before.

512
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,430
What they say today is totally different.

513
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,830
These people are so unpredictable.

514
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,510
Hello? Captain He,

515
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,720
check the underground parking lot

516

of Wuyang Xincheng.

517
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,350
There might be a surprise.

518
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,190
