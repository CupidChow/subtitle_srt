00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,980
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,760
Do you know who I am?

4
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,000
I want you to keep walking forward

5
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,760
in your new life.

6
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,280
I don't want to be the one

7
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
who makes you look back.

8
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,840
You're still as hypocritical

9
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,760
as when you were a kid.

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,790
Why?

11
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,740
Why didn't you just keep pretending?

12
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,350
"Hypocritical" is your word.

13
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,640
I'm protecting myself.

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,680
I'm reminding myself:

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,070
Once I forget my parents

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,710
and the life I had,

17
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll never be able to return.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,560
Do I remind you

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,150
of the time

20
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,560
you were abducted?

21
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,590
Are you dodging

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,150
that shameful past?

23
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,710
I admit it.

24
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,310
I thought I'd forget

25
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,150
and throw the pain away.

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,840
But it's still here.

27
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,910
It never left.

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,190
Does it hurt you?

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,280
I've never been

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,590
the person you wanted.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,150
I looked after you,

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,400
became a cop,

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,280
tried to fix other people's crises

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,630
because

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,030
I was powerless

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
against my own.

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
Lu Ran,

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,000
have you ever killed someone?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,750
Lu Ran?

40
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,540
(Grand Opening)

41
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,420
Longyuan Group

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
has always upheld

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,590
the principle

44
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,000
of benefiting society.

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,530
Through its charity program,

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
it donated 200,000 yuan worth

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,080
of new uniforms, computers,

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,590
and school supplies to the 74 pupils

49
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,910
of Liangbu Primary School

50
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,030
in Lushi Town.

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,910
We hope every child

52
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,360
will grow up grateful

53
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,600
and one day repay their hometown

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,190
and society.

55
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,160
Thank you, everyone.

56
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,000
Captain He, the signal jammer

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,870
has been installed.

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,950
We can move any time.

59
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,230
Okay.

60
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,430
Huiyue Commercial Center

61
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,070
is officially open.

62
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,160
I know.

63
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,720
I still have some paperwork unfinished.

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,370
Once the goods reach abroad,

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
they need to be cashed out fast.

66
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,510
Find me a channel.

67
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,430
How is this a threat?

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
Ms. Liang,

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,430
we're friends.

70
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,270
You...

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,390
Please help me out.

72
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,820
(See you at the old place
at 10 tonight.)

73
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,040
30 million for real?

74
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,120
Xu Yi's original target

75
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,160
was 30 million.

76
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,040
What did he actually get?

77
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,670
3 million.

78
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,630
I really regret

79
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,630
not installing a camera in there

80
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,510
to see Hou Liangyuan's face now.

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
Why did you help Zhao Xin?

82
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,430
Because she was pitiful.

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240
Did you help Liu Wanyao

84
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,430
also because she was pitiful?

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
Liu Wanyao isn't dead.

86
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,160
Do you remember the old days?

87
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,830
You taught me so much.

88
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,220
(Perfect crime)

89
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,980
(Unrelated, officially non-existent)

90
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,960
(Step into one's blind spot,
exploit their mind)

91
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,190
Create an alibi.

92
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,800
(Invisible in the case)
Form

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,420
(The impossible culprit)
a shared empathy

94
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
with others.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Yuan,

96
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,040
do you believe

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
a perfect crime is possible?

98
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,390
How dare he mess with me?

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,040
Bring me my new ID papers.

100
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,720
The ledger, too.

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,310
Meet me in the tunnel later.

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Got it.

103
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,040
During the ribbon-cutting,

104
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,560
Mrs. Li told me

105
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,430
a foreign businessman

106
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,950
is hosting a private banquet tomorrow

107
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,190
up on East Hill.

108
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,430
He is

109
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,160
an art investor

110
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,310
from Country S,

111
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,520
an overseas Chinese,

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,510
back to visit relatives

113
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,510
and scout

114
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,270
for promising partnerships.

115
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,030
Lots of art dealers will be there.

116
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,600
We have to go.

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
We've got experience

118
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,480
in art trading.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,000
A clear edge.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Exactly.

121
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,630
Shall I pick you

122
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,790
a nice gift?

123
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,270
Cost doesn't matter.

124
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,790
I've neglected you lately

125
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,000
because of Hou Liangyuan.

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,240
Your birthday's coming up.

127
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,670
I'll make it up to you.

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,200
You actually remembered.

129
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,230
It's okay.

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
As long as I stay by your side,

131
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,910
I'm content.

132
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm the one who can't leave you.

133
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,150
Oh, stop it.

134
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,660
(SWAT)

135
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,580
(Danger; Do not approach)

136
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,180
(Danger; Do not approach)

137
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,980
(In the target area)

138
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Come out.

139
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,710
Come out!

140
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,590
Don't kill me.

141
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,260
I'm not one of them.

142
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,860
- Stay back!
- Talk slowly; calm down.

143
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,730
I'm a cop.

144
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,670
I was abducted, too.

145
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,270
I'm one of the girls they took.

146
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,420
Hou Liangyuan and his gang
split up and ran.

147
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,060
The greenhouse.

148
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,220
The greenhouse is full

149
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,030
of girls like me.

150
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,080
They're tied up.

151
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,630
I'll take you; come on!

152
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,790
We have to hurry!

153
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Suspect fleeing toward the road.

154
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
Team 2, assist.

155
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,510
Roger.

156
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,550
Afraid the cops will arrest me?

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,910
Hand me the USB drive.

158
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,850
What will happen after?

159
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,600
Live by the law.

160
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,080
You betrayed

161
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,270
the rules of our game.

162
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,390
I should've known

163
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,750
you'd never

164
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,030
give up your choice so easily.

165
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,080
The cops came at the right time.

166
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,550
It seems

167
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,550
that Hou Liangyuan

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,000
never got a surprise.

169
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,480
He got a death warrant.

170
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,840
Give me the USB drive.

171
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,420
It's your chance at a lighter sentence.

172
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,840
Did you ever give me a chance?

173
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
In all my life,

174
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,670
have you ever chosen me?

175
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,870
Then why am I even here?

176
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,270
You've crossed the line.

177
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,790
You only want evidence.

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm not as stupid as Hou Liangyuan.

179
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,720
Tell me what I have to do

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
to make you turn back.

181
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,960
Take off my uniform

182
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
and drop my name like you?

183
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,630
Is that the result you want?

184
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,240
That's right.

185
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,710
Lu Ran,

186
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
grow up and think.

187
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,710
Yuan.

188
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,440
You still have hope.

189
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,340
Let's go now.

190
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,780
(Zhen Yuandao)

191
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,750
Where's the ledger?

192
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,200
I panicked and forgot it.

193
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
I'll run back.

194
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,130
You head down first.

195
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,150
Cops are everywhere.

196
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,080
Be careful.

197
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,920
Don't worry.

198
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,780
I won't drag you down.

199
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,630
Good brother.

200
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
Yin Wei,

201
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
where are you?

202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,000
Near the dock.

203
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,940
We just arrested a few.

204
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,080
Hurry over.

205
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,510
Lots of girls are trapped here.

206
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,630
Hurry.

207
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,790
Are you here to save us?

208
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,910
We'll get you out.

209
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,910
You have to get us out!

210
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,320
Guo Zhixin?

211
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,960
Guo Zhixin!

212
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
Hou,

213
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
sorry.

214
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,560
My little brother matters more.

Come closer, and I'll kill you.

224

Zhuang Mingcheng.

225
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,830
How did you get in?

226
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,310
I crawled back from hell

227
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
to collect your soul.

228
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,400
I never thought

229
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,320
I'd get to walk

230
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
your last mile

231
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,200
with you.

232
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,590
What do you want?

233
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,160
We can cut a deal.

234
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,480
Looks like Mr. Jiang

235
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
really forgot me.

236
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,480
In Lujia Village back then,

237
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,590
I was your masterpiece

238
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,200
in human sales.

239
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,100

Come on.

243
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,550
Name your price.

244
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,830
I can afford anything.

245
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,030
You can't.

246
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,880
I only sold a few people.

247
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,790
I'll do the time.

248
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,790
I've got evidence on Mai Boyuan.

249
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,680
He was a part of this.

250
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
I'll tell the cops everything.

251
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
I am

252
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
starting

253
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,920
to like you.

254
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,480
We can talk.

255
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,440
Right now,

256
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,510
let's play a game.

257
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,750
You're under my control now.

258
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,680
(Hou Liangyuan,)

259
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,750
(you're just another piece)

260
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,550
(on the chessboard.)

261
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
Where's He Ya?

262
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,080
Xu,

263
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,390
are you okay?

264
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,680
Where's He Ya?

265
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,590
Mr. Xu, are you okay?

266
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,680
She took some injured girls

267
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,520
to the hospital.

268
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,550
Any sign of Hou Liangyuan?

269
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,080
No. The signal was cut out.

270
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,590
Where is the last location?

271
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,000
Near the resort lobby.

272
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
That way.

273
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,580
(Goods delivered.)

274
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,830
Are you feeling unwell?

275
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,410
Have you found Hou Liangyuan?

276
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,960
A girl says there's a tunnel

277
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,510
- in the greenhouse.
- Liu Ming.

278
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,350
The resort tunnel

279
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,190
is in the greenhouse.

280
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
You two, head back.

281
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll be fine.

282
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,560
Liu Ming.

283
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,910
Mr. Xu.

284
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,240
Mr. Xu?

285
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,240
Liu Ming!

286
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,800
Take this

287
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,510
to Captain He.

288
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,150
Give it to her,

289
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,350
not anyone else.

290
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,270
What about you?

291
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,110
Go!

292
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,550
All this fuss for a suburb.

293
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,640
Why?

294
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,510
Routine check. Please cooperate.

295
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,400
Sure, sure.

296
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
Thanks.

297
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,180
Where did you come from?

298
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,320
Just over there.

299
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,070
Pop the trunk, please.

300
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,400
Hello, spot check.

301
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,950
Licenses of the driver and the vehicle.

302
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,160
What's going on?

303
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,000
Let's go.

304
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,350
Keep away from him.

305
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Don't go that way.

306
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,790
Should we call 120?

307
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,630
Sure.

308
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,310
Who is that?

309
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,250
Such a serious injury.

310
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,800
Help...

311
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,880
Help me.

312
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,410
He's covered in blood.

313
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,350
Help me.

314
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,750
Everyone, move back.

315
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Step back.

316
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,930
Step back.

317
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,310
Stop filming.

318
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,480
Step back; stop filming.

319
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,240
Phones down. Step back.

320
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:29,420
(Emergency)

321
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,320
(Where are you?)

322
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,760
(Are you back?)

323
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,370
(I just left the hospital,)

324
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,390
(heading back now.)

325
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,480
(The girls have been settled.)

326
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:56,540
(Wuyang Express)

327
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,340
(Interview Room)

328
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,190
Liu,

329
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,010
I'm here for the report.

330
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,590
Yin Wei.

331
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,620
Director Feng.

332
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Have you seen Xu Jingzhi?

333
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,960
He didn't come back with you?

334
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,440
He said the job isn't done,

335
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,450
and he knows how to get
the USB drive back.

336
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,430
Mr. Xu,

337
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,320
I forgot to tell you

338
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,160
that I moved again.

339
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,830
I've given the ledger to the police.

340
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,190
What?

341
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,550
Are you calling me

342
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,590
because you miss me?

343
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,920
You know exactly why I called.

344
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Sorry.

345
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm not turning myself in.

346
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,840
By the way,

347
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
I forgot to tell you

348
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,700
that Captain He won't have dinner

349
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,940
with you tonight.

350
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,030
How about a little reunion

351
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,070
with us instead?

352
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,480
Tomorrow, 5 p.m.

353
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,240
Deal?

354
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,480
Come alone.

355
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,800
If you don't,

356
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
you'll never

357
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,880
see her again.

358
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,280
Fine.

359
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,830
What about the identity

360
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,000
and assets you promised?

361
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,510
You're more capable and ruthless

362
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,440
than Mai Boyuan.

363
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,790
Why not come

364
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,760
and work for me?

365
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,920
Someone like me

366
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,070
doesn't belong beside you.

367
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,550
I just want what's fair

368
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,590
for years of sweat.

369
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,110
Time to live the life I want.

370
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,550
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

371
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,150
Okay.

372
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,240
If you ever

373
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,080
change your mind,

374
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,160
my door

375
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,310
is always open.

376
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,960
Wuyang's getting better.

377
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,830
There are more chances than out there.

378
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,960
I'm a lone wolf now.

379
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,000
There's nothing left to miss.

380
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,760
Mr. Gao,

381
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,400
though you've got the USB drive,

382
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,880
Mai Boyuan might still hold

383
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,110
other cards against you.

384
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,830
Better safe than sorry.

385
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,080
Tomorrow,

386
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,260
he'll be at the auction

387
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,450
held by the foreign investor.

388
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,830
