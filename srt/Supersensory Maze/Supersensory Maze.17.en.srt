00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,980
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,350
Hello?

4
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,190
It's a cloned plate.

5
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,400
Recently, it's got several tickets

6
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,730
near an unfinished building.

7
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,780
I'll send you the address.

8
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,120
Thanks, Shiqi.

9
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,250
I'll drive; you sleep.

10
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,810
It's fine; I'll drive.

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,990
You rest.

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,120
You kept this place intact

13
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
just to decrypt it?

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,150
I only wanted to test a theory.

15
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
Which is?

16
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,630
Your way of fighting back

17
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,840
was to hand your mother every ounce

18
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,400
of her own humiliation

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
and cruelty,

20
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,400
and then play the filial son.

21
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,150
Still lecturing me?

22
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,750
I'm in no position to lecture.

23
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,680
So, this is

24
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
a return to the crime scene?

25
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
No, I won't go.

26
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,040
No, no.

27
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
Don't.

28
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,680
Go! Leave!

29
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
Didn't I tell you

30
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,270
never to look at me like that?

31
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Never look at me like that!

32
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,750
Thanks, Yuan.

33
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Do you like it?

34
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,430
Of course, I do.

35
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Then it's worth it.

36
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,080
Mom,

37
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
why aren't you eating?

38
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,070
I want to watch you eat.

39
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
Mom,

40
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,750
do you wish I were dead

41
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
or

42
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
that I'd never existed at all?

43
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,830
Enjoy

44
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,600
this twisted

45
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,350
thrill.

46
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,870
You're profiling me.

47
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,560
You can't walk out of your shadow,

48
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,560
yet you can't go against your instinct

49
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,390
to crave love.

50
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,750
You can't get

51
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,560
the family you imagined,

52
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,950
so you kill.

53
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Mom,

54
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,670
I'll take care of myself.

55
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,750
Mr. Xu,

56
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,600
what kind of mother

57
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
would try to kill her child?

58
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,750
Yuan,

59
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,610
something's happened to my mom.

60
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,790
My existence

61
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,630
is proof that she was violated.

62
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
She shouldn't love me,

63
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,510
though we were supposed

64
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,960
to be the two people closest
in the world.

65
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,060
Don't look at me like that.

66
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,720
Don't...

67
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,510
Don't look at me like that!

68
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,230
Then how...

69
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,670
How am I supposed to look at you?

70
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,960
I don't have to look at you.

71
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,030
Everything you've done

72
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,840
is to attract my attention.

73
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
But can you see

74
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,000
who I really am?

75
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,510
For years,

76
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,480
I've replayed the case back then

77
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,750
in my head:

78
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,630
A punk

79
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,750
broke in to steal

80
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,390
and ran into Wu Min
coming home early.

81
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,790
In panic,

82
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,790
he smashed her skull

83
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,550
with an ashtray.

84
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,030
It makes sense logically.

85
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,200
The punk's confession

86
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,320
matches.

87
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,720
There will be no result

88
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,600
in a short time.

89
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,000
Let me take you out.

90
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,650
Even if we find the murderer,

91
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,390
I have no family left.

92
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
I want to know

93
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,480
why it had to be my mom.

94
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,040
Why?

95
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,870
She's gone.

96
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,120
All I have is you.

97
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,150
Find the truth.

98
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
I will.

99
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,670
The murderer knew you,

100
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,160
got your home address

101
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,670
through you,

102
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,200
and then broke in.

103
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,670
Thanks for telling me.

104
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,630
Get some rest.

105
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,840
Can you stay with me?

106
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,360
I can't sleep.

107
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
This case won't let me go.

108
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,550
I don't understand

109
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,390
why the burglar

110
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,480
had to kill Wu Min.

111
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,710
Also,

112
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,200
I sensed

113
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,320
a sudden relief

114
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
in you.

115
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,630
A strange hope

116
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,150
that I'd never seen before.

117
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,000
All the evidence

118
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
says the opposite.

119
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,790
I keep searching

120
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,750
for a reason,

121
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,080
putting myself

122
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,270
inside the burglar's head,

123
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,440
and returning to the scene
again and again.

124
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,790
It became an obsession.

125
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,750
Why would this punk

126
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,910
take so long to kill Wu Min

127
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,750
before he escaped?

128
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,390
There wasn't only one man.

129
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Who delivered

130
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,240
the fatal blow?

131
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Who?

132
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,550
I can't share your feelings.

133
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,790
You won't find

134
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,670
what you need in me.

135
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,440
Look carefully.

136
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
The you

137
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,270
Wu Min tortured.

138
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,120
You said

139
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
family shouldn't be like this.

140
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm not your family.

141
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,920
You murdered all your family.

142
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,390
Again.

143
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,200
See yourself clearly.

144
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Again.

145
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,150
Lu Ran.

146
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,960
Captain He, it's here.

147
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,800
Anyone here?

148
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,440
Anyone here?

149
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,280
We're police.

150
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,430
Anyone here?

151
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,390
Anyone here?

152
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,560
Captain He.

153
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,510
Call the bureau.

154
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,560
Liu Ming, where are you?

155
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,460
What's the situation?

156
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,330
Hello, Yin.

157
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,830
Do you see the location I sent?

158
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,390
I just saw it. I'm on my way.

159
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,740
I think Liu Wanyao is hiding

160
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,980
in this unfinished building.

161
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,160
I'm going in first to get a feel.

162
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,920
Then I'll call you.

163
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,830
Stay put.

164
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,240
Do not move alone.

165
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,240
Wait for us.

166
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,910
Hello?

167
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,570
- Yin, I...
- Come out.

168
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,680
Liu Ming? Liu Ming?

169
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,070
Your name is Liu Ming.

170
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,830
Two years on the force.

171
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,550
Both parents martyrs.

172
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,480
I ran into you

173
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,070
while driving Hu Bo's car

174
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,200
just to lure you

175
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,040
here today.

176
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,750
I have

177
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,720
a bomb here.

178
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,720
Do you want to test

179
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
if it's real or fake?

180
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,200
Liu Ming, don't move.

181
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,070
We're almost there.

182
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,220
Wait for us before you go in.

183
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,670
Hello?

184
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,910
Hello?

185
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,950
Liu Ming!

186
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,830
Get EOD and fire-rescue

187
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,530
to the unfinished building

188
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,670
on Guangzhi West Road asap!

189
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,540
Yes!

190
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,350
Captain He, Liu Ming found Liu Wanyao.

191
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm on my way.

192
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,110
Stay safe.

193
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,420
What about Xu Jingzhi?

194
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,680
Any idea who made the call?

195
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,360
I think it was Zhuang Mingcheng.

196
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,720
What's Zhuang Mingcheng after?

197
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,790
Watch yourself.

198
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,630
Stay in touch.

199
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,670
Okay.

200
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Wait for me.

201
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
I know

202
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,590
Hu Bo is a jerk.

203
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,340
He forced you into prostitution

204
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,590
and killed Wu Xinxin.

205
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,750
He deserved to die.

206
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,400
All the evidence

207
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,640
proves it.

208
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,480
For him,

209
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,880
it's not worth it.

210
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,110
Yes.

211
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,960
Hu Bo made your life hell.

212
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You only wanted him

213
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to feel your pain.

214
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,400
You studied medicine.

215
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,200
Your tolerance is higher.

216
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,400
This is not a sickness.

217
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
When I injected Hu Bo

218
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
with the flesh-eating bacteria,

219
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,590
he was still alive.

220
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,720
I watched

221
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,400
his heart

222
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,510
go thump, thump.

223
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,480
Do you still think I'm normal?

224
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
Psychologically,

225
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,000
revenge

226
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,550
is a healthy instinct.

227
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,590
You don't want

228
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
to kill yourself or me.

229
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,590
You still have a chance.

230
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,760
Don't come closer!

231
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,270
Listen to him. Go back.

232
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,960
I only wanted

233
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,260
to do a friend one last favor
before I die.

234
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,750
If I can't,

235
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,480
so be it.

236
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,240
No.

237
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,790
I'm taking you back.

238
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,550
Mai Boyuan confessed

239
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,390
live on-stream.

240
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,000
Even if you catch him,

241
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,100
he'll get the death penalty.

242
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,110
Why risk your life to save him?

243
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm saving you.

244
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,910
Save me?

245
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,750
I didn't want to help,

246
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,720
- but you...
- Think of Wu Xinxin.

247
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,640
You kill your enemy

248
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,480
and then yourself.

249
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,590
Is that the ending she wanted?

250
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,280
Xu Jingzhi!

251
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,000
Help!

252
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,080
Somebody!

253
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,590
Help!

254
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,400
Help!

255
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,440
Send it for testing.

256
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,440
Help!

257
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,510
Help!

258
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,030
Xu Jingzhi!

259
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,390
Then what?

260
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Then what?

261
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,750
What am I supposed to do?

262
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,400
Tell me!

263
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,400
If I

264
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,880
hadn't asked her

265
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,920
to steal that ledger,

266
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,830
she wouldn't have died.

267
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,110
It's my fault.

268
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,480
So, I'm taking

269
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,510
every one of them

270
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,240
one by one

271
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
to apologize to Xinxin.

272
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
You're wearing the gown

273
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,070
you two picked together

274
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,200
to apologize to her?

275
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,310
You chose it for her.

276
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,640
She loved white.

277
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,070
How could it not be beautiful?

278
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,510
How could it not be beautiful?

279
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,920
Even though she grew up

280
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,110
without parents,

281
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,200
she still became

282
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
gentle

283
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,790
and kind.

284
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,960
So many monsters deserve to die.

285
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,030
So many.

286
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,550
Why did it have to be her?

287
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,880
So, someone has to live

288
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,520
and remember her.

289
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,480
I'm not worthy.

290
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,110
She only has you.

291
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,350
I'm not worthy.

292
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,030
You can't walk out of your shadow,

293
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,510
yet you can't go against your instinct

294
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,480
to crave love.

295
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,400
You can't get

296
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,000
the family you imagined,

297
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,590
so you kill.

298
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,480
I'm not your family.

299
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,790
You murdered all your family.

300
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,920
Mai Boyuan is

301
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,680
in the container of the warehouse,

302
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,590
No. 83, Shibei Road.

303
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,190
Thank you

304
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,680
for believing me.

305
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,200
Liu Ming?

306
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,550
Liu Ming?

307
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,600
