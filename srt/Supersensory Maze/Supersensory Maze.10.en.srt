1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,640
Excuse me, can you do me a favor?

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm working part‑time here.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,800
My manager asked me

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,960
to invite people inside.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
- What do you want?
- You...

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,640
Come on, kiddo.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,640
Go home with Daddy.

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,600
Let go of me! Don't...

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,790
Don't...

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,320
Let me go!

11
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,260
=Supersensory Maze=

12
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,220
=Episode 10=

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,280
Thank you for the offer, Mr. Zhuang,

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,910
but I don't think

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,430
I can do this job.

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,150
People in the community said

17
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,080
you're short on money.

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,710
I don't really know how to do anything,

19
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,470
yet you're offering such high pay.

20
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,190
I know I'm the one you're supposed to

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,750
help through community correction,

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
but I can't take the job

23
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,190
and take your money like this.

24
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,150
Making money to find your girlfriend, huh?

25
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,180
(Fulfill the wish, the same person)

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Feifei?

27
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Feifei?

28
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
No!

29
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,550
Feifei.

30
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm Zelin.

31
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm Zelin.

32
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Feifei.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Feifei.

34
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,640
Feifei...

35
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,390
What did you do to her?

36
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,390
Why has she

37
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,560
ended up like this?

38
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,750
Ask you good friend from back home,

39
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,790
Zhang Chao.

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,480
Zhang Chao?

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,470
Feifei. Feifei.

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,840
Feifei!

43
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,390
Zhang Chao is not here.

44
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,430
It's me, Zelin.

45
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,560
Feifei, listen to me.

46
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,240
Zelin's here.

47
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Did you hear me?

48
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,560
Zelin's here.

49
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
After you went into rehab,

50
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,830
Zhang Chao tricked Feifei

51
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,950
into Jingmengwan Clubhouse.

52
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,750
There,

53
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,070
she was assaulted by different men,

54
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,630
and they filmed it

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,510
to blackmail those men

56
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,360
and Feifei.

57
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
As you can see,

58
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,190
Feifei couldn't handle

59
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,430
the trauma

60
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
and broke down.

61
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,800
Just stop running.

62
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
If you don't behave,

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
I'll take you down.

64
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,470
You...

65
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
That's enough.

66
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
We'll be busy tonight.

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
And,

68
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,430
don't wear so many layers.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Customers don't like it.

70
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,040
No way.

71
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,630
Get out of here!

72
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,910
Feifei,

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,950
I'm Zelin.

74
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm Zelin.

75
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm Zelin.

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Feifei.

77
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Open it.

78
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
You filmed all these, didn't you?

79
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,870
You still don't get it?

80
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Your enemy is not me.

81
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,240
This is a special blend I made for you.

82
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,800
Call me anytime if you need anything.

83
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,780
(You Only Live Once)

84
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,600
(See you next time.)

85
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,270
Captain He,

86
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,620
the call center got a report.

87
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,750
Someone saw Ding Chuan downstream

88
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,590
on the Taonan River.

89
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Notify everyone.

90
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,150
Move in and arrest him.

91
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,020
Use caution.

92
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,150
Wait for backup if needed.

93
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,990
Yes.

94
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,750
Team One, move out.

95
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,990
Notify tech support.

96
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,110
Yes.

97
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
Is it sweet?

98
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Yes.

99
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,960
It will never be bitter.

100
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
If I say that,

101
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
will they believe me?

102
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,390
Okay,

103
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
I'll do as you say.

104
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
Feifei,

105
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,240
you should follow what the doctors

106
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,320
and nurses tell you.

107
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,750
If you need anything,

108
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
just tell them.

109
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,990
- Thank you.
- No problem.

110
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,270
See you tomorrow, Zelin.

111
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,980
(Don't throw. Win a box of rice.)

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,060
(The Birth of Crime)

113
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,060
(The Birth of Crime)

114
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,540
(The Birth of Crime)

115
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,150
If someone commits a crime,

116
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,510
their family usually knows.

117
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,480
They just

118
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
choose to ignore it,

119
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
or look the other way.

120
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,790
You only read the chapter, right?

121
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
Yuan,

122
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,000
if your family commit a crime,

123
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,270
what would you do?

124
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,840
Cover it up,

125
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,000
punish

126
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
your kin for justice,

127
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,870
or pretend

128
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,910
you didn't know?

129
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,670
This isn't up for debate.

130
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,670
You said psychology

131
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,630
was nonsense, right?

132
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,700
(The Birth of Crime)

133
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,240
This book makes it feel like anyone,

134
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,910
no matter what kind of weirdo you are,

135
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,270
can be saved as long as they avoid those

136
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,630
twisted life experiences.

137
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,910
And even if they can't be saved,

138
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,320
some people are still

139
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,200
devoted to helping them.

140
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,350
Yuan,

141
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,350
you're right.

142
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,240
The world

143
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,550
is beautiful.

144
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,820
(No More Lies)

145
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,080
You used the color block numbers

146
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,000
around the stars

147
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,600
to make a ciphertext.

148
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,750
By shifting, you produced English letters

149
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,270
forming a Bacon's cipher.

150
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,270
But I knew you wouldn't

151
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,510
give such a simple puzzle.

152
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,720
You applied shifts to

153
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the digits labeled 0,1,2,4.

154
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,790
You then re-encrypted

155
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,670
that Bacon's cipher

156
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,030
with a Vigenère cipher.

157
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,200
I knew it.

158
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,920
This time

159
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,320
won't get the better of you.

160
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,720
You used my birthday as the key.

161
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,150
Were you worried I couldn't solve it?

162
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,390
Vigenère encryption

163
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,480
is meant to be solvable by specific people.

164
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,680
If it can't be cracked,

165
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,670
it has no meaning.

166
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,820
(Final ciphertext obtained)

167
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,000
(The key is your birthday.)

168
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,980
(Longitude, Latitude
Junhao Hotel, 6 PM)

169
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,040
Yuan,

170
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,070
aren't you worried I won't find it here?

171
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,200
This is a simple coordinate deciphering.

172
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,310
How could you possibly not find it?

173
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,720
Then the piano piece

174
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
you played for me today

175
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,240
is a world-class puzzle.

176
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,960
No hint?

177
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,750
Having the final password

178
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,960
makes the game meaningless.

179
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,680
Come on.

180
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,750
With seven basic notes

181
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,590
over five octaves

182
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,000
and 1,678 syllables

183
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,270
in the entire piece,

184
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,070
plus rhythm and stress variations,

185
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,750
the possibilities are in the quintillions.

186
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,880
That's like searching for
a needle in a haystack.

187
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
You're about to study chemistry.

188
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,630
How can you

189
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,310
not have this much patience?

190
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,070
I've been far

191
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,000
more patient with you than with chemistry.

192
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,040
See? It's all recorded.

193
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
I'll make use of it in college.

194
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,830
Maybe I'll crack it before

195
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,670
school even starts.

196
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,350
But if I play that piece

197
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,440
at random, with no

198
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,670
ciphertext behind it,

199
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,270
you'd never solve it.

200
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,630
You wouldn't do that.

201
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,830
Everything in this world

202
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,510
can be turned into ciphertext.

203
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,350
Add a premise, layer

204
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,270
encryption on encryption,

205
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,240
and you get

206
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
the same result.

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,070
This is just your

208
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,110
own obsession.

209
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Why do you cling

210
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,720
to a fixed key?

211
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,270
All these years solving puzzles with you

212
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,510
has been the most fun

213
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,920
I've ever had.

214
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,340
(Freezer-body Case. Liu Wanyao: Missing.
Best Friend: WU Xinxin.)

215
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,520
(Ding Chuan, crime of passion, Hu Bo, married,
domestic-violence, Wu Xinxin, Hu Bo's body)

216
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Captain He, coffee.

217
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
Thanks.

218
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,040
With no milk?

219
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,040
I forgot.

220
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
Captain He,

221
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,590
we found Ding Chuan's

222
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,830
online chats with Liu Wanyao

223
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,670
on his phone.

224
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,480
They hadn't been discovered earlier

225
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,880
because Liu Wanyao's phone number

226
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
was registered under

227
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,780
someone else's ID.

228
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,590
Liu Wanyao and Ding Chuan

229
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,400
started dating three months ago.

230
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,000
Later, Ding found that Liu was

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,070
involved in prostitution.

232
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,790
They had a huge fight.

233
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,270
Ding Chuan saw

234
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,920
chat logs between Hu Bo and Liu Wanyao

235
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
and believed she was

236
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,970
being coerced by Hu Bo.

237
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,000
Then he tortured and killed him.

238
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,590
He learned those torture methods

239
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,830
from Liu Wanyao.

240
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,640
In their chat records,

241
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,720
they mentioned a foreign,

242
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,680
niche forum

243
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,240
focused on dissection and torture,

244
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,750
through which Liu and Hu

245
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,830
had originally connected.

246
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,070
Liu Wanyao also told Ding Chuan

247
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,590
about this flesh-eating bacteria.

248
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,270
Later, Ding Chuan wanted to reconcile

249
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
on the condition that

250
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,160
Liu Wanyao quit her job,

251
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,510
but she refused,

252
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,590
unwilling to give up

253
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,430
the high-paying work.

254
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,030
So after killing Hu Bo,

255
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,070
Ding Chuan used

256
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,110
Hu Bo's phone

257
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,270
to text Liu Wanyao,

258
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,550
pretending to offer clients,

259
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,110
luring her to Hu Bo's house,

260
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
where he killed her,

261
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,590
dumped her body, and cleaned the scene.

262
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
He probably didn't realize

263
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
that another murder

264
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,110
had occurred in this room.

265
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,000
Afterwards, he hid

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,640
and lived for a while

267
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,920
using Hu Bo's identity and money.

268
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
If it weren't for Hu Bo's house

269
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,850
running out of electricity

270
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,880
and the freezer stopping,

271
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,240
we might never

272
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,310
have discovered the case.

273
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,160
Were the bank cards found in

274
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
Ding's house traced?

275
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,350
The Anti-fraud Unit investigated them.

276
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,790
These cards had been sold in bulk

277
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,030
by people trafficking

278
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,030
personal information.

279
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,590
First, these cards

280
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,550
weren't used for scams.

281
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,270
Second, each card was used only once,

282
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,270
and after each

283
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,480
legitimate transfer, the money

284
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,380
was withdrawn immediately.

285
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,270
This is why a dead man

286
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
could live for so long.

287
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,000
Zelin!

288
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
Zelin!

289
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,190
Hi, it's been a while.

290
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,830
Why did you call?

291
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,160
I have good news.

292
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Feifei contacted me

293
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,920
and wants to see me tonight.

294
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,950
Really?

295
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,240
Bro, tell me,

296
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,480
if I propose to her

297
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,880
when we meet tonight,

298
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,270
will she say yes?

299
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,830
I say no problem!

300
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,830
How about this? If she agrees,

301
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,270
you two can finally

302
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,720
live happily and steadily

303
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
from now on.

304
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,560
Let the past stay in the past.

305
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,720
No one brings it up,

306
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,560
okay?

307
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,920
Where are you meeting tonight?

308
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
We will come over too.

309
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,880
When you're done,

310
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,750
let's find a place

311
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,680
to have a real party.

312
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,830
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,670
Thanks a lot.

314
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,560
That's why I called you too.

315
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,830
Do you guys know

316
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,670
Jinmengwan Clubhouse?

317
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,750
She said it's in a small alley

318
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,590
next to the clubhouse.

319
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,920
Jin... Jinmengwan?

320
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,110
We'll check it out.

321
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,110
Thanks.

322
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,160
I want to get ready and buy Feifei

323
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,590
a gift this afternoon.

324
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,590
Alright, see you tonight.

325
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,590
See you tonight.

326
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,000
Xu,

327
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Ge Feifei has been found.

328
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,510
Tonight at nine,

329
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,350
in that alley

330
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,270
next to the clubhouse.

331
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,350
Okay.

332
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Okay.

333
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,860
(Coordinates Check)

334
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,020
(Jinmengwan Clubhouse)

335
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,780
(Jinmengwan Clubhouse)

336
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
What am I even paying you for?

337
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,030
You losers!

338
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,920
Hello, sir.

339
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,110
Do you have a reservation?

340
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,240
No.

341
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
This way, please.

342
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,440
Listen,

343
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
- This way, sir.
- this must not get out.

344
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,440
Qingqing, this customer has no reservation.

345
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,560
Hello, sir.

346
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,640
How many in your party?

347
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
Just one for now.

348
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,030
Okay, please wait a moment.

349
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,580
(Jingmengwan Clubhouse)

350
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,500
Sir,

351
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,070
we only have one large room left.

352
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Minimum spend is 18,000.

353
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,920
I'm not sure

354
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,160
how many friends are coming.

355
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,590
Maybe I'll wait to see

356
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,920
if a small room opens up.

357
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,110
That's fine.

358
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,520
Okay.

359
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,900
(Jinmengwan, 150 meters ahead)

360
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,240
Officer Xu.

361
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,040
Who are you?

362
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,390
Shi Zelin.

363
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
Shi Zelin? What are you doing here?

364
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,240
Are you after results

365
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,590
or the truth?

366
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,950
My house...

367
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,030
Captain He, someone called reporting

368
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,240
a planned revenge killing.

369
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,350
That's from a public phone

370
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,590
near Risheng Street.

(Are you after results or truth?)

374
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
You know him?

375
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,960
Most likely, he died from poisoning.

376
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,040
By the way,

377
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,110
we found this on him.

(Zhuang Mingcheng)

379
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,320
Hello?

380
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,350
Zhuang Mingcheng?

381
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Mr. Xu,

382
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,440
you finally called me.

383
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,160
I know you technical guys

384
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,240
are strict.

385
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
No autopsy,

386
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
no report,

387
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
and no conclusion.

388
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
But I really need

389
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,920
your experience now.

390
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,200
For now,

391
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,040
he's the murderer.

392
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,590
Based on ash and shoe prints

393
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,550
at the scene,

394
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,070
he was likely the first to be here

395
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,350
and waited for a while.

396
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,400
It was likely a premeditated murder.

397
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
When did you

398
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,550
know Shi Zelin?

399
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,720
When I volunteered at the community,

400
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,960
he was my mentee.

401
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,110
I met him twice during events.

402
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,510
Your restaurant

403
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,590
even hosts community events?

404
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,790
Are you meeting

405
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,030
with Shi Zelin now?

406
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,110
Great,

407
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,550
let's meet then.

408
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,030
A revenge killing usually leaves

409
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,880
a suicide note.

410
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,790
Why do you think

411
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,000
he killed for revenge

412
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,510
and not out of hatred for society?

413
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,720
The killer's goal is clear.

414
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,590
He was very calm.

415
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,880
The traces are obvious.

416
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,070
It seems he didn't try to

417
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,920
hide his crime at all.

418
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,680
Once he got what he wanted,

419
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,270
he'd probably tell someone why...

420
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,240
Enough, Sherlock Holmes.

421
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,350
Have Tang Shiqi check these two numbers,

422
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,590
see whose names they're registered under,

423
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,550
and check the recent call records.

424
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,110
Okay.

425
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,640
Shi Zelin is dead.

426
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,200
How could that be?

427
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,240
Then why are you

428
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,080
at his home,

429
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,110
Mr. Xu?

430
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,110
What are you doing here now?

431
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,270
Shi Zelin is someone I mentor.

432
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,480
He applied for a living allowance

433
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,550
through me,

434
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,200
and I'm responsible for delivering it.

435
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,590
That's why I'm here.

436
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,150
What about you?

437
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,310
How do you explain this?

438
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,880
I heard people say

439
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
Shi Zelin was short on money

440
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,310
and working multiple jobs,

441
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,160
so I invited him to my restaurant

442
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,550
to see if he wanted to be a waiter.

443
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,920
He said he'd think about it.

444
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,310
Then I gave him the number

445
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,320
you have now

446
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,030
so he could contact me

447
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,160
anytime once he decided.

448
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Did he contact you?

449
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,590
I never got a reply.

450
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,440
So I came tonight

451
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,750
to follow up.

452
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,030
Here's Shi Zelin's suicide note.

453
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,620
(Are you after results or truth?)

454
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,680
What are you after?

455
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,680
Mr. Xu,

456
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,750
I'm recording this.

457
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,310
If the police find

458
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,960
Shi Zelin's body,

459
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,920
there will be trouble.

460
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,110
But,

461
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,480
this can prove my innocence.

462
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,310
Compared to me,

463
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,480
a foreign volunteer,

464
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,510
it's even harder to explain

465
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,070
why a dismissed officer

466
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,000
would show up at the victim's home.

467
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,270
(Shi Zelin is dead.)

468
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,480
I hope our meeting

469
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,070
here tonight

470
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,070
(How could that be?)

471
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,110
stays between us.

472
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,960
(Then why are you)

473
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
(at his home,)

474
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,830
(Mr. Xu?)

475
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,880
(What are you doing here now?)

476
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,830
I heard that after

477
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,030
leaving rehab,

478
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,110
Shi Zelin never relapsed.

479
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,920
I ran into him a few days ago.

480
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,830
He was juggling several jobs a day,

481
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,920
working tirelessly while

482
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,400
searching for his girlfriend.

483
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,640
I didn't expect this happen to him.

484
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,590
As police officers,

485
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,200
we solve every case

486
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
we take on,

487
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
and it brings peace

488
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,480
to the victims' souls.

489
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,960
Captain He, check the work group.

490
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,630
We got a message.

491
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,620
(Victim Information)

492
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
Shi Zelin was from

493
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,590
the same hometown
as Zhang Chao and Han Kuo.

494
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
He was lured into drugs

495
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,480
by those two.

496
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,160
How did they get back in touch?

497
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,880
The priority now is confirming

498
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,350
the identity of the third victim.

499
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,550
Liu Ming, head back to the station

500
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,880
and wait for the tech report.

501
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,640
We'll go to Shi Zelin's home.

502
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

503
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,550
Mr. Xu,

504
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,790
no wonder you teach Criminal Psychology.

505
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,400
You've got nerves of steel.

506
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,270
You came back from the scene

507
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,920
without even changing your clothes?

508
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,640
What exactly is your purpose?

509
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,240
I just want to ask,

510
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,840
Mr. Xu,

511
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,110
how long do you plan

512
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,350
to stay here?

513
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,240
I'm thinking for your own good.

514
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,830
The police will

515
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,960
trace things here soon.

516
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,920
This is a gesture of my sincerity.

517
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,870
Of course,

518
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,920
if the police question me,

519
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,760
I'll tell them everything

520
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,400
about meeting you,

521
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,920
Mr. Xu, right here,

522
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,480
tonight.

523
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,510
But I also believe,

524
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
you will

525
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,590
keep our

526
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,190
shared secret.

527
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Thank you.

528
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,440
Be careful going upstairs later.

529
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,620
(Suicide Note)

530
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,320
I found his suicide note.

531
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,780
(Sorry, Captain He. You're a good person.
I may not be able to be one.)

532
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,420
(Are you after results or truth?)

533
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,940
(I'll make them pay! Die! Kill them!)

534
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,630
