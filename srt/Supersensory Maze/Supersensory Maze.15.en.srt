=Episode 15=

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,310
My name is Wu Haoxue.

4
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,600
Jiang Yue,

5
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,040
please cooperate

6
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,950
with our investigation.

7
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,400
Jiang Yue

8
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,760
is a name Hou Liangyuan picked.

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,200
It's to please him.

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,680
Haoxue

11
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,790
means white snow.

12
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,840
What a nice name.

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,710
He's never getting out, is he?

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Jiang Yongquan

15
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,680
is never getting out, is he?

16
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,640
Help us rescue

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,310
the women who were trafficked

18
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,430
and find more evidence

19
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,590
so the law can punish men like him.

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,030
Fengyang County.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
Jiujin County.

22
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
Yinghe Town.

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,430
Qimingba Village.

24
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
Pingding County.

25
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,340
Shayuan Village.

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,240
Jintang County.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Shuangliu County.

28
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,120
Wenjiangling.

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
Pi County.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Dayi Village.

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
How many women did you traffic

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,630
to these places?

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,280
Among all the suspects

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,630
of the "8·19" trafficking case,

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,150
only one is still at large.

36
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,680
If it weren't for me,

37
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,150
you'd still be

38
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,190
Jiang Yongquan.

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
All I know is

40
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
he's the boss of the crowd.

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
Skinny, about 1.7 m.

42
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,430
Everyone calls him Jiang.

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,120
A trafficker sold me

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,470
to Lu Youcheng's house

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
in Lujia Village.

46
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,750
He has a younger brother,

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
Lu Youliang.

48
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,280
Lu Youcheng's wife is Wu Min;

49
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,310
their son is Lu Ran.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
Stay calm.

51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,030
Calm down.

52
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,080
Lu Ran believes

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,960
Stay calm.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,470
his whole tragedy

55
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,750
started with Wu Min's abduction.

56
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,750
Everything he's done

57
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
is to make

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,910
every member

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,270
of that trafficking ring pay.

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm sure

61
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,040
you won't be the last one.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
With the evidence we now have,

63
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,160
we'll charge you with abduction,

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,750
kidnapping and extortion,

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,120
illegal detention,

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,830
intentional assault, and murder.

67
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,110
Who did I kill?

68
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,030
Show me the proof.

69
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,870
You killed your cousin Hou Liangyuan.

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,070
I'm right here.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,480
You ate yourself into this shape.

72
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,040
Every day, you were terrified

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,510
of turning back
into the wanted Jiang Yongquan.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,630
I've seen plenty of kids.

75
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
Timid,

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
clever,

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
and hot-headed.

78
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,510
They go from defiant to obedient.

79
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,240
No big difference.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I can tell

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,190
that you landed on your feet.

82
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,680
Back then,

83
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,750
I should've sold you

84
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
to a theft ring.

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,830
Time will not reverse.

86
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,360
Nothing suspicious here.

87
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,950
Do you have a camera at the gate?

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes.

89
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Freeze.

90
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,710
Don't move!

91
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,390
Stay down.

92
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,230
Cuff him.

93
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
We traced

94
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,630
every entry in the ledger.

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,150
Most of the money,

96
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,080
though routed through varied companies

97
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,840
and passed through several hands,

98
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,910
was finally invested in artworks.

99
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,910
Those pieces

100
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,910
were all exported

101
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,440
and auctioned overseas

102
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
via Liang Xinyue's firm.

103
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,160
Stranger still,

104
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,820
(Auctioned Artworks)
the latest shipment

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
originally scheduled for next week

106
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,030
was suddenly rushed out

107
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,550
last night.

108
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,750
Wang,

109
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,150
call customs right now

110
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,030
and block export channels
of those goods.

111
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,220
You check recent flights

112
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
and any out-of-province

113
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,550
or overseas travel

114
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,440
for Mai Boyuan, Zhao Xin,

115
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,550
Liang Xinyue,

116
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,000
and Zhuang Mingcheng.

117
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,840
We'll start at 5 million.

118
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,440
- 6 million.
- Sure.

119
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
6 million

120
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,630
from Bidder 51.

121
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,470
8 million.

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,910
8 million.

123
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,360
8 million

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,790
from Bidder 49.

125
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,670
10 million.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,960
10 million.

127
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,510
10 million

128
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,960
from Bidder 52.

129
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,150
Any higher, everyone?

130
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't have time

131
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
for your games.

132
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,750
Tell me where He Ya is now.

133
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,590
Going twice

134
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,870
at 10 million.

135
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,870
What's the rush?

136
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,900
We both suffered in Lujia Village.

137
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,750
- Sold!
- The head

138
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,990
of the trafficking ring is here.

139
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,030
All of them are rich and powerful.

140
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,630
- It's unfair, isn't it?
- Next one.

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,200
Should I thank you

142
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,000
for counting me as one of your kind?

143
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
I forgot to tell you:

144
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,720
He Ya's life is on a countdown.

145
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,060
(Starting bid)

146
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,900
Sold.

147
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
Lu Ran,

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
do you know why

149
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,600
I've listened to you this long?

150
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,750
I'd love to know what chip

151
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,080
could buy me.

152
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,240
You've always wanted to know

153
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,080
why you were born into that family.

154
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Fine.

155
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Next one, please.

156
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Hou Liangyuan is

157
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,080
Jiang Yongquan.

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Sold.

159
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,080
Mr. Xu,

160
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,080
you don't think

161
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,120
useless info like that

162
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,030
is trade-worthy, do you?

163
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,910
Your hatred

164
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,320
needs a clear target.

165
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,060
If you'd told me sooner,

166
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,480
maybe it'd be a chip.

167
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,960
But he's been arrested.

168
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,750
What would you do if I had told you?

169
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
Would you kill him?

170
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

171
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,270
You already suspected

172
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,270
I'd taken lives;

173
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,390
you just couldn't face it.

174
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,480
You chose blindness.

175
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,630
I chose you.

176
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,750
Time's up.

177
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,840
Here's the truth you chose.

178
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
Excuse me.

179
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,510
This is the result you wanted.

180
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,670
Which one do you want?

181
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,470
I want the result.

182
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,670
Where's your cool head?

183
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,910
Your reason?

184
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,910
Emotion solves nothing.

185
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,150
You taught me that.

186
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,550
I'm not the one who flips the board,

187
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,550
and I don't want it to be you.

188
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,360
I've never been

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,270
in the cage.

190
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,480
You chose your truth,

191
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,600
so you should pay for that.

192
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,030
I'll ask once more:

193
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,480
Where's He Ya?

194
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,270
Lane E-03, Logistics Warehouse,

195
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,150
No. 118 Guangli Road.

196
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,200
You have 57 minutes left.

197
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,510
Sir, please behave.

198
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,240
Sir, are you alright?

199
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,030
Why isn't Ms. Zhao here?

200
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,670
She asked me to pick you up first.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay.

202
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,750
Zhao Xin has had him

203
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,120
picked up.

204
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,000
Follow them.

205
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,440
I want to see his corpse.

206
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,320
Yes.

207
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,870
What are you doing?

208
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,120
15 minutes are left.

209
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,080
13...

210
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
10...

211
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,910
Anyone there?

212
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,600
Open the door!

213
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,120
Anyone there?

214
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,790
Anyone there?

215
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,680
Open the door!

216
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,110
He Ya!

217
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,830
He Ya!

218
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,720
You're too late.

219
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Yuan,

220
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,440
is this how you

221
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,270
experience pain?

222
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,100
(Wuyang Police Big-Data Platform)

223
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,150
Director Feng,

224
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,440
Xu Jingzhi is rushing

225
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,400
to No. 118 Guangli Road

226
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,240
to find Captain He.

227
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,880
He says Mai Boyuan may be in danger.

228
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,030
Surveillance shows

229
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,240
he left the auction

230
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,160
and never returned.

231
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,600
Cams nearby and along the road

232
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,400
are being checked.

233
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,270
His photo

234
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,550
has been sent to all departments.

235
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,960
Where's Yin Wei?

236
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,790
They're on their way.

237
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,880
About 90 minutes

238
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,270
to the warehouse.

239
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,790
Tell them to be fast.

240
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,160
Make sure He Ya is safe.

241
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,350
He Ya!

242
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,720
He Ya?

243
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,150
He Ya!

244
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,350
Soon,

245
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,400
you'll feel

246
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,640
what I felt.

247
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,920
You'll be free.

248
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
Yin Wei,

249
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,330
I'm at No. 118 Logistics Warehouse,

250
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,200
Guangli Road.

251
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,790
I've found Comrade He Ya

252
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,070
in Cold Warehouse III.

253
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,790
Yes.

254
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,720
Aren't you just me?

255
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,110
What are you afraid of?

256
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,270
Don't be afraid.

257
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,880
I'll take you home.

258
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Xu Jingzhi, wake up.

259
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,240
Xu Jingzhi!

260
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,390
Yuan,

261
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,310
don't you want to save me?

262
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,830
Why do you want to arrest me now?

263
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,790
When a person drowns

264
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,160
in their own state,

265
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
this is what happens.

266
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,510
Let go!

267
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm not sick!

268
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,590
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine!

269
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,430
Get him out.

270
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,920
I said I'm fine!

271
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,630
Yuan,

272
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,110
this isn't who you are.

273
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,920
I had a nightmare again.

274
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,550
I'm here; don't worry.

275
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,160
That's a dummy.

276
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,550
Are you looking for this?

277
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
Mr. Mai sent me...

278
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,030
I'll call him, then.

279
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,560
Zhao Xin,

280
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,750
you hid deep.

281
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,310
You had someone

282
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,550
hit me with a car, right?

283
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,830
It's just for this list?

284
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,160
If I hadn't been lucky...

285
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,240
Without me,

286
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,160
you'd have died 18 years ago.

287
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
What do you mean?

288
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,110
You know what I mean.

289
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,750
You can pretend

290
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,000
that night never happened.

291
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
But for me,

292
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
it's always been vivid in my mind.

293
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,790
In every sleepless night,

294
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,510
in every stranger's bed,

295
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,830
I'd think

296
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,000
of that day.

297
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,200
If I hadn't tried to save you,

298
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,830
I wouldn't have missed

299
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,960
the last bus,

300
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,920
nor would I have been abducted
by Hou Liangyuan

301
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,200
and sold to Mai Boyuan.

302
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,640
Nor would I have been standing here

303
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,480
to bear

304
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,290
your sneer and threat.

305
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,520
A glass.

306
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,110
I can't drink.

307
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,920
I really can't.

308
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,920
Be gentle.

309
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,280
Yes.

310
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,680
You're so lucky.

311
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,790
Good family.

312
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,560
Noble,

313
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,200
spotless,

314
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,830
and respectable.

315
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,480
What about me?

316
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm a whore,

317
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,350
a lowlife.

318
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Stop.

319
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,200
Why not wear the blue one?

320
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,440
The blue from last time

321
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,350
suited you.

322
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,610
It was custom-made for you.

323
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,030
You don't like this?

324
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,110
This style isn't you.

325
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,240
I mean this dress;

326
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,920
it's for little girls.

327
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,270
I still prefer your old look.

328
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,750
It's more seductive and charming.

329
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,240
No wonder you despise me;

330
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,160
I despise myself.

331
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,790
But

332
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,200
who turned me

333
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,310
into what I am today?

334
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,070
Stop.

335
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,310
You can't take it?

336
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,640
It's you!

337
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920
Stop!

338
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,440
What have you done all these years?

339
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,410
You've been helping Hou Liangyuan

340
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,920
and Mai Boyuan.

341
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,960
How could you face me?

342
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,790
How could you face the girls at school?

343
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,870
Who are you?

344
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,920
Who are you people?

345
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,160
What do you want?

346
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,030
Did someone hire you?

347
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,480
I'll pay double.

348
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,790
Name your price.

349
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,000
How can you not know me?

350
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,000
I've done

351
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
so much for you,

352
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
Mr. Mai.

353
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,070
You're Zhi Fei?

354
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,720
All these years,

355
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,270
I've never blamed you.

356
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,590
Funny.

357
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,480
If it happened again,

358
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,030
I'd still save you.

359
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,480
But my life

360
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
is already ruined.

361
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,200
Now, finally, there's a chance

362
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,680
to start over.

363
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,350
I don't want anything else.

364
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,200
I just want to live a normal life.

365
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,350
I beg you.

366
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,310
Please help me.

367
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Just this once, please.

368
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,790
Okay?

369
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,400
Sorry.

370
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,350
Thank you.

371
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,910
For our safety,

372
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,880
I couldn't contact you directly.

373
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,680
I hope there's no misunderstanding

374
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,550
between us.

375
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,980
I have substantial assets abroad

376
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,960
that need managing.

377
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,000
I want you

378
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,550
to work for me.

379
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,030
You can be direct.

380
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,550
Tell me how much you want.

381
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,960
There's no misunderstanding

382
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,920
or personal grudge.

383
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,550
Kidnapping you wasn't my idea.

384
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,960
I only promised to hand you over to her.

385
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
Why don't you two

386
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
talk it out?

387
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,950
Young lady,

388
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,810
I can give you
everything I promised him.

389
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,230
I can give you money.

390
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,230
Name your price.

391
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,590
I have many assets...

392
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,230
He's sincere.

393
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,880
You can talk to him.

394
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,000
I've heard enough

395
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,030
of men's lies.

396
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,400
I tried for you.

397
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,550
She won't budge.

398
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,440
It's up to you now.

399
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,840
What's the plan

400
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,030
for your mess?

401
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,030
No rush.

402
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,630
Let's watch the show first.

403
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,840
All of you have someone

404
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,630
you'd die for.

405
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,160
So?

406
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,630
What do you want?

407
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,070
Whether Xu Jingzhi

408
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,400
is truly cold

409
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,070
or just repressed,

410
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,070
what you're doing now...

411
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,960
He Ya is
the most important person to him.

412
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
So what?

413
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,400
I just want a result.

414
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,460
(Inpatient Department)

415
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440
Keep the wound dry.

416
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,840
No strenuous exercise.

417
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,840
- Got it.
- Thanks, doctor.

418
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
Thanks.

419
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,060
You still won't tell me

420
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,170
how you escaped

421
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,110
from the cold warehouse?

422
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,630
If I ever face

423
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,110
a life-or-death moment like that,

424
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,510
what do I do?

425
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
Educate me.

426
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,030
Qin has done that.

427
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
Who?

428
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,400
Remember

429
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
the auto-shop case?

430
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,320
I don't want Qin's lecture;

431
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,320
I want yours.

432
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,320
Oxygen bottles hold pressure

433
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,400
far higher than outside.

434
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,280
They explode

435
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,440
under strong impact

436
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,320
or heat.

437
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,030
Outside space,

438
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,800
oxygen content,

439
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,230
and pressure differential are the key.

440
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,230
Even if your math's perfect,

441
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,360
you can't predict

442
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
which way

443
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,710
the shrapnel flies.

444
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,920
What are you trying to say?

445
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,880
If it were you,

446
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,840
what would you do?

447
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,880
If it were me,

448
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,760
I'd trust you to accept

449
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
my decision.

450
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,190
But it's you now.

451
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,070
I don't know how to accept it.

452
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,360
Without you,

453
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,320
I'd be lost.

454
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,320
I love you, He Ya.

455
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,800
I love you.

456
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,400
Here they are.

457
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,510
Xiaoli! Xiaoli!

458
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,760
Xiaoli!

459
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,830
I just finished the paperwork
at the bureau.

460
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,800
From this moment,

461
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm back on the team.

462
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,360
