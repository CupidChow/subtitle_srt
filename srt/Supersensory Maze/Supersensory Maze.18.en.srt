=Episode 18=

3
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,760
Officer Xu says

4
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,320
this is Zhuang Mingcheng's skin tissue.

5
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,310
Test it now.

6
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,150
- Go!
- Yes.

7
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,000
You scared me.

8
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,280
Are you alright?

9
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,630
Why so sweaty?

10
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,750
The quilt's too thick.

11
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,630
I'll ask the doctor

12
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,830
to swap it for a lighter one.

13
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,150
It's too thick for June.

14
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,310
Have we gotten

15
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,150
the DNA report?

16
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
Not yet.

17
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,800
Stop worrying.

18
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,550
Hello?

19
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
Hello?

20
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Captain He,

21
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,640
Liu Ming...

22
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,310
Liu Ming's gone.

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
I know.

24
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,030
On my way.

25
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,190
When will you be back?

26
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,960
When the work's done.

27
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,750
Where's my dad?

28
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,240
He's gone to work.

29
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,750
He said I'll be better soon.

30
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
Is that true?

31
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
I already sent the application

32
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
to the angel.

33
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,800
If it's approved,

34
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,870
you can keep getting treatment.

35
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,070
Uncle Zhuang,

36
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,920
you don't know how desperate

37
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,800
my family is about my illness.

38
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,870
I want to help them, too.

39
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Uncle Zhuang,

40
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,390
when I grow up,

41
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,120
I'll repay you.

42
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,160
Don't worry.

43
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,830
Your father, Jiao Yu,

44
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,510
will repay me plenty.

45
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Thanks, Uncle.

46
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,120
I finally passed the exam!

47
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,800
Grandpa, Mom, and Dad

48
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
must be proud of me.

49
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,350
Mom,

50
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,390
I got into Wuyang Police Academy.

51
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,220
(Admission Letter)

52
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,040
I guess

53
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,750
I'm kind

54
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,870
of your colleague now.

55
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,270
Drop by in dreams sometimes

56
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,790
to teach me a few tricks.

57
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,080
Dreams?

58
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,160
That's absurd.

59
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,120
(Outstanding CPC Member)

60
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,160
I swear loyalty to the country,

61
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,120
the people,

62
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,190
and the law.

63
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,680
I will enforce justice impartially

64
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,940
and keep my integrity spotless.

65
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,870
Under the guidance

66
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,340
of the teacher I admire, Xu Jingzhi,

67
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,720
I graduated

68
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,750
and became an honorable

69
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,670
criminal-police officer like my parents.

70
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,840
When you hear about a homicide,

71
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
what do you feel?

72
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,510
All normal reactions.

73
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Those feelings

74
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
can demonize

75
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
or even deify

76
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,550
crimes we don't understand.

77
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,510
Criminal psychology

78
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,910
teaches us to break

79
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,630
through emotional bias.

80
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,150
Only by understanding
offenders objectively

81
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,480
can we identify

82
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,390
and catch them.

83
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,240
Today,

84
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,720
I'll report for duty.

85
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,030
I'm a rookie

86
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,150
who just graduated,

87
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,320
but I'll work hard

88
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,550
and learn from the veterans.

89
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,790
I'll punish evil

90
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,000
and uphold justice.

91
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,080
I won't disappoint my parents

92
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
and my grandpa.

93
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,910
I inherited my parents' career,

94
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,200
but not their badge numbers.

95
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,720
I want a path

96
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
of my own.

97
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,910
I'll protect

98
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,320
citizens' lives

99
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,220
and still find happiness

100
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,820
for myself.

101
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,200
I heard you were mugged yesterday.

102
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,630
These punks pick the wrong target.

103
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,470
Captain He,

104
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,270
rookies are being assigned...

105
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,110
Report!

106
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm Liu Ming, WPA Class 2005,

107
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,840
graduated in 2009,

108
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,910
Badge No. 016581,

109
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,510
reporting for duty!

110
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,110
Speak of the devil.

111
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Hi, I'm He Ya.

112
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,270
Stop saluting.

113
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,260
From now on, I lead you.

114
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,440
Call me anything.

115
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,390
Yes, Wei!

116
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
What are you laughing at?

117
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,790
It's Yin.

118
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,960
Yes, Yin!

119
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Your desk is here.

120
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,240
(Wuyang Police)

121
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,630
Grab some civvies.

122
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,820
We're leaving in a minute.

123
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,870
Yes.

124
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,510
I was lucky to be assigned

125
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,030
to CIU 1, where Mr. Xu once served.

126
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,800
I love

127
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,680
everyone here.

128
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,160
Thanks.

129
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,910
How did you spot the tire change

130
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,150
of Zhou Hui's car

131
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,550
on CCTV?

132
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,440
Still curious?

133
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
With only one tire

134
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,360
replaced,

135
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,270
the ride would be bumpy.

136
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
It crabbed

137
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,770
like it was climbing a slope.

138
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,960
If all four tires

139
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,870
match,

140
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,000
the ride would be smooth.

141
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,200
So, don't look at the tire.

142
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,550
You can't see it through the tire.

143
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,030
On my first day,

144
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,200
I bought a notebook

145
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
and a voice recorder.

146
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,440
I want to soak up knowledge

147
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,360
from my colleagues

148
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
like a sponge.

149
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,710
Let's go.

150
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,080
Your father used to say

151
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,270
that every cop will run

152
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,390
into a case they can't get past

153
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,200
sooner or later.

154
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,840
It shadows you for life

155
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,870
and can even wreck your life,

156
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,080
yet it also becomes

157
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,030
the reason you stay on the force.

158
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,670
I remember you said back then

159
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,390
that it was an obsession

160
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,480
born of trauma.

161
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,270
Turning the obsession

162
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,630
into a motive

163
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
was just evasion.

164
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
The real problem...

165
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
I said

166
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
that it would do nothing

167
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,670
for the real problem

168
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,870
and would only bring

169
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,320
even worse consequences.

170
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,550
Now, I realize

171
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
it isn't an obsession;

172
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,550
it's a conviction.

173
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,080
Even scarred and battered,

174
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,910
we're still pushed forward.

175
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:05,260
(Tomb of Martyr Liu Ming)

176
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
Officer,

177
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,360
Lu Youliang is an animal.

178
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,080
He abducted Wu Min and locked her up.

179
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,440
My child died.

180
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,720
My daughter died.

181
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,000
She's dead.

182
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,720
She's dead!

183
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,440
My girl was

184
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,000
just past 20.

185
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,360
Her life had barely started.

186
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
Those traffickers

187
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,270
and Lu Youliang destroyed it.

188
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,270
After she was rescued,

189
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,630
Wu Min kept hiding.

190
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
She was too scared to come home.

191
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,840
When we heard he'd been released,

192
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,320
we went to Lujia Village.

193
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,550
We pretended we wanted to rent a place.

194
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,240
Seeing two old people,

195
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,080
he agreed.

196
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,960
He had no idea who we were.

197
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,550
While we were handing him the rent,

198
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,510
we killed him.

199
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,630
It's this knife.

200
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,030
(Evidence bag)

201
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,390
My husband held him down.

202
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,120
I killed him.

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,270
It did it.

204
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,360
(Lu Youliang's body)
From the wounds,

205
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,790
the murderer's height

206
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,200
is at least 1.8 m.

207
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
This elderly couple

208
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,580
couldn't have inflicted

209
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
injuries like these.

210
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,150
The strength,

211
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,600
height, or force

212
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,630
doesn't match.

213
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,270
Yet they insist

214
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,910
they murdered Lu Youliang.

215
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,440
What was the motive?

216
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,720
We'd tracked a car accident

217
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,080
to Lu Youliang,

218
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,720
who bought their daughter,

219
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,770
Wu Min,

220
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,440
(Wu Min, Yunling)
the mother of Lu Ran.

221
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,770
(Abducted during freshman break)

222
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,650
(Sold to Lu Youliang)

223
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,600
(Died after a burglary)

224
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Lu Youliang was sentenced

225
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
for that reason.

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
So, Wu Min's parents

227
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,720
believe her death

228
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,020
was the aftermath of trafficking;

229
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,910
that's why they targeted Lu Youliang.

230
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,870
There's another loose thread.

231
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,550
From their arrival date

232
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,550
in Wuyang,

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,510
they didn't come after

234
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,600
Lu Youliang was released.

235
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,710
It was Lu Ran.

236
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,240
They were used.

237
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,910
Yesterday, Xu Jingzhi got

238
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,120
Zhuang Mingcheng's

239
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,270
DNA test result.

240
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
It matches

241
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,790
Lu Ran's exactly.

242
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,400
Lu Ran

243
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,350
was born in Lujia Village, Wuyang.

244
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
His father is Lu Youliang;

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,680
his mother is Wu Min.

246
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,270
Wu Min, a Yunling native,

247
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,070
got admitted into Wuyang University.

248
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,000
During freshman break,

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,110
she was abducted by Jiang Yongquan

250
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,200
and sold to Lu Youliang.

251
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,160
There, she gave birth to Lu Ran.

252
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,440
Throughout childhood, Lu Ran suffered

253
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,800
domestic violence

254
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,110
and watched his uncle

255
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,160
repeatedly rape his mother,

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,720
receiving no healthy

257
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
emotional feedback,

258
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,400
so his psyche grew twisted.

259
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,550
In Lu Ran's final year of high school,

260
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,480
Wu Min died

261
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,160
in a burglary.

262
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,550
Later, Lu Ran went abroad

263
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,070
to study chemistry.

264
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,310
Five years ago,

265
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,530
Lu Ran died overseas.

266
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,640
Lu Youliang was still in prison.

267
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,030
He didn't even know

268
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,120
Lu Ran had left the country.

269
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,720
He came to me probably for money

270
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,110
and his son,

271
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,790
never imagining that Lu Ran,
who'd been tailing me,

272
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,880
would spot him.

273
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,510
Actually,

274
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,350
the real Zhuang Mingcheng

275
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,990
inherited his parents' company

276
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,790
after their death.

277
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a foreign gene-database

278
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
storage firm.

279
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,110
That let Zhuang Mingcheng swap

280
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,000
his data with Lu Ran's.

281
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,440
Lu Ran exploited

282
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,720
Zhuang Mingcheng's depression

283
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,880
and used a lab explosion

284
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,310
to drive him to suicide.

285
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,030
Later,

286
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,880
(Lu Youliang)
after plastic surgery,

287
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,550
Lu Ran took Zhuang's identity

288
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,720
and returned to Wuyang.

289
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,310
I once took a call

290
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,350
from Lu Youliang.

291
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,790
Thinking back, I believe

292
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,960
Lu Ran must've left it for me.

293
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,720
Lu Ran's hatred for Lu Youliang

294
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,880
is beyond ordinary imagination.

295
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,480
Dad,

296
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
it's me.

297
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm Lu Ran.

298
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,200
You've got it wrong.

299
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,550
Jiang Yongquan abducted Xu Jingzhi.

300
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,790
If you want revenge,

301
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,790
go after Jiang Yongquan.

302
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
What about my mother?

303
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,310
You bought her and raped her.

304
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,480
You deserve to die.

305
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,400
While committing the murder,

306
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,690
he also steered my attention

307
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,980
toward Lu Youliang,

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,160
taking it for granted that I

309
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,270
also hated Lu Youliang.

310
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
Hello?

311
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,790
Is this Lu Youliang?

312
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,000
Hello?

313
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
Hello?

314
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,310
Every victim in this chain of cases

315
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,440
is connected
to the old trafficking case.

316
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,310
He made me take off my uniform

317
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,310
because he wanted me to stand beside him

318
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,900
and help him

319
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,310
claim lives

320
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,500
from the trafficking ring.

321
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,550
So far, we still don't know

322
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,920
whether Lu Ran will use

323
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
Zhuang Mingcheng's identity
to flee abroad

324
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,120
after finishing his revenge.

325
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,480
Lu Ran's emotional reactions

326
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,310
are the reverse

327
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,350
of those of an ordinary person.

328
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,310
He's good at exploiting

329
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,560
other people's needs

330
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,160
and wishes...

331
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,520
not wishes,

332
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,550
but desires,

333
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,830
and manipulating them

334
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,180
into committing crimes.

335
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,920
Xu Jingzhi

336
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,810
had reported

337
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,780
Lu Ran's situation to me.

338
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,310
At that time, we had no direct proof.

339
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, we can basically confirm

340
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,900
Lu Ran is the mastermind

341
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,720
behind this series

342
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
of cases.

343
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,640
The priority

344
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,880
is to locate Lu Ran's whereabouts.

345
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,030
Hello?

347
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,310
Traffic control spotted

348
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,000
a suspicious van

349
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
that stopped at Wuxi Chemical Plant

350
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
and then drove off.

351
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,930
Is it Zhuang Mingcheng?

352
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,030
Yes. It's confirmed on CCTV.

353
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,240
(He Ya)
A unit is in pursuit.

354
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,580
Zhuang ducked into a logistics center

355
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,650
(Zhuang Mingcheng)
and escaped behind bigger vans.

356
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,920
But we found he bought

357
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,790
an international flight departing today,

358
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,550
three hours from now.

359
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,070
Zhuang should be

360
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,400
on his way to the airport.

361
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
Issue an emergency warrant.

362
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,920
Seal every exit from the city.

363
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,030
Don't let
a single suspicious vehicle through.

364
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,870
Move!

365
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,200
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

366
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,720
- Out!
- Don't move!

367
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
What are you doing?

368
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,940
Where's Zhuang Mingcheng?

369
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,880
Why drive his car?

370
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,830
I'm a designated driver.

371
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,640
I was hired
to deliver stuff to the airport.

372
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,350
Wrong guy.

373
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,720
Not him.

374
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,030
Another decoy.

375
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,190
Xu Jingzhi!

376
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,590
Team 2,

377
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,530
follow Captain He's car.

378
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,020
(Police)

379
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,830
You gave him all these?

380
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,480
Yes.

381
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,960
I don't believe he's dead.

382
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,480
Lu Ran's first fake death

383
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,310
was to swap identities.

384
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,920
Now, he committed suicide

385
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,720
in front of so many witnesses.

386
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,550
There must be a bigger plan.

387
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,030
Lu Ran had a tragic childhood.

388
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Perhaps, to him,

389
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,720
his existence

390
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,510
was the burden

391
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,070
that made Wu Min

392
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,350
feel she couldn't breathe.

393
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,680
I thought

394
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,830
Lu Ran,

395
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,110
like the child I once was,

396
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,680
could find a way out for his heart.

397
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,240
But I forgot

398
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,880
I had He Ya

399
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,270
and He Ya's father.

400
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
I had role models to learn from.

401
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,680
Little Lu Ran

402
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,480
only had me,

403
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,590
a brother still groping for the path.

404
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,520
Yuan,

405
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,480
sometimes, one wrong step

406
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,350
is the point of no return.

407
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,240
(The child I was)

408
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,550
(was once just as ignorant.)

409
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,510
(Xu Jingzhi's arrival)

410
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,550
(showed me)

411
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,070
(that the family I lived in)

412
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,110
(was deformed.)

413
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,270
(He awakened)

414
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,880
(my longing for normalcy.)

415
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,470
(Little did I know)

416
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,710
(The Birth of Crime; Passport)

417
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,470
(this would become my obsession.)

418
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,940
(The perfect crime)

419
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,900
(The perfect crime)

420
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,500
(The Birth of Crime)

421
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,700
(The perfect crime)

422
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,440
(Even less did I expect)

423
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,550
(Wu Min's death)

424
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,720
(to become Xu Jingzhi's obsession.)

425
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,240
(His relentless pursuit of the case)

426
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,480
(terrified me.)

427
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,110
(The only thing I could do)

428
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,920
(was run.)

429
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,720
(Leaving was forced upon me.)

430
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,680
(I thought Wu Min's death)

431
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,640
(might give me a chance)

432
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,680
(to have a normal family.)

433
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,550
(I never imagined that I myself)

434
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,000
(would become)

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,170
(that family's true obstacle.)

436
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,350
(Since the one relative I had
cast me aside,)

437
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,830
(then everyone else)

438
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,310
(had better prepare to welcome me.)
