1
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,920
I have reviewed the promotional plan

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,760
you made for me.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,120
It's quite good.

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,130
I'd like to ask you
to take charge of it.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,600
Really?

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,350
That's great; it's my honor.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,070
I will surely complete it.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,070
I heard you are abroad.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,350
Can you make it back on time

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,990
to finalize the plan with the publisher?

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,840
Don't worry.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,680
Leave it to me.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,480
(Hello, Mr. Xu.)

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,550
(I am Zhi Fei, an editor.)

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,400
(I will be in charge)

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,180
(of the publishing)

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,640
(of Examples of Criminal Psychology.)

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,660
(Looking forward to it.)

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,700
=Supersensory Maze=

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,740
=Episode 6=

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,710
This is Lu Ran, right?

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
You know each other?

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
My schoolmate.

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
A college schoolmate?

25
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,710
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

26
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,630
I still remember

27
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,000
the laboratory explosion incident.

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
We used to be very good friends.

29
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,590
I often miss him.

30
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,750
Me, too.

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,870
I didn't expect

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,870
the brother Lu Ran often mentioned

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,430
to be you.

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,000
I didn't expect it either

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
that you were schoolmates.

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,780
The Mingcheng Scholarship
at Kazen University

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,480
was established by my parents

38
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,730
in my name.

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
And Lu Ran

40
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,630
is the most outstanding

41
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,470
among them.

42
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,960
We met there.

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
Another round?

44
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,710
One more round.

45
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,130
We're not in a hurry; take it slow.

46
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,800
Sometimes,

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,750
taking it slow won't get results.

48
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,630
You must attack,

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,520
even if it costs something.

50
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,910
You're still young.

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
My father often told me

52
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,150
that if you're not sure you can win,

53
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,270
don't do it.

54
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,670
If you do it,

55
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,630
you must win.

56
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,310
The original family will have

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,560
some influence on the child.

58
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you empathizing with me?

59
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,000
I am not a psychiatrist.

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,270
Then you are profiling me.

61
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,270
Do I look like someone who likes

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,830
to bring work into their personal life?

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,760
Do I?

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,630
I just feel

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,310
that you seem different

66
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,510
from the brother

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,460
that Lu Ran often mentioned.

68
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,240
How did Lu Ran see me?

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
He said you were a good brother.

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,720
Maybe it's hard in your country,

71
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,200
but here,

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,070
everyone's biological information

73
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,240
is stored on my company's servers.

74
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,820
If I just swapped

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,220
the information of two people,

76
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,750
no one would notice at all.

77
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,160
The scholarships at this school

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,040
are all named after you.

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,350
Do you think

80
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,390
we can keep it from others?

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,240
What about plastic surgery?

82
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,670
But

83
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,510
only one Zhuang Mingcheng

84
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,120
can live in this world.

85
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,390
Thank you for reminding me,

86
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,910
Lu Ran.

87
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,630
He said that all his achievements

88
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,190
were thanks to you.

89
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,510
So, I'm curious.

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,430
Lu Ran said

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,870
you never visited him.

92
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,720
I did owe Lu Ran

93
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
something.

94
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,760
If I could do it all over again,

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,750
I'd want to make it up to him.

96
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,780
(Liu Wanyao)

97
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,780
(Citizen Personal Fingerprint, Lu Ran)

98
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,390
Mr. Xu, you may collect Lu Ran's ashes

99
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,680
within three working days.

100
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
This contains the address
and phone number

101
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
of the funeral home.

102
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,720
What about the autopsy report?

103
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,870
You need to ask the police.

104
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,830
The neighbor complained
about Room 1103

105
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,200
(He Ya)
for having too many flies.

106
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,440
The owner couldn't be reached,

107
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,550
so we were called.

108
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,030
When we came over, we found

109
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,150
body parts hidden in the freezer
in the living room.

110
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,390
They've been taken back.

111
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,720
What did the M. E. say?

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,330
For now, they can only determine

113
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,380
that it's an adult female.

114
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,030
Any other valuable information?

115
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
There's one more strange thing.

116
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,780
Look for yourself when you get there.

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Bye.

118
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,750
Anyone here?

119
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,470
I'm here.

120
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,420
The homeowner is called Hu Bo.

121
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
About 3 months ago,

122
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,890
he was assigned to the overseas branch.

123
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
He brought his wife, Wu Xinxin, along.

124
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,960
The property management said so.

125
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,940
It hasn't been verified.

126
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,650
If it weren't for the power outage,

127
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,390
this corpse

128
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,040
might not have been discovered.

129
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,320
Xu Jingzhi.

130
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,130
This refrigerator was placed here.

131
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,600
Don't you find it strange?

132
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,220
This isn't a refrigerator.

133
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,110
It's a freezer.

134
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,150
It should be placed in the kitchen.

135
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,870
Why would it be placed here?

136
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,110
Xu Jingzhi?

137
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
The smell is really strong.

138
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
What do you think of the crime scene?

139
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,750
There are almost no traces

140
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,950
of living here.

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Even if the killer cleaned up,

142
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,440
it couldn't be as spotless as it is now.

143
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,770
It'd surely have gathered dust.

144
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,630
Also,

145
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,840
the placement of this freezer

146
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,680
is suspicious.

147
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,320
Quite a few suspicious points.

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
But before the time of death

149
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
and the number of victims are confirmed,

150
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,960
it's hard to judge.

151
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,130
Are you thoroughly recovered?

152
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,150
I'll go back and rest.

153
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,780
(Rice cake)

154
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,120
Cooking is

155
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,550
a special form of chemistry.

156
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,080
So, in fact, this is still

157
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,030
his profession.

158
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,910
Maybe it's because he

159
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,550
no longer takes over
the family business,

160
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,360
he's been more outgoing and cheerful.

161
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,750
Mr. Xu is so interested in me?

162
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,580
You could just ask me directly.

163
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,960
There haven't been

164
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
any murder cases lately?

165
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,240
Isn't it good to be safe and sound?

166
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
He's a regular here.

167
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,080
Officer Xu.

168
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,630
We already know each other.

169
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,390
Alright then.

170
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,790
What's this?

171
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,540
Let me treat you to rice cakes.

172
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,550
Do you like rice cakes?

173
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,870
Yes.

174
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,660
I started to eat it since childhood.

175
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,580
The taste from childhood
is unforgettable.

176
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,630
Thank you.

177
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
Are these flowers prepared

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
for your mother?

179
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
Yes, every year at this time.

180
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,670
I remember your parents died
in a plane crash

181
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,750
on Christmas.

182
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
Mr. Xu,

183
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,580
you checked very thoroughly.

184
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,390
But in our family,

185
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,270
we hold memorials on birthdays.

186
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,480
My mother's birthday is coming.

187
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,960
Mr. Xu,

188
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,290
you can look into it again.

189
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,910
I feel like the way
you're looking at me now

190
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,360
is like you're looking at Lu Ran.

191
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,000
You look so much like Lu Ran.

192
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,210
Seeing you makes me wish even more
that Lu Ran were alive.

193
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,910
Alive above the legal bottom line.

194
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
You, too.

195
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,110
Yuan.

196
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,320
My mother is dead.

197
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,270
Don't look at me like that again.

198
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
Don't look at me like that again!

199
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
You have the same eyes

200
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,200
as a rapist.

201
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
There will be no result

202
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,590
in a short time.

203
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,920
Let me take you out.

204
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,310
I will surely find the murderer.

205
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,590
I want to know

206
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,030
why it had to be my mom.

207
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,480
Why?

208
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
I don't want a result.

209
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,720
I want the truth.

210
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,000
Why don't you go in?

211
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,110
I just saw Editor Song

212
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,280
go upstairs.

213
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,720
So many writers in this building.

214
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,200
Today, you found
a fresh blood fingerprint

215
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,030
under the end table.

216
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,610
The dismembered body
was hidden in the freezer.

217
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,550
The freezer was then placed

218
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,110
in the living room.

219
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,350
The scene was cleaned spotlessly.

220
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,440
Clearly,

221
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,790
this scene was reserved for us.

222
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,470
You haven't changed that bad habit.

223
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
We welcome ideas

224
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,030
that help solve the case.

225
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,160
But you can't act on your own.

226
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,390
Can you do that?

227
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,110
I'll try my best.

228
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,960
That's not enough.

229
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,310
You must do it.

230
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,580
Why did you become a police officer?

231
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,920
To explore myself and the truth.

232
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,550
Looks like you should

233
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,790
take a good look at yourself.

234
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,750
What do you want?

235
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,590
You.

236
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,060
(Beautiful Writer Chen Danling)

237
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,820
(Please contact me, Lu Youliang)

238
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,060
(Lu Youliang)

239
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,240
I thought you wouldn't contact me again

240
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,210
after the police came
to see me last time.

241
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,860
(500,000 Yuan)

242
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,070
Quite generous.

243
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,030
Help me look into Xu Yi.

244
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,640
Who has he been meeting with lately?

245
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,580
What has he been doing?

246
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,440
My scope of business

247
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,400
does not include

248
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,480
marital infidelity.

249
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,030
It has nothing to do with that.

250
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
His club

251
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,830
is not a business he built alone.

252
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,320
When do you need it?

253
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,480
The sooner, the better.

254
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,010
That public training school

255
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,360
under your name.

256
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
If you have time,

257
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,440
it's best to go and take a look.

258
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
What do you mean?

259
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,340
The supply source of the club.

260
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,390
Mr. Xu,

261
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,750
I need to talk to you.

262
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,000
Is it convenient?

263
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,390
Of course.

264
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,920
Please sit anywhere you like.

265
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Sure.

266
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,070
Just right.

267
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,200
I have something to give you.

268
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,160
Do these designers nowadays

269
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,750
even have any taste?

270
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,940
It's the same decoration style

271
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,300
as your home.

272
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,020
Last time I went to your place,

273
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,980
it startled me.

274
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,350
This is for you.

275
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,720
I asked a friend.

276
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,110
During the year-end evaluation,

277
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,310
it can earn extra points.

278
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,640
Thank you for saving my life.

279
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,240
I can't accept it.

280
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,520
How about this?

281
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,960
If it's convenient for you,

282
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
deliver it to my workplace.

283
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,150
Okay.

284
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,110
Do you like collecting

285
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,480
different little toys?

286
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
All made in China?

287
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,070
It's just a hobby.

288
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,960
I bought them all in Chinatown.

289
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,910
This one.

290
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,400
My favorite when I was a child.

291
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,590
I even skipped class

292
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,270
just to buy it.

293
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,110
But after buying it,

294
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,660
my parents wanted to take it away.

295
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,880
Yet I was good at hiding it.

296
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,940
(Police)

297
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,340
(Controlled Personnel, Lu Youliang)

298
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,420
(Sentence completed,
released on April 12, 2011)

299
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,380
(Jiang Yongquan)

300
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,780
(Culprit of the "8·19" trafficking case,
currently at large)

301
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,750
I am not capable.

302
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,540
But if your father hands
the business over to me,

303
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,640
would I go work

304
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
under Mai Boyuan?

305
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,310
Don't mention Mai Boyuan to me.

306
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,650
Your club can make money

307
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,850
through a legitimate business.

308
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,170
I can also give you money.

309
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,160
Why make the business dirty?

310
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,070
If you hadn't lost

311
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,030
that camera,

312
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,250
would I be this passive now?

313
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,850
What does it have to do
with the camera?

314
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,030
What did you shoot?

315
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,250
What could I have shot?

316
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,960
What could I possibly have shot?

317
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,550
Inside is our lifeline.

318
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,590
That thief

319
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,880
only stole a worthless camera.

320
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,950
Here's the thing.

321
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,550
I'm going to write a new book next.

322
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,750
It's about the impact

323
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,200
of genetic inheritance

324
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,690
on psychological growth.

325
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,000
Would you be willing to continue

326
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,180
to take charge of my new book?

327
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,870
Zhi Fei?

328
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,160
Looking forward to our collaboration.

329
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
Actually,

330
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
my designer

331
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,950
was also amateurish and tasteless.

332
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,830
My home was decorated by my ex-wife.

333
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,480
I didn't put any thought into it at all.

334
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,790
You actually copied

335
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,310
my ex-wife's idea.

336
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,350
Your field of study is...

337
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,200
DNA decoding and sequencing.

338
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,790
After my parents passed away,

339
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,830
I took over

340
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,270
the family business.

341
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,880
But as you can tell,

342
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,750
with my personality,

343
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm not suited for those social niceties

344
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,070
in the company.

345
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
Alright.

346
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm going to rest.

347
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,640
Mr. Xu, take care.

348
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,910
Good night.

349
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,590
I'll take the trash out for you.

350
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
Thank you.

351
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,220
(Jing)

352
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Yi.

353
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,070
- Where is Mr. Hou?
- Mr. Hou?

354
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,030
He just left.

355
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,000
Left?

356
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
Hello,

357
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,240
Hou.

358
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,030
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

359
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,160
I just came over.

360
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You look too busy.

361
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,680
How's the ledger?

362
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
How's the ledger?

363
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,350
I've looked

364
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,440
everywhere I should.

365
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,350
Still no luck.

366
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
But Hu Bo's matter

367
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,580
needs to be resolved asap.

368
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,480
If someone else gets the ledger,

369
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,830
neither of us

370
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,670
will end up well.

371
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,650
There are also negatives.

372
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,830
How did you know about this?

373
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,550
That person
investigated faster than you.

374
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,070
Any new findings on the carpet?

375
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Blood sedimentation.

376
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,640
After the tech dpt. cut open the carpet,

377
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,480
they discovered it.

378
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,880
It's been taken back for testing.

379
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,350
Also, the identity of the victim

380
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,200
was almost confirmed.

381
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Her face is complete.

382
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
It should be Wu Xinxin.

383
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,480
The body has been decomposed,

384
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,030
but there are no missing parts.

385
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
Except for cutting marks,

386
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
there are very violent injuries

387
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,720
caused before death

388
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,000
in the chest, head, and neck.

389
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,350
Maybe the cause of death is one of them.

390
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
There's detergent residue.

391
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,200
It shouldn't have been long.

392
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,670
Liu Ming,

393
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,380
check the surveillance
on the 11th floor.

394
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,460
See who has entered this room
within the past week.

395
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,320
Okay.

396
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
Captain He,

397
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,670
we found this.

398
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,560
Flashlight.

399
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,350
There is a second victim.

400
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,480
The victim, Wu Xinxin,

401
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,960
(Hu Bo, Wu Xinxin)
is Hu Bo's wife.

402
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,580
5 years of marriage. A housewife.

403
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,050
Her social connections were simple.

404
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,160
As for another victim,

405
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,070
Qin, please explain.

406
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,240
(Crime scene photo)
As for this blood fingerprint,

407
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,510
the bloodstains and fingerprints

408
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,630
do not belong to the victim.

409
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,560
This blood fingerprint

410
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,850
was formed less than a week ago.

411
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,570
The owner of the blood is a female.

412
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,920
The large amount of blood

413
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,030
under the carpet

414
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,870
also belongs to her.

415
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,740
(Crime scene photo)
We're checking who she is.

416
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,820
Bloodstains on the carpet

417
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,270
were cleaned with a floor scrubber.

418
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,480
Based on what we were able

419
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,350
to extract,

420
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,550
the amount of blood loss
was already very large.

421
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,730
We still need further analysis

422
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,020
before we can draw a conclusion.

423
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,030
The current prime suspect

424
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,270
is the missing Hu Bo.

425
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,640
He lied to the property management

426
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,310
that he was assigned overseas

427
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,960
and had to take his wife with him.

428
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,030
So, he most likely premeditated

429
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,000
the murder.

430
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,200
Two women and one man.

431
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,400
A love triangle, I guess.

432
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,960
These three people must be connected.

433
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,920
But not necessarily

434
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,550
in the way we imagine.

435
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
Alright.

436
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,150
Let's wait for the info
on the second victim.

437
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
We'll follow their relationship.

438
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,550
The fresh blood at the scene

439
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,830
belongs to Liu Wanyao.

440
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,960
She was previously

441
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,430
a victim of domestic abuse.

442
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,680
Domestic abuse?

443
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,200
It was ten years ago.

444
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,740
The convicted person was

445
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,340
her mother, Zhao Chunzhi.

446
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,790
Long-term abuse of children.

447
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
Domestic violence.

448
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,320
She also has a history of drug use.

449
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,790
It relapsed after release.

450
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,480
She committed robbery with her boyfriend

451
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,420
and went back to prison.

452
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,180
(Case Registration Form)

453
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,780
(Case Acceptance Receipt)
The informant

454
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,160
is Wu Xinxin's husband.

455
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,780
(Hu Bo)

456
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,240
Ten years ago,

457
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,270
Wu Xinxin and Hu Bo

458
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,350
weren't married yet, right?

459
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,270
What was their relationship?

460
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,590
If it hadn't been

461
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,830
for registering her household,

462
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,440
I wouldn't have married

463
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,480
a useless man.

464
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,550
I worked so hard

465
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,760
to raise her,

466
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,950
and what did she do?

467
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,320
She sent me to prison.

468
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,960
Whatever happened to her,

469
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,330
or what crime she committed,

470
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,800
it has nothing to do with me.

471
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,950
Across the street.

472
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Do you know Hu Bo?

473
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,440
Is that her man?

474
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,710
Has Liu Wanyao contacted you recently?

475
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,760
Contact me?

476
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
Why?

477
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,320
Does Liu Wanyao have

478
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,160
any close friends?

479
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,910
We met once.

480
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,200
This is Hu Bo's last known whereabouts

481
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
we can trace.

482
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,190
Have you ever seen this man?

483
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,000
I remember now.

484
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,480
He's quite strange.

485
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
He paid half a month's rent

486
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,540
but left after staying a few days.

487
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,810
Are you sure it was him?

488
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,230
Do you know where he went?

489
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,320
When he left, he asked

490
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,180
how to get to the minibus
to Dingquan County.

491
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,200
Dingquan?

492
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,690
I have the timetable here.

493
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,320
Here.

495

496
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,030
Liu Wanyao is quite miserable.

497
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,190
Lu Ran and Liu Wanyao's

498
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,760
original families are quite similar.

499
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,550
I feel like

500
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,000
you've been thinking about the past.

501
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,110
Lately, I've been thinking

502
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,680
about the things between us in the past.

503
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,980
Then I must have really failed

504
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,150
if thinking of me

505
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,840
makes you look deeply resentful.

506
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
Really?

507
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,550
What a fake smile.

508
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,670
Do you still remember the one

509
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,920
called Zhuang Mingcheng?

510
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,880
The rich man

511
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,630
who almost lost his life from dating?

512
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,150
Do you think he looks like Lu Ran?

513
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,360
I think you should

514
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,480
go see a psychologist.

What to do next?

After Zhao Xueli died,

529
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,000
we can force Jiang Yongquan out.

530
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,900

and Zhao Xueli,
who managed the ledger, died,

532

Jiang Yongquan and his boss behind him

533
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,630
will suspect each other,

534
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,140
thinking they've obtained the ledger,

535
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,000

they'll jump out to protect themselves.
