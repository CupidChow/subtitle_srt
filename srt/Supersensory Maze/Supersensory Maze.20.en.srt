=Episode 20=

3
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,040
The stuff is off the clock.

4
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,590
Why are you still inside?

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,480
The game isn't over yet.

6
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,000
Whoever you care about

7
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
ends up dead.

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,680
Liu Ming proved that.

9
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
The passenger is on board.

10
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Captain He!

11
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Captain He!

12
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Captain He!

13
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,750
Captain He, look!

14
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,020
Notify the bomb squad.

15
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,310
Yes.

16
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,870
Director Feng.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,910
Bomb squad,

18
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,840
CIU requests backup.

19
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I don't believe

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,870
there's a real bomb.

21
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,590
Kill me, and the timer stops.

22
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,470
He Ya lives.

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Move!

24
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,340
Bomb!

25
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,710
- Run!
- Stop looking!

26
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,840
- Run!
- Move!

27
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Fall back!

28
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,030
Captain He!

29
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Fall back!

30
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Captain He!

31
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,400
Captain He, get down!

32
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,310
I'll go!

33
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,400
Get down! It's dangerous!

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,400
Captain He!

35
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,680
Captain He!

36
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,080
Before I detonate,

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,910
you still have a chance.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,710
What chance is that?

39
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,120
You should've put me

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
in that truck.

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,160
Lu Ran, I know

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
you're out of cards.

43
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,110
Yuan,

44
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,310
don't you want to say hi

45
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,480
to Ya?

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,840
Xu Jingzhi?

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Xu Jingzhi?

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm here.

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,310
I almost forgot.

50
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,270
He Ya is

51
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,680
the passenger inside.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,510
She's on a fuel tanker

53
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,390
parked in Lujia Village.

54
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,870
I'm going

55
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,710
to blow it.

56
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
Xu Jingzhi,

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,630
do what you should do.

58
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,800
Trust me.

59
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,920
You have to trust me, too.

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Shut up!

61
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,950
Who are you to order him?

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
You're just a puppet!

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Hello?

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Hello?

65
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,430
I only want to know

66
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,920
what you truly want to do.

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
Lu Ran,

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,870
none of them understands what you and I

69
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
have lived through.

70
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,470
No one.

71
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,070
What do you think I should do?

72
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,710
Kill me,

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,310
and the passenger survives.

74
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,270
You want me to kill you?

75
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,270
Inside that container,

76
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,190
you had the chance

77
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,390
to refuse being saved by me.

78
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,560
Why wait until today?

79
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,060
(Lujia Village)

80
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,560
Captain He,

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
this is Badge No. 016290,

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,970
here to help.

83
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,000
The road ahead is cleared.

84
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Copy that.

85
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,070
You still don't get it?

86
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,800
He Ya's about to die.

87
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,510
You might never even find

88
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,390
her bones.

89
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,360
Don't you hate me?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,920
Don't you want to shoot me dead?

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
Before I hate you,

92
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm still your brother.

93
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,950
Can hatred solve your problems?

94
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,600
Why not?

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,160
Zhang Yutong,

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Liu Wanyao, Shi Zelin.

97
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,000
All of them grew brave

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,190
because of hate!

99
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,600
I killed Zheng Xintao

100
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,390
to protect the other girls.

101
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,630
Back then,

102
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,630
why didn't anyone protect me?

103
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,040
I'll agree

104
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,310
to all your terms,

105
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,070
as long as you help me

106
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,830
kill them.

107
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,920
Have you thought it through?

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,120
If Wu Xinxin were alive,

109
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,150
she wouldn't want you

110
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,840
to become what you are now.

111
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,200
It's not just for her.

112
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,270
I'm avenging myself as well.

113
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,440
Has hatred made you braver?

114
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,600
Has it lifted

115
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,440
the weight of pain?

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
Lu Ran,

117
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,150
will blowing Lujia Village flat

118
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,550
repay your childhood?

119
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
There's a construction site 500 m ahead.

120
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
Captain He,
turn right into the open ground.

121
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Too close to living quarters.

122
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,720
I need somewhere safer.

123
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,360
Captain He, you're out of time.

124
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
It's too dangerous.

125
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,550
I'll head for the expressway.

126
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,570
Zhangyang Expressway
has a dead-end spur.

127
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,150
Hello, this is Command Center.

128
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,200
This is Command Center.

129
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
What's going on?

130
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,670
Okay.

131
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,750
Command Center,

132
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
no explosives were found

133
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,420
(Big-Data Platform)
in Wuyang University.

134
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,260
The threat is lifted.

135
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,150
Command Center,

136
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,630
no explosives were found

137
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,580
in Xinyuan Trade Center.

138
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,510
The threat is lifted.

139
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,550
Command Center,

140
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,870
no explosives were found

141
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,990
on the river-crossing bridge.

142
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,110
The threat is lifted.

143
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,390
Director Feng,

144
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,820
there's only the fuel tanker.

145
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,420
(Video link)
Captain He is driving it

146
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,140
to the Zhangyang Expressway, 2 km away.

147
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,550
Traffic and fire units

148
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,510
are setting

149
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,600
a cordon at the dead end.

150
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,510
Okay. Got it.

151
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,150
Any word from Xu Jingzhi?

152
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,840
No signal yet.

153
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
His locator's gone dark.

154
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,510
Badge No. 016290,

155
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,850
slow down and widen the distance.

156
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,790
Captain He, jump out!

157
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,390
Fire crews will take over.

158
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,550
Time's almost up.

159
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,790
Execute the order!

160
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,910
You still can't

161
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,360
understand how I feel.

162
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,600
It was you,

163
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,440
like a beam of light,

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
who led me out

165
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,630
of the gloomy Lu Village.

166
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
It was you who gave me

167
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,870
the strength to strike back.

168
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,030
In a life that should've been neglected,

169
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,270
there was suddenly hope.

170
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,790
While you were teaching me

171
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,720
how to stay calm and act rationally,

172
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,320
here I am.

173
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,000
Why am I still alive?

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,630
Why was I ever born?

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
All these years I've grown up,

176
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,790
who ever taught me?

177
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,000
Who ever taught me

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,840
about love and dignity?

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,120
My parents?

180
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,910
Or you who abandoned

181
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,480
and deceived me

182
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
for your own sake?

183
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,600
Wu Min once loved you.

184
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,550
I taught you.

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,870
He Ya taught you, too.

186
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,870
You chose the wrong path.

187
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,030
Lu Ran, hate me.

188
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,960
I don't hate you.

189
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,750
30 seconds!

190
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,660
(Lu Ran)

191
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,940
(Lu Ran)

192
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,480
Xu Jingzhi!

193
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,840
You have to believe me.

194
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,440
This is exactly right.

195
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,870
Better your hatred

196
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,080
than your indifference.

197
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,080
Only this way

198
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
can you feel what I feel.

199
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,240
Come on.

200
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,630

Lu Ran!

203
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,590
Lu Ran.

204
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,000
We're both trapped by the past.

205
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,910
Only now do I see

206
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,320
you've been waiting for me.

207
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,720
But you've already gone

208
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,870
too far wrong.

209
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,440
Putting on the cuffs

210
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,120
is the only thing I can still teach you.

211
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
I'm a lousy man.

212
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Forgive me, okay?

213
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,870

214
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,550

215

The police have recently confirmed

219
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,270
that Mai Boyuan,
Longyuan Group chairman,

220
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,550
is suspected of financial fraud,

221
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960
embezzlement of corporate assets,
human trafficking,

222
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160
and multiple other crimes.

223
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,440
Mai Boyuan

224
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,830
and related personnel

225
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,680
have been under investigation.

226
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,830
Up to the time of broadcast,

227
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,240
15 suspects have been arrested,

228
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,310
7 of whom

229
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,030
are Longyuan Group employees.

230
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,270
(Mai Boyuan is arrested)
The other eight are unemployed.

231
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,550
The case is still under trial.

232
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,640
Isn't that Jiao Yu?

233
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,920
The police have opened a hotline

234
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
How did he end up like this?

235
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,310
and an e-mail address.

236
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,510
The public may contact

237
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,070
the police to provide clues.

238
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,550
This program will

239
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,310
keep following the developments.

240
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,870
Yu,

241
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,110
the hospital has found

242
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,310
a matching kidney.

243
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,640
Tingting's transplant surgery

244
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,510
went smoothly.

245
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,310
There's no rejection so far.

246
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't worry.

247
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,920
When she's discharged,

248
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,070
we'll come see you.

249
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,430
Feifei,

250
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,960

253
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,550
Look.

254
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,030
This is me with Zelin.

255
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,240
Here's my number.

256
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,440
If anything happens to her,

257
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,300
call me.

258
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,160
Okay.

259
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Ma'am,

260
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,200
I haven't found Zelin.

261
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,640
Could you

262
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,750
give this to him first?

263
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,150
Sure.

264
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,670

320
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,110
- Don't eat them all.

into my line of sight.

347
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,590

348

00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,790
but I felt nothing.

would give

360
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,640
a monologue like this?

361
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,920

362
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,310
a serial murderer.

363
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,830
But Mr. Xu's answer

364
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
is never that simple.

365
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
Can any of you

366
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,920
give a less simple answer?

367
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,430
Mr. Xu,

368
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,960
besides a psychopathic murderer,

369
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,070
this monologue

370
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,680
could also come

371
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,680
from a battle-hardened soldier.

372
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,510

373

Don't run.

382

- Don't move.
- What?

383
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,200
- What?
- Don't move.

384
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,040
Stay put.

385
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,350
Alright.

386
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,830
Today's drill is over.

387
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,240
All units, go back and review.

388
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
Wei.

389
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,790
Call me Yin from now on.

390
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,320
What's wrong?

391
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,560
Yin,

392
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,270
the body's here.

393
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,310
How can you be sure

394
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,960
this is the primary crime scene?

395
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,750
How did you deduce

396
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,790
from footprints alone

397
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,110
that the murderer isn't local?

398
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,070
And how did you and Captain He know

399
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,270
the murderer was on site?

400
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,880
The top of the written exam, right?

401
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,000
How did you know?

402
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,270
What did I

403
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,110
give away?

404
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,540
Where's the voice recorder?

405
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,510
What do you want to know?

406
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,870
Let's go for a walk.

407
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,480
From now on, you'll meet

408
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,550
plenty of oddballs

409
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,640
with unique skills.

410
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,240
Get used to it.

411
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,110
We don't label them psychos

412
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,920
in a bad way.

413
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,240
Why?

414
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,070
Because they benefit society,

415
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,270
not harm it.

416
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,590
That's a sociological

417
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
and utilitarian view.

418
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,680
It's not psychology.

419
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,920
They aren't born this way,

420
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,590
nor shaped by environment,

421
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,550
but by job demand.

422
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,030
So, they stay rational.

423
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,070
It's because of faith.

424
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,880
No rule is

425
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,440
flawless enough

426
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,030
to deliver absolute justice.

427
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,110
Ordinary people can look away

428
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,350
and retreat,

429
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,720
but we

430
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,070
can't stop chasing

431
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
that absoluteness,

432
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,790
because the rule of law is

433
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,350
our society's bottom line.

434
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,200
We often hear:

435
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Who fights dragons

436
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,640
becomes a dragon.

437
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,070
To me,

438
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,920
the line between justice and evil

439
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,680
is faith,

440
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,720
not ability,

441
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,590
not whether you fit

442
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,070
normal standards.

443
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,720
Trust your beliefs.

444
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,590
You must forge yourselves

445
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,790
from ordinary people

446
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,830
into ones who exceed

447
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,110
normal psychology.

448
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,350
Overcome fear,

449
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,070
overcome rage,

450
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,440
and endure pain

451
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,440
to be fit for this job.

452
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,060
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

453
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,860
(Erected by elder brother Xu Jingzhi)

454
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,580
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

455
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,340
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

456
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,630
Hurry over!

457
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,110
Come here!

458
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,880
Uncle, you don't fit in.

459
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,030
I can tell you don't either.

460
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm just too excellent.

461
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,320
What is excellence?

462
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,070
Loneliness.

463
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,110
Not all excellent people

464
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,550
are lonely.

465
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,440
You have

466
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,920
many better choices.

467
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,920
Sit down where you are.

468
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Wei Zixuan!

469
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,460
Okay? Here.

470
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,200
You can toss it.

471
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,440
Wei Zixuan,

472
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,400
classmates and teachers
are looking for you.

473
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,280
Let's go.

474
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,280
We've got a new game.

475
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,800
Who told you to find me?

476
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,350
Uncle,

477
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,840
let me think.

478
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,400
Go find a spot and toss first.

479
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,790
(Zhang Yutong: Zhang)

480
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,830
(lost control of herself)

481
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,470
(while killing.)

482
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,610
(Not criminally responsible.)

483
