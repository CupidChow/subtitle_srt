=Supersensory Maze=

2
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,760
(I always spot)

4
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,040
(the odd ones out too easily.)

5
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
(Every person has an evil obsession.)

6
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,640
(It may be tiny,)

7
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,400
(and it may hide deep.)

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,020
(I can become an anchor)

9
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,860
(for each dark urge.)

10
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,100
(Chemistry)

11
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,120
(I never expected)

12
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,520
(company on this road.)

13
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,910
(When I first met Lu Ran,)

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,000
(we only leaned on each other)

15
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
(because we were weak.)

16
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,800
(When I finally grew up)

17
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,560
(and tried to teach him how to be)

18
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,800
(an upright man,)

19
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,750
(he chose to leave.)

20
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,630
Not seeing me off?

21
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,710
Let it be.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,630
(When He Ya also decided)

23
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,080
(to walk away from our marriage,)

24
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,000
(I realized)

25
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,360
(there is)

26
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
(no once-and-for-all way)

27
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,400
(to keep the right people.)

28
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,800
(Life is always unpredictable;)

29
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,690
(it offers no result.)

30
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,750
(So, I bought)

31
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,870
(Wu Min's old house)

32
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,000
(the crime scene)

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,270
(that trapped me in obsession.)

34
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,430
(Only by touching
the unanswered questions)

35
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,510
(can I return to a normal life.)

36
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,000
(He suffers the same pain I do;)

37
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,600
(a pain that makes life
worse than death.)

38
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,480
(Perhaps what keeps pain at bay)

39
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,510
(isn't happiness,)

40
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,920
(but addiction.)

41
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,480
(And addiction usually ends)

42
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,390
(in death.)

43
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,040
I've made up my mind.

44
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,800
When do we do it?

45
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,870
I'll give you another vial
of my bio-data,

46
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,000
in case you need it.

47
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,520
My company's DNA bank

48
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,270
is linked nationwide.

49
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,430
Once it's altered,
you'll be Zhuang Mingcheng.

50
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,830
DNA is only data

51
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,750
in the end.

52
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,560
If I can tamper with it,

53
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
it's my parents

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,750
signaling me to join them.

55
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,950
No one in this world cares about me.

56
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,190
I'm just going to reunite

57
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,120
with them.

58
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
Aren't you curious

59
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,830
what I'll do with your identity?

60
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,600
Not interested.

61
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,870
I hate the name Zhuang Mingcheng.

62
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,800
I doubt

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
your fate under that name

64
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,950
will be better than mine.

65
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,710
Lu Ran,

66
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,230
do you know

67
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,750
that sometimes,

68
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,800
one wrong step

69
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,000
is the point of no return.

70
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,070
Is this you?

71
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,670
Yes.

72
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,150
Do you like it?

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,720
It's brilliant.

74
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,040
Would you let us show it

75
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,600
at our art exhibition?

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
It belongs in a museum.

77
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,930
Of course, I'd be delighted.

78
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,070
Nothing could be luckier.

79
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,950
Is that you?

80
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,080
Then who is this?

81
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,190
Someone far away from me.

82
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,510
I know the man

83
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,450
beside Jiang Yongquan.

84
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,800
I can help you.

85
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,800
(When no one can make you happy,)

86
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,800
(you start wanting pain.)

87
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
(It's the only thing)

88
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,510
(that makes me feel alive.)

89
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
(I accept this fate,)

90
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,510
(even if,)

91
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,840
(like every bad habit,)

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,360
(it will destroy me.)

93
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
(Everyone still has)

94
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,270
(a chance to choose good.)

95
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,270
(The choice)

96
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,080
(has always been in their own hands.)

97
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,630
(But for what you've done wrong,)

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,720
(you must bear the consequence)

99
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,240
(and pay the price)

100
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
(to reach the path of good.)

101
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,440
(My existence is the result of evil.)

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
(Returning to Wuyang)

103
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
(means seeking the source of that evil.)

104
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,080
(Every single person)

105
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,270
(in this trafficking chain)

106
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,790
(must suffer the backlash
of their malice.)

107
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
(Real life is built)

108
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,270
(on rational moral norms.)

109
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,630
(Law is the bottom line of morality,)

110
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
(unforced by survival,)

111
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,200
(unswayed by desire.)

112
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,240
(I finally understand what home means.)

113
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,120
(Home is fate:)

114
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,840
(After countless choices,)

115
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,120
(you still walk the inevitable road.)

116
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,240
(Whether fortunate or not,)

117
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,320
(it is where you belong)

118
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,550
(like marrow in your bone.)

119
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
You're done?

120
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,440
Yes.

121
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,720
So comfortable.

122
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,130
I wanted to let you know:

123
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
The child's treatment fee has arrived.

124
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,600
- Yes.
- Thank you.

125
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,480
Really, thank you.

126
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,670
Thank you.

127
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
Don't mention it.

128
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Uncle Jiao.

129
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,480
From now on, if I ever need help

130
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,360
and come to you,

131
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,960
please don't refuse.

132
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Don't worry.

133
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
From this day on,

134
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll do

135
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,040
whatever you ask.

136
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,720
You're too kind.

137
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,750
But the hospital says

138
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,270
we still have to wait for an organ.

139
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,510
How long will it be?

140
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,390
Usually

141
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,550
three to five years.

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Three to five years?

143
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,200
Money doesn't work?

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,510
This isn't a vegetable market.

145
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,510
What has to match is a kidney.

146
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,040
Besides,

147
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
we can't just grab

148
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,150
someone off the street

149
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,240
and cut out their kidney, right?

150
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,360
Right, of course.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm just afraid

152
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,840
the child won't make it.

153
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
Don't worry.

154
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,390
Leave it with me.

155
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,720
I'll see what else I can do.

156
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
Great.

157
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,240
Thank you.

158
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,510
Time for work.

159
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,390
I've got to go.

160
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,510
Treat this place

161
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,270
as your own home.

162
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,540
Make yourself comfortable.

163
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,600
You're our benefactor.

164
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
You go ahead.

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,640
Yu, eat something before you leave.

166
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,630
I've got to get

167
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,610
to the plant early today.

168
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,840
Now that we have money,

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
I'll tell the guys

170
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,030
to stop the collection.

171
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,630
Go ahead.

172
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,790
I'm off. Bye.

173
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,720
Take care, Yu.

174
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,870
What about his girl?

175
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,390
I'll bring it to the hospital later.

176
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,320
Let's eat first.

177
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,870
I never saw

178
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,840
a fish this big when I was little.

179
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,170
This is nothing.

180
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,070
My dad and my brother
caught even bigger ones.

181
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,360
Xi,

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
you've been away so long.

183
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,870
Are you missing your family?

184
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,110
No.

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,720
You eat; I'll get some rice.

186
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,280
Yes, yes.

187
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,510
That's him.

188
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,720
The one who contacted me wasn't him.

189
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,280
This guy said

190
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,100
a friend of his wanted to kill himself,

191
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
and nothing could stop him,

192
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,910
but he knew the location

193
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
and asked me to rush over to save him,

194
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,450
saying he'd race back himself.

195
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,060
(Lie Reef; Red buoy)

196
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,120
Who contacted you?

197
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,240
I never saw him.

198
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
He paid up front

199
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,440
and sounded desperate.

200
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,240
It was a life hanging by a thread,

201
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,790
so I didn't think twice.

202
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
Did he call again?

203
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,630
With so many boats,

204
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,480
he asked for an unlicensed one.

205
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,070
Didn't you get suspicious?

206
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,000
I did,

207
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,320
but saving a man came first.

208
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,510
I...

209
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,600
Is this the number?

210
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
You found him?

211
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,610
Where did you drop him?

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,840
On the shore.

213
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,390
He said he'd come to his senses;

214
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,550
his friend also called,

215
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,690
saying everything was fine.

216
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,150
He picked an empty stretch of bank

217
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,990
and got on.

218
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,750
I can still remember roughly where.

219
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Yin.

220
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,360
How is it?

221
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Nothing here.

222
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,510
Your side?

223
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,800
Keep going.

224
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,590
Let's go.

225
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,200
Lu Haitao of Lujia Village,

226
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,540
can someone
who once sheltered abductors

227
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,840
and ran prostitution

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,390
be the village secretary?

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,150
Who are you?

230
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,000
Who on earth are you?

231
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,790
Don't talk nonsense.

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
You did terrible things

233
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,120
and bribed the villagers.

234
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,200
If you don't want anyone

235
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
to find out about this,

236
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
do exactly as I say.

237
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,510
What do you need?

238
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you want?

239
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,870
Make a phone call.

240
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
That's all?

241
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,790
Captain He Ya,

242
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
CIU 1, Wuyang PSB.

243
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,630
You've got her number, right?

244
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,920
(Police)
Okay.

245
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,390
Okay, thanks.

246
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,480
The local station confirms it:

247
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,540
Zhuang Mingcheng did stay
in the fishing village

248
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,200
for several days.

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,030
Yin Wei, come with me
to the village again.

250
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,600
Xu Jingzhi, you stay.

251
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,480
All this effort

252
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,030
just to earn a shred

253
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,550
of his approval.

254
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,430
You don't understand.

255
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,170
He'll never give it to you.

256
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,640
Without trying,

257
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,370
how do you know it won't work?

258
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,720
When will you give up?

259
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,720
No matter when,

260
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,550
I won't stop looking for him.

261
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,270
I don't know

262
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,240
what give up means.

263
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,200
Sir.

264
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
Speak.

265
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,560
The boat's ready.

266
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,960
IDs are at the rendezvous.

267
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,240
I've stashed a few extras

268
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,350
just in case.

269
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,030
You can leave any time.

270
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,560
Good.

271
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,590
Sir,

272
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,640
take care.

273
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,030
I've settled everything here.

274
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,850
Once the ship hits international waters,

275
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,050
you'll be safe.

276
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,760
Understood.

277
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,240
Hello?

278
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,110
Who is this?

279
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,110
Hello,

280
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,350
we're the police.

281
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,200
What can I do for you?

282
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,240
Do you know this man?

283
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
He's our great benefactor.

284
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,000
What's the matter?

285
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,400
Where is he now?

286
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,870
No idea.

287
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,960
He went out after breakfast.

288
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,110
Really.

289
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,880
Why would I lie to you?

290
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,510
The doctor just called.

291
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,790
It's a miracle.

292
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,790
Check

293
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,370
if there's any source available.

294
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,550
Get it arranged right away.

295
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,510
Hurry up.

296
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,110
Don't forget to say thank you.

297
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,110
Okay, bye.

298
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,420
(Consignor: Li Ming; Cargo: Organ)

299
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,100
(Wuxi Chemical Plant; Lujia Village)

300
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,720
Hello?

301
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,400
So, have you thought it over?

302
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,640
Your silence

303
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,790
tells me you're listening.

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,310
Let me spell it out for you:

305
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,920
Inside your waste center,

306
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,640
you've got two tons of banned waste

307
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,680
in tanker trucks,

308
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,680
ready to roll anytime.

309
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,790
If I remember right,

310
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,750
your shift starts

311
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,070
in an hour.

312
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,550
You'll deliver them.

313
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,640
No, listen...

314
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,480
Jiao Yu,

315
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,070
I brought your package here.

316
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,270
What I prepared for you

317
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,110
has arrived.

318
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,520
Don't be scared.

319
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,880
You only need to drop it in.

320
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,270
What are you trying to do?

321
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,480
What do you want?

322
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,590
Remember what you promised

323
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,650
your wife on her deathbed

324
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,200
that you'd take care of your daughter?

325
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,400
The money is a sign of my good faith.

326
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,070
The kidney match is already here.

327
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,350
Hello?

328
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,680
Are you going

329
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,720
to watch her die?

330
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,840
Don't say that.

331
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,350
My daughter won't die.

332
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,880
She has to live.

333
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,350
She must live.

334
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,160
The plane lands in 15 minutes.

335
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,000
The organ's on board.

336
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,400
We can start the transplant anytime.

337
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,510
If you don't want it,

338
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,480
I'll let it rot,

339
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,640
but don't forget

340
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,880
how hard it is to find

341
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
a compatible donor.

342
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,270
They refused at first.

343
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,350
I'm the one

344
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,160
who got it for you.

345
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,480
I can't.

346
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,960
I can't do this.

347
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,000
Really.

348
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,440
Something huge will happen.

349
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,070
I beg you.

350
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,910
Please let me go.

351
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
I can do something else

352
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,350
for you.

353
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,240
Anything.

354
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,110
Whatever you need.

355
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,080
Anything.

356
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,070
My goal is simple.

357
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,680
I don't care about the process.

358
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,640
I can't.

359
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,160
I can't do this.

360
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,270
Put the igniter

361
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,590
into the waste center,

362
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,630
or

363
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,160
use your professional skill

364
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,400
to turn it

365
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,430
into an accident.

366
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,390
Hello?

367
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,000
Yuan,

368
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,480
you always know me best.

369
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,030
You found this place at once.

370
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,320
Lu Ran,

371
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,830
you're no fun.

372
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,400
Did you see the gift I left you?

373
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,110
Yes.

374
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,150
Oh, right.

375
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,680
I forgot to mention:

376
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,750
You've got one last place to visit.

377
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,160
What do you want?

378
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,590
If you don't show up,

379
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,960
I'll detonate the explosives.

380
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,440
I'll wait for you.

381
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,950
Lu Ran?

382
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Eat up.

383
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,020
(Zhuang Mingcheng)

384
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,160
The plane's landing.

385
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,590
Eat up.

386
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,720
Take your time.

387
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,790
The meal's not bad, huh?

388
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,510
You're incredibly lucky.

389
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,860
Exactly.

390
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,050
One word from your benefactor

391
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,220
made the money that was supposed
to take three months

392
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,860
arrive in less than a week.

393
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,590
Organs are trickier, though.

394
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,720
Why not ask

395
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
your benefactor for another favor?

396
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,350
What more can he ask?

397
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,170
I heard plenty of people wait

398
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,750
till they die and still don't get one.

399
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,720
Stop talking nonsense.

400
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,640
Sorry, sorry.

401
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,640
I'm done.

402
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,030
You guys carry on.

403
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,110
I've got to go.

404
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,830
Watch your mouth.

405
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,160
Think before you speak.

406
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,140
(Captain He)

407
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,040
Hello?

408
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,680
Is this Captain He Ya?

409
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,520
Who's calling?

410
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,270
Lu Haitao from Lujia Village.

411
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,960
We met when you came

412
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,800
to the village.

413
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,530
What can I do for you?

414
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,790
I'm reporting a crime.

415
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,590
Someone just called,

416
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,890
saying a bomb's been planted

417
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,750
in Lujia Village.

418
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,920
When I tried to call back,

419
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,240
the phone was already off.

420
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,590
Did he say

421
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,430
where the bomb is?

422
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,000
No.

423
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,880
He only said that one line and hung up.

424
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,000
I have no idea

425
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,310
if it's real or a hoax.

426
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,030
Has anyone suspicious come

427
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,030
to your village lately?

428
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,100
Off the top of my head,

429
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,370
I can't think of anyone.

430
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,310
How about this, Captain He?

431
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,310
I'll walk around the village

432
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,490
and take another look.

433
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,030
All right. Stay safe.

434
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,070
We'll get there asap.

435
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,240
Please send me the number

436
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,350
that just called you.

437
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,380
(Recipient: Captain He)

438
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,080
Come in.

439
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,900
Director Feng.

440
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,550
More bomb threats
from Wuyang University,

441
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,490
Xinyuan Trade Center,

442
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,600
the river-crossing bridge,
and the fishing village.

443
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,160
That makes four locations so far.

444
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,310
All the places

445
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,400
Zhuang Mingcheng has been.

446
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,050
Nearest specialists are already on-site

447
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,890
for searches.

448
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,070
The unfinished building blew up.

449
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,160
Comrade Liu Ming died.

450
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,000
We cannot allow

451
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,590
people's lives or property

452
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,920
to be threatened again.

453
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,110
Notify every department:

454
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Search meticulously.

455
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,350
Control every risk.

456
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,190
Yes.

457
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,790
Director Feng,

458
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,110
Lujia Village may have a bomb.

459
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,070
I'm heading there now.

460
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,550
Fire crews have been told.

461
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,270
Check if it's real

462
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,680
and whether it's a trap
set by Zhuang Mingcheng.

463
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,520
Sure.

464
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,550
Shiqi, I just sent you

465
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,400
a phone number.

466
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
Trace

467
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,200
its location.

468
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Get out at the next junction;

469
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,620
Li Long will ride with me.

470
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,950
You take your team to the plant.

471
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,230
Find Jiao Yu no matter what.

472
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,850
As expected, he didn't plan

473
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,980
to spare Lujia Village.

474
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,510
Be extremely careful.

475
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,480
Finally off work.

476
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,180
(Explosive)

477
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:06,220
(Wuxi Chemical Plant)

478
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,660
(Flammable liquid; Explosive)

479
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,740
(Flammable liquid; Explosive)

480
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,010
Captain He.

481
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,520
(Lujia Village)
You're here at last.

482
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,490
Anything so far?

483
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,550
I walked the whole village

484
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,750
and found a big truck

485
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,130
that doesn't belong to anyone here.

486
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,750
Let's go have a look.

487
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,940
- Sure.
- Let's go.

488
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,740
(Big-Data Intelligence Center)

489
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,470
Jiao Yu!

490
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,100
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

491
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,120
I...

492
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,840
My daughter is so little.

493
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,800
She can't die.

494
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,280
I finally found a matching kidney.

495
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,110
I have to save her.

496
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,630
I have to save my girl.

497
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,070
I can't see the people clearly now.

498
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,920
We're getting higher and higher.

499
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,920
Surely, everything's a blur.

500
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,960
Watch the direction they walk,

501
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,150
and you'll know

502
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,440
where they're headed.

503
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,150
I envy the place they're going.

504
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,880
No one feels hated there.

505
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,670
You think your mother

506
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,230
hates you,

507
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,120
right?

508
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,960
Not completely.

509
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
Yuan,

510
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,710
you treat me

511
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,030
differently from them.

512
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,920
In her eyes, I shouldn't exist at all.

513
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,190
Give her time.

514
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,190
She loves you.

515
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,230
But if she pushes you away

516
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,320
and even insults you,

517
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,710
how do we fit in

518
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,960
and still respect her?

519
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,480
She can't give me

520
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,320
the home you once described.

521
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,800
You're smart.

522
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,070
You'll realize

523
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,760
goodness is human nature.

524
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,480
Until then,

525
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,920
hold on to hope.

526
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,510
The stuff is off the clock.

527
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,920
Why are you still inside?

528
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,670
Did they forget you?

529
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,150
