1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,980
What did he say to you?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,280
He said he liked me.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,890
The Enchanté book?

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,300
How come you have it?

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,590
Phupha practiced writing the word ‘Enchanté’ just to deceive you.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,000
I know you approached me because you’re scared you wouldn’t get the scholarship.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,670
From what he said, he isn’t the real Enchanté.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,010
He might be implying that it’s himself,

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,350
Wayo,

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,590
or Saifa.

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,310
Or none of them.

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,470
By the way, what are you doing here all alone?

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,750
I already know who Enchanté is.

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,230
You must help me first.

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,600
Help what now?

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,660
Find me a chamber for an art exhibition.

17
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,200
If Theo is mad, you can just apologize.

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,710
My sister made Khai Palo. She asked me to give it to you.

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,540
Yum yum!

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Romantic movies are always with kiss scenes.

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,910
If they kiss because of love, that’s okay.

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,940
If not,

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,310
it should be hard.

24
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,820
Do you want me to kiss you?

25
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,930
What did you say?

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,840
Akk!

27
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,640
You’re all talk.

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,070
You won’t dare.

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,570
Theo,

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,060
you shouldn't
do this to anyone.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Theo.

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,250
Did you just say I wouldn't dare?

33
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,370
Students,

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,890
I'm locking down the building.

35
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,710
The light is soon to be turned off.

36
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,720
Let's go.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,610
The university staff
is asking us to leave.

38
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,830
Theo.

39
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,490
What?

40
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,860
What's wrong?
Why are you so quiet?

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,390
You've been silent all the way here.

42
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,230
Nothing.

43
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,720
I'm just...

44
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,610
sleepy.

45
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,330
Go home and rest then.

46
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Theo.

47
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,900
Theo!

48
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,520
Yes, Mom.

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,970
Your dad is talking to you.
Are you hearing him?

50
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,490
What did you say, Dad?

51
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,650
I said I saw the
Zine Fair you held.

52
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,110
The university staff
sent me some pictures.

53
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,390
Many people have attended.

54
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,070
Yes.

55
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,910
Looks like many students
are interested in the event.

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,100
We got unexpected feedback.

57
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,730
I haven't seen it yet.

58
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,350
Do you mind sharing
some photos or videos?

59
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,510
Not at all.

60
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Here you go.

61
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
He's looking great.

62
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,320
The song he played,
he wrote it himself.

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,140
Yeah?

64
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,690
Interesting.

65
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,630
He's also good-looking.

66
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,250
A guy like this can be a star just fine.

67
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,860
We can't tell if the folks attending
the event are more interested in
the Literature Major or the singer.

68
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,120
Um...

69
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,290
But you did great, Theo.

70
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,930
I'll talk to the head of the major later.

71
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,150
Okay?

72
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,080
Yes, dad.

73
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Well done.

74
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Wait for Akk a little longer.

75
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,350
He slept in.

76
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,130
Why didn't you
give me a wake-up call?

77
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,110
We're late.

78
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,110
Come on.

79
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,390
Theo,

80
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,110
why are you staring at me?

81
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,540
What?

82
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,460
Is it something on my face?

83
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,980
Do I still have eye boogers?

84
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
I don't.

85
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,780
What is it?

86
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
Hey.

87
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,730
Last night at the university...

88
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,660
Why?

89
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,670
I think I had a weird dream.

90
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,430
Did I do anything in my sleep?

91
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
There's something you did.

92
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,670
You snored.

93
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,790
Very loudly, I'm telling you.

94
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,930
You're the one that snored.

95
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,870
Not me for sure.

96
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,430
What were you dreaming about?

97
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,660
Can't remember.

98
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,340
Just forget it.

99
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,200
I know you approached me

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,690
because you're scared you
wouldn't get the scholarship.

101
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,930
Who told you that?

102
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,210
Was it Natee?

103
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,980
I'm giving you a
chance to step away from Theo.

104
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,060
Otherwise,
I'll be the one exposing you.

105
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,580
It's not you either.

106
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,470
I'll find the real
Enchanté and expose you.

107
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,200
Isn't Saifa here?

108
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
Saifa hasn't come
to the club for a while.

109
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,560
He said he'd write songs in his room.

110
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,840
Thank you so much
for helping me clean up.

111
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,980
No need to thank me.

112
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,410
It's my pleasure.

113
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,080
Labor jobs are my specialty.

114
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,110
I told you

115
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,550
whatever it is,

116
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,110
you can always talk to me.

117
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,980
[Don't be bored. You can
always talk to me. - Enchanté]

118
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Hey, guys.

119
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,280
Take one.

120
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Here you go.

121
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,010
The Zine Fair is over.

122
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,000
I guess you have some
time tomorrow evening?

123
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,460
Yes.

124
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,860
Do you need anything?

125
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,940
I was wondering if you
wanted to come watch me play.

126
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,330
It's a big match.

127
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,070
Ton,

128
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,320
will you get to play tomorrow?

129
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,280
Hey, don't underestimate me.

130
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,450
I'm on the substitute list.

131
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,820
It might be the first time
I get to be in the field.

132
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,970
Then I'll be there rooting for
you on the bleacher, buddy.

133
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,890
For real?

134
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,030
Yes.

135
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,290
That's my man.

136
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
Well...

137
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,490
I'll be there tomorrow.

138
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Looking forward to seeing you.

139
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Akk.

140
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,630
Akk!

141
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,780
I haven't got a drink yet.

142
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,490
Why didn't you tell me?

143
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,820
I'll go get it for you.

144
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,330
No need.

145
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
You can have mine.

146
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,740
Drink from the same bottle?

147
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,580
If you don't mind.

148
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Thank you.

149
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,330
I'll do my best tomorrow.

150
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,820
You can do it.

151
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,580
Wayo!

152
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,900
Say whatever you need.

153
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,700
I have football practice.

154
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,560
Are you the real Enchanté?

155
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,800
Listen to you.

156
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,770
Are you admitting you're not?

157
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm asking the question.
All you need to do is answer.

158
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,330
The more you whine, the more I
want to know what happened.

159
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,580
If you don't answer,
you're not Enchanté.

160
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,400
Then I have nothing to say to you.

161
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,510
I'm Enchanté.

162
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,430
Are you sure?

163
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,020
I am.

164
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,210
Then why didn't you approach
Theo at all at the Zine Fair?

165
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,370
I was waiting for the fair to
be over before I talked to him.

166
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,600
Theo asked us for that.

167
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,840
That's why I didn't
bother him like you did.

168
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,930
I'm the real one.

169
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,450
If you're the real one,

170
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,540
the rest lied.

171
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,690
Including you, right?

172
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,410
It doesn't matter.

173
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,980
But right now,

174
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,470
Natee is making Theo believe
that he's the real Enchanté.

175
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
He's using Theo.

176
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
Using?

177
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,890
For what?

178
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm not sure.

179
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,550
But if you are the real Enchanté,
you must help me.

180
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,530
How can I help?

181
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,290
Here.

182
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,020
Eat and lift up your mood.

183
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,500
No.

184
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm not in the mood to eat.

185
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,760
Just have some.

186
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,460
Or I'll just keep holding it like this.

187
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,260
Theo, I'm having a cramp.

188
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,580
Help me!

189
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,810
I have a cramp!

190
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,050
Theo,

191
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,040
if the Te-Te guy
makes you feel this tired,

192
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,780
how about you stop looking for him?

193
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,720
Why?

194
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,910
Don't you want to help me anymore?

195
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,560
Just say you're lazy.

196
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,990
No.

197
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,170
But Phupha tricked you.

198
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,830
And now it's Natee.

199
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:42,310
I feel like anyone using Enchanté
thing as leverage can manipulate you.

200
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,060
I don't want you to get fooled, Theo.

201
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,630
Thank you for your concern.

202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,970
I'll not let anyone use
Enchanté to deceive me anymore.

203
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Let's just eat for now.

204
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,620
Don't worry about it.

205
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,160
Put your mind at ease. Take it easy.

206
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,990
You got something there.

207
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,160
Where?

208
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,860
Here.

209
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,430
Right here.

210
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,550
You're perfect for the word 'little bro.'

211
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,200
Little bro, my ass.

212
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
It's right here.

213
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,950
It's still there?

214
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,370
It isn't easy to come off.

215
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
You eat like a baby.

216
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,390
Well, it's just so good.

217
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,420
Crisp crisp.

218
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,710
That's all you got.

219
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,680
You can't take all.

220
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,270
Can't you just share?

221
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,520
That's enough.
You're eating too much.

222
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,140
Are you that stingy?

223
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,630
Come on. Stop eating.

224
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,140
That's all you can have.

225
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,540
Fine.

226
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,190
I'll buy myself a new one.

227
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
A little to the left.

228
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Too much. Just one centimeter.

229
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,150
It's the first time
we get to exhibit these.

230
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,560
Your plan is clever,

231
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,370
asking the university
owner's son for help.

232
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,090
Otherwise, we can never get it.

233
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,720
Natee.

234
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,720
We need to talk.

235
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,190
Speak.

236
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Tan, go wait outside.

237
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,850
I know you told
Theo that I'm not Enchanté.

238
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,000
Because you're really not.

239
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,290
You're not either.

240
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,980
How do you know I'm not?

241
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,320
This exhibition room.

242
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,620
You tricked Theo into helping.

243
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,710
You approached him in the first place
because your club is about to get canceled.

244
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,410
Having an exhibition helps
you and your club to survive.

245
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
You think you know

246
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,620
but you might not know everything.

247
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,760
At least I know

248
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,950
you're not Enchanté.

249
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,340
There's so much more you don't know.

250
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,050
I know enough.

251
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,450
If you dare to fool Theo again,

252
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,800
you'll have to deal with me.

253
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Now that you're here.

254
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,180
How about you help me
set up all these pictures?

255
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
You're so beautiful.

256
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,770
Grow up fast, baby.

257
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,880
Be a nice girl to
your daddy here, okay?

258
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,640
You're such a gorgeous rose.

259
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,820
I'll take care of you, baby.

260
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
You're pretty.

261
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,120
So pretty.

262
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,680
Akk.

263
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
You can even talk to yourself now?

264
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,890
I'm not talking to myself.

265
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm talking to my baby rose.

266
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,070
Yeah?

267
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,260
Are you Snow White to
talk to the trees and nature?

268
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,970
And where did you get it from?

269
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,280
An exhibition chamber in the university.

270
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,570
I was afriad it'd die.

271
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,480
So I brought it here.

272
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,090
It will die because of you.

273
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,270
Everything you touch always dies.

274
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,120
That's when I was little.

275
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,450
I'm a grown man now.

276
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,670
This baby will never die in my hands.

277
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
I'll keep an eye on you.

278
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,340
I give it three days until it's gone.

279
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,710
Live the fullest life for now, rose.

280
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,510
Don't listen to Im.

281
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,970
You will survive, baby.

282
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,510
(Will you take this fox
traveling with you, Theo?)

283
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,750
(Of course.)

284
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,760
I will come back to you very soon.

A senior from university.

Very melodious.

320
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,890
Saifa sent it to me.

321
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,500
Is it about Enchanté again?

322
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,090
He just sent it to me out of nowhere.

323
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,210
I guess it's about Enchanté.

324
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,630
My mom said she can tell right
away what he feels towards me.

325
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,240
Do you think he's the real Enchanté?

326
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,280
Even the guy you thought was the right
one turned out to be the wrong one.

327
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,980
I can't possibly
find the answer for you.

328
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,360
You should just stop
looking for him. Trust me.

329
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,140
I really want to know.

330
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,480
We had four candidates before.

331
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,120
But Phupha isn't
in the choices anymore.

332
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,550
We now have just three candidates.

333
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,180
And what if the
three aren't Enchanté?

334
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,730
Then I will know why they lie to me.

335
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
Come on.

336
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,790
We're getting closer to the truth.

337
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,140
Don't leave me along the way.

338
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,180
All right.

339
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm just fed up.

340
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,170
If you want to keep looking,

341
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,450
I won't let you do it alone.

342
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,320
I need to go to this exhibition.

343
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,640
Want to come?

344
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
I need to get to class.
I have a quiz.

345
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,020
Go take a quiz then.

346
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,320
I'll go by myself.

347
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,710
Do your best.

348
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah.

349
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,990
Do you want to wait?

350
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,430
That's fine.

351
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,980
I don't want to wait any longer.

352
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,460
I want to know who Enchanté is.

353
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,060
Um.

354
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,210
See you.

355
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,790
You came so early, Theo.

356
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,730
I was looking for you.

357
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,790
And I was looking
forward to seeing you.

358
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,840
I'm glad you came to my exhibition.

359
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,110
I lost my passion to draw

360
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,350
but you brought
that passion back to me

361
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,980
Me?

362
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,780
Um.

363
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,780
I saw you for the
first time in the library.

364
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,970
(The light

365
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,850
and every angle at
the moment was so beautiful.)

366
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,670
It was so beautiful that I
wanted to capture it in an artwork.

367
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,340
After that, my passion to
draw was brought back to life.

368
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Everything...

369
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,710
happened because of you, Theo.

370
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,180
You found me the chamber.

371
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,880
Whichever piece you like,
just let me know.

372
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,140
There's no need.

373
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,440
I helped you because you
know what I want to know.

374
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,480
That's all.

375
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,590
Who is Enchanté?

376
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,820
You want to know that, right?

377
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,300
Of course.

378
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,830
If not, why would I be here?

379
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,400
Do you really know who Enchanté is?

380
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,390
It's me.

381
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Or maybe not.

382
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
If you want to find out,

383
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,460
go inside and see it for yourself.

384
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,940
Just tell me already.

385
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,880
Take a few steps inside
and you'll get the answer.

386
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,920
Don't you want it?

387
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,900
You could finally make
him come to your exhibition.

388
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,850
Questions and curiosity can
make humans do anything.

389
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
You're good, I must give you that.

390
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,210
You know me.

391
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,500
When I take interest in something,
I won't back off so easily.

392
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,510
He drew so many pictures of me.
Is he a psychopathic stalker?

393
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,610
Now you know if I really know or not.

394
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,470
Just a picture of someone
writing with his left hand.

395
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,520
Anyone can just assume that.

396
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,900
It doesn't even tell me who Enchanté is.

397
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,080
You want me to say it directly?

398
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Where's the fun in that?

399
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Do you think I'm having fun here?

400
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,760
If it isn't fun, you won't be standing here.

401
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,950
Am I right?

402
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Do you know the answer now?

403
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,240
No.

404
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,000
Why not?

405
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Natee said he knew.

406
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,380
He told me I'd find the
answer when I saw his drawing.

407
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,000
What drawing?

408
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,740
A drawing of someone's left
hand writing the word 'Enchanté.'

409
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,930
Ah! So the Enchanté guy is a lefty.

410
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,130
Yes.

411
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,990
Every handwriting we collected
was written with right hands.

412
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,540
That's why they don't match.

413
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,960
What I know for sure is
that Phupha isn't Enchanté.

414
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
Natee isn't either.

415
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,200
That leaves us with Wayo and Saifa.

416
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,860
Thank you all for visiting my exhibition.

417
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,350
Any problems or queries you
may have, please let me know.

418
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,360
I'm happy for you for being
able to create artwork again.

419
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,090
You were right to use
Enchanté stuff to get Theo's help.

420
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,350
Without his father's connection,
we would never get to use this room.

421
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm concerned about him though.

422
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,440
He seems too obsessed
with the Enchanté thing.

423
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,650
Then stop using him
after this exhibition is through.

424
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,050
Yeah. I don't need to use it as
bait to make him do anything anymore.

425
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,300
But I still want to see him often.

426
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,750
Theo was the
reason I can draw again.

427
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,890
He gave me passion.

428
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,450
Look at these pieces.

429
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,810
I guess you can tell.

430
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,660
I think...

431
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,280
deep down I might
have a feeling for him.

432
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,920
He's some kind of energy
that gets me to draw again.

433
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,280
By watching him practice,

434
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,750
how can I tell if
he is Enchanté or not?

435
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,340
Look there.

436
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,380
He plays football with his left foot.

437
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
He's sure a lefty.

438
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,140
You think?

439
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,800
If Natee's drawing is right,

440
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,940
that lefty guy might be Wayo.

441
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,550
Theo.

442
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,040
Thanks for coming.

443
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,150
I'll play the best I
can and score for you.

444
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,510
Wayo, are you a lefty?

445
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,980
Wayo.

446
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,960
Let's go.

447
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,800
The referee is asking for you.

448
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,830
Don't forget to root for me, Theo.

449
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,300
Can someone like
Wayo be Enchanté?

450
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,020
Hey.

451
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,670
Saifa is waving at you.

452
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
Saifa is writing with his left hand.

453
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,090
I...

454
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,770
I'm a lefty too.

455
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,650
It’s yours.

456
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,920
Why are you giving it to me?

457
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,580
I won because of you.

458
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,010
How do I know
you’re the real Enchanté?

459
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,790
I saw Wayo confessing his
feelings for you in public.

460
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,610
So I wanted to come and talk to
you about the real Enchanté.

461
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,650
You can do that to anyone.

462
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,390
But you can’t do that to Theo.

463
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
Just freakin’ get in already.

464
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,350
I know you miss France so much.

465
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,090
But I can’t take
you to Champs-Ésées.

466
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,200
Champs-Élysées.

467
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,550
Yeah, that one.

468
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,380
So I take you here instead.

469
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,230
You plant a rose?

470
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,770
It’s our important witness.

471
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,880
Witness to what?

472
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,010
Don’t you remember?

473
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,230
So it wasn’t just a dream?

474
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,860
You know it, right?

475
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,640
You know the reason
I’ve done all these things?
