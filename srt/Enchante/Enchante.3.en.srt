1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,330
My friend…

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,530
Don’t come because you’re fired.

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,330
I heard you’re fired because of me.

4
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,520
A cop called me.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,200
Do you think I’d just leave you there?

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,090
Let’s go, little bro.

7
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,370
Mr. Theo, Dr. Thamrong’s son has arrived.

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,180
This is a crosswalk. Cars must stop for people to cross.

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,920
Pedestrians should take priority here.

10
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,610
It’s a crosswalk. Please let them cross the street first.

11
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,020
That’s the chancellor’s son who just moved back from overseas.

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,110
It isn’t your job to take care of me.

13
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,530
Of course, it is.

14
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,160
You’re my peer mentee, Theo.

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,010
Can you stop tapping?

16
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,990
If you have nothing to do, write something to kill time.

17
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,680
You wrote something in a library book?

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,120
Wanna try the Landmark Grilled Pork?

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,970
Landmark Grilled Pork?

20
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,010
You must try their grilled pork. It’s the way of saying you really go here.

21
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,990
Did you steal it?

22
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,400
It’s a new one.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,160
I’ll replace the one in the library with this one.

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,700
This way, no one knows what I wrote down.

25
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,380
I think someone does.

26
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,330
Don't be bored.
You can always talk to me.

27
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,110
En-Chan-Te.

28
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,210
What is it?

29
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,850
It's pronounced enchanté.

30
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,790
And who wrote back to me?

31
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,080
Maybe someone who
messes around just like you.

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
You think?

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,360
It's written particularly in French.

34
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,230
This person must know I wrote it first.

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,090
Just put it back.

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,790
You'll be in trouble if someone
sees that you wrote in the book.

37
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,270
Hey! Why are you writing back, Theo?

38
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,410
So that we know Enchanté isn't
someone who just messes around.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,530
[Who are you?]

40
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,640
Put the new one on the shelf before
someone sees it and we get yelled at.

41
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,790
I'm not afraid of getting yelled at.

42
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,870
My curiosity already
outweighs my afraidness.

43
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's see if Enchanté is
writing me back again.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,770
Stop following me. I won't get lost.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,020
That's good then.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,540
Otherwise, you'd call me crying for help.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,280
‘Help me, please. I slept on
a bus and missed my stop again.'

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,400
‘Please help…'

49
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,380
What are you guys playing?

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,160
I've been waiting for you.

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,120
Waiting for me?

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,420
Yes.

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,420
To continue what we left off yesterday.

54
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,190
I'll head to my faculty then.

55
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,090
See you.

56
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,780
So how was yesterday?

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,420
Wow! They're all
queuing up for the grilled pork?

58
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,380
Yes.

59
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,570
Let's get in line.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,720
Actually, this shop
doesn't have a name

61
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,960
but everyone calls it
the Landmark Grilled Pork.

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,640
It's so good that
everyone wants to come.

63
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,100
Some people take it as a
place to show off themselves.

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,900
That's why they dress up. Look.

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,260
You eat grilled
pork sticks, don't you?

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,080
Of course.

67
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,500
Why?

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,700
Do I look like a picky eater?

69
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,100
No. I was just asking.

70
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,120
Some of my friends who
are so rich don't eat it.

71
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,220
I think that's too much.

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,740
Different people have different tastes.

73
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,480
100 people have 100 tastes.

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,480
It's impossible that they all think the same.

75
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,870
I don't think your friends are wrong

76
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,140
as long as they don't look
down on people lining up here.

77
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,000
If everyone thinks like you,

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
there should be
no dramas in our society.

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,680
So?

80
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,710
Is it so bad that you want to punch me?

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,700
It's all right.

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
All right?

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll take it as positive feedback.

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,340
When my brains aren't functioning,
I always eat these sticks.

85
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,260
Hey,

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,260
I see your pictures
everywhere in this university.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,260
Are you running for election or something?

88
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,360
No.

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,700
I'm a university ambassador.

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,620
That's what people call
a university representative.

91
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,080
I help out with university activities,

92
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,120
do the PR work,

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,120
and attend university events sometimes.

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,940
How do they pick an ambassador?

95
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,370
Being a scholar student,
GPA, and many other things.

96
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,340
Not just me though.

97
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,980
There are three more ambassadors.

98
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,220
It's my turn to ask questions.

99
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,060
Why did you choose Literature Major?

100
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,980
I like to read.

101
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,540
That's it?

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,300
Yes.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Why?

104
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,400
I just study what I like.
Do I need more reasons?

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,460
Do you know that Literature
Major might get phased out next year?

106
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,540
Phased out?

107
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,980
Yes.

108
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,480
Because fewer people
are joining each year.

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm not sure though.
It's just a rumor.

110
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,360
I might be wrong.

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,400
You can ask your
father if you want to know.

112
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,920
Are you canceling
the Literature Major?

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
I've been thinking about
it for a few years now.

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,020
There are fewer students joining.

115
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
It isn't worth having it.

116
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,190
Right, Theo.

117
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,160
I was going to ask you
to change your major.

118
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,290
Do you want that?
I can do it for you.

119
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,180
No, I'm not changing my major.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
I like this major.

121
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,300
If there are just a few people in
the major and I still let it run,

122
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,780
people will say I don't cancel it
because my son is in the major.

123
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,740
If you heard that, you'd be upset.

124
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,810
If Literature Major
becomes popular again,

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,740
you'll have no reason to cancel it, right?

126
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
Then…

127
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,700
I will make Literature Major great again.

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,280
What did your dad
say after you said that?

129
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,750
He said I could try.

130
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,260
He was willing to support me.

131
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,360
But…

132
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,520
If I do everything possible
and yet no students sign up,

133
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,860
it must be canceled in
accordance with university policy.

134
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,530
You're gonna have to try first, right?

135
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
I can do it.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,540
I'm sure.

137
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,200
If there is anything I can be
of service at all, just let me know.

138
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,020
I'm here to help.

139
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,460
Thank you.

140
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,340
There's one thing you
can help me with right now.

141
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,890
I'd like to know what the most
popular faculty is for this university.

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
Probably Communication Arts.

143
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,960
Why?

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
I don't want to spoil the
fun by telling you everything.

145
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,080
I'll let you know if I need
your help with anything.

146
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,060

I'll do it all ♪

166
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,640
♪ I'm still new to love ♪

167
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,270
♪ You're my tutor ♪

168
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,220
♪ Don't care how much you score

169
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,860
As long as we're together, I'll be fine ♪

170
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,950
Saifa just smiled at me.

171
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,880
I'm going to faint.

172
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,130
He's such a good ambassador.

173
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
Saifa?

174
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,740
Is he one of the ambassadors?

175
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,920
It's been a long day.

176
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,800
I spent all day thinking of the way
to attract people to join Literature.

177
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,880
Did you figure it out?

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Not yet.

179
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,780
That's a tough job.

180
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,160
Literature has never
been popular from the start.

181
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,690
A cohort is made up
of less than 10 people.

182
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,900
Because it's unpopular does
not mean it has to be phased out.

183
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
There are still people interested,
even just a few.

184
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,380
I will definitely make it popular.

185
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,000
You're so serious.

186
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,660
Your dad saw this look of yours
and still wanted to cancel it.

187
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,840
He is stone-hearted.

188
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,180
My dad is a businessman.

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
He doesn't care any look I give.

190
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,300
You're the only one who cares.

191
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,720
You gotta help me.

192
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,920
Like I have a choice.

193
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,930
You got two choices.

194
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,110
Help me willingly.

195
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
And help because I force you to.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
See?

197
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,060
You're helping, aren't you?

198
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,140
If you say so.

199
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,670
Hello, Im.

200
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,390
Hi.

201
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,010
I bought you guys dinner in
return for Khai Palo the other day.

202
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,770
How lucky we are.

203
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,630
Theo, please join us for dinner.

204
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,980
Sure.

205
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,560
Wow! Look what you're drawing here.

206
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,290
It looks so good.

207
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,930
You've got skills.

208
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,630
Not that good.

209
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,940
This is good.

210
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,670
Unlike Akk,
that guy can't draw a line.

211
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,770
Why are you talking to
her and slandering me?

212
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,770
Your drawing skills are terrible.

213
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,400
When did you ever see my drawings?

214
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Huh?

215
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
My Prince, please help. I'm scared.

216
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,730
Hang in there, Princess.

217
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,130
I'm rescuing you
from the wicked dragon.

218
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,330
Dragon, you're dead!

219
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,850
And he jumps up to the tower and slays.

220
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,910
We haven't finished the cartoon yet.

221
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm so pissed.

222
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,010
Theo.

223
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,780
Do you want to know the ending?

224
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,410
What is it that you're drawing?

225
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,250
A house lizard?

226
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,650
A dragon.

227
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,550
No. It's clearly a house lizard.

228
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,360
Why would I fight a house lizard?

229
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,090
I'm a prince. I fight a dragon.

230
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,550
Give it here.

231
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,890
This is it.

232
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,620
I'm the real prince.
I ride this unicorn to fight the dragon.

233
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,750
What about the prince in the tower?

234
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,570
That's only the prince's friend.

235
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,670
True princes don't climb up towers.

236
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,580
They ride horses like this.

237
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,830
Just play by yourself then.

238
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,750
Hey!

239
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,260
What's wrong with
being a side character?

240
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,310
He's very notable.
He appears in every scene.

241
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,050
That's right.

242
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,940
Akk drew a dragon that
looked just like a house lizard.

243
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,320
Did you sneak into
my room and read my book?

244
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,300
I didn't sneak in.

245
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,190
I was looking for some papers to draw.

246
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,430
You're the one that
told me to look upstairs.

247
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,710
That's right.

248
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,590
But the story I read,

249
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,020
it didn't end the way you just told it.

250
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,880
(Stop! Don't talk.)

251
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,470
I'll show you.

252
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,250
Egg, stop it.

253
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,150
Egg!

254
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,270
Egg!

255
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,330
Egg, stop right here.

256
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,050
Egg!

257
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,150
Egg!

258
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,430
However,
the prince on a unicorn fails.

259
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,690
He raises his sword to
the dragon's head by accident.

260
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,310
The dragon is taken
aback and cries, 'Arghh!'

261
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,230
It expels fire and
burns the unicorn's tail.

262
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,310
The unicorn is frightened and
throws the prince off its back.

263
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
But the knight catches him first

264
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,980
and uses his other hand that holds
a sword to slay the dragon to death.

265
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,370
When did you draw more?

266
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,760
It's my comicbook.

267
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,210
Why would I let you be the hero?

268
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,970
It's just a comicbook.

269
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,590
Do you need to hold a grudge?

270
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,220
Akk always used his imagination.

271
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,360
Especially after
you went to France,

272
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,100
he played by
himself all day and night.

273
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,960
Shut up, big sis.

274
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,940
He wrote novels making
himself heroes all the time

275
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,540
but he didn't tell anyone.

276
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,650
Enough.

277
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,880
I will share them with you later.

278
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,430
That's enough.

279
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,500
Or maybe I should
publish and sell them.

280
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,140
Or I should just publish
them online and make some cash.

281
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,410
Are we having dinner or not?

282
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,790
If you guys don't stop talking,
don't eat then.

283
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,510
Come.

284
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,790
Let's go.

285
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,450
Theo, I will share
them with you later.

286
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,830
Stop it already, Im.

287
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,200
You're so poppycock.

288
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,260
You just loved
writing novels so much.

289
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,530
It was a long time ago.

290
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,340
Akk, let Egg do it.
She's old enough for it.

291
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,950
You come here and help me pack.

292
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,230
I thought you'd close down your
shop after we yelled at that customer.

293
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,250
Who said that?

294
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,740
We got really nice feedback.

295
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,270
People said it was
a high-quality berate.

296
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,410
When you have time,
join me in the Live.

297
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,860
Customers want to see you.

298
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,110
Nah!

299
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,930
Help me pack right now.

300
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,890
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,020
Take care of the dishes,
my dear sis.

302
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Took you long enough to come.

303
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,040
Do it nicely.

304
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,970
Im, do you see my sketchbook?

305
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,130
Didn't Egg put it back already?

306
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,020
Yeah?

307
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,590
(Finally, the knight can rescue the prince

308
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,550
and that makes him the
next ruler of the city.)

309
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,630
(Or maybe I should publish and sell them.)

310
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,590
(Or I should just publish them
online and make some cash.)

311
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,310
That's a good idea.

312
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,270
Shit!

313
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,350
Hey, you're not ready yet?

314
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,260
Sorry. I just woke up.

315
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,750
Why got up so late?

316
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
I helped Im pack all night.

317
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,210
And my alarm didn't work.

318
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,230
You go ahead.

319
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,630
It's fine. I can wait.

320
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,050
I also have
something to discuss with you.

321
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,750
Alright then. Give me a moment.

322
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,370
What? You're done?

323
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,290
Yes. I'm ready right
after you said you'd wait.

324
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
Aren't you
going to take a shower?

325
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,890
I already did last night.
No need to do it again.

326
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,360
Let's go, boss.

327
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,790
I got a very nice idea from Im.

328
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,420
Now I know how to attract
more people to Literature Major.

329
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,480
My big sister?

330
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,350
Does she even
have good ideas at all?

331
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes.

332
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,260
Yesterday, Im talked
about handmade books.

333
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,250
So I'm thinking of holding a book fair

334
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,790
where writers can have
space to present their work.

335
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,450
Damn!

336
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,140
You even think that far?

337
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,650
Right. There are events like
this in France all the time.

338
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,590
It's held in almost every city.

339
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,950
But from what I saw on the internet, this kind
of event doesn't happen very often in Thailand.

340
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,790
So that's why French
people are so artistic.

341
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,660
Do you think it will work?

342
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,240
It probably will.

343
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,030
But isn't it too lifeless
to have just books there?

344
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,570
Take me as an example.
I only read 8 lines per year.

345
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,970
It's lifeless because of people like you.

346
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,670
I have thought about it.

347
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,100
I will set up a booth where
people can draw and tell stories.

348
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,170
Or maybe tell
stories through music.

349
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
It might persuade
more people to read.

350
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,330
That might work.

351
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,070
This is the gimmick that will draw
more attention to the Literature Major.

352
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,680
You could come up
with all that in just one day.

353
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,620
You're good.

354
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,090
It's good, right?

355
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,400
I will pass on the idea to Phupha.

356
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,150
You talk about Phupha all the time.

357
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,470
You've been here just a few days
and made friends with the uni hot guy.

358
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,280
You'll be famous just like him soon.

359
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,180
I don't give a shit about being famous.

360
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,250
Do you remember the
first day you were here?

361
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,270
Everybody stared at you.

362
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,460
I won't come to the
uni with you anymore.

363
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,630
You're complete nonsense.

364
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,570
If you don't come with me,
I will not come at all.

365
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,070
You're even more nonsense.

366
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,270
Whatever. Just say you'll
come with me every day.

367
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,150
What's up with you?

368
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,690
If you don't give me your word,
I'll just drive with my eyes closed.

369
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,490
Theo, you can't do this.
Open your eyes.

370
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,790
Fine. I lost.
I'll come with you every day.

371
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,710
I'll be like a ghost haunting you.

372
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,340
Open your eyes!

373
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,290
What a shitty driver!

374
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,700
This car has a censorship system.
It won't crash.

375
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,050
Drive safely or
I'll smash you in the face.

376
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,990
Do it and I'll smash your face too.

377
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,710
Is this the knight
who slew the dragon?

378
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,510
Why so chickened out?

379
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,040
Chickened out, huh?

380
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,870
Ew! Akk!

381
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,630
Stop it! We're gonna crash.

382
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,230
We won't because there's censorship.

383
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,120
Did you just call me a chicken?

384
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,000
It can crash
though there's censorship.

385
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,760
Don't get your hands off the wheel.

386
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,670
Zine Fair?

387
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,070
It sounds pretty good.

388
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,870
Handmade books.

389
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,750
Are you the new
student who just joined?

390
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,720
I am.

391
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,280
Besides attending
your regular classes,

392
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,670
you must join a club as well.

393
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,060
And I'm introducing
you to the Art Club.

394
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,960
Easy to join and happy to be in.

395
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,350
Sure.

396
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,930
Thank you.

397
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,410
Go get something to eat.

398
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,080
You can't eat
that paper for lunch.

399
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,710
I have no idea what to eat.

400
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,830
What are you having?

401
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,290
Stewed Pork Leg on Rice.

402
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,670
It's so good.
The pork is super savory.

403
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,550
It looks good.

404
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,950
You can have mine.
I'll go get a new one.

405
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,770
It's fine. I'm not very hungry.

406
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,730
Not hungry?

407
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,410
I want to finish my work first.

408
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,670
I don't feel complete
if I leave it undone.

409
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Where are you right now? I'll help.

410
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,110
I will sell handmade books,

411
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,010
and there will be
live music at the event.

412
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,810
Do you think I
should have portrait art too?

413
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,970
I do.

414
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,570
What else?

415
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,690
How about book repair?

416
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Not many people do that.

417
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Were you eavesdropping on us?

418
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,400
You guys were talking very loudly.

419
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,140
I wanted to join the conversation.

420
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,620
Actually,
I think all your ideas are great.

421
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,900
Your event is interesting

422
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,390
but I'm not sure
it's attractive enough.

423
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,830
It's considered new for this university
and people aren't really aware of it.

424
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,990
You got a point.

425
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,400
What should I do
to make more people come?

426
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,450
How about you do some PR work,

427
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,830
like using the ambassadors
to attract people to join the event?

428
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,050
Well, well. Someone
is talking about himself.

429
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,010
There are four ambassadors.

430
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,550
You can use all of our services.

431
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,250
You're the only one I know.

432
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,370
Can you help me?

433
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,710
Okay. I'll handle that part.

434
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,270
I have to help you anyways.

435
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,530
Thank you.

436
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,710
I'll give them a call

437
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,370
and ask them to
meet you if possible.

438
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,950
Of course.

439
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,970
You come with me.

440
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,410
I don't think he wants me to come.

441
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,150
What made you think so?

442
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,210
♪ In a quick moment when our eyes meet

443
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,010
Can we fall in love with each other? ♪

444
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:27,580
♪ In less than a minute,
how can our feelings grow bigger? ♪

445

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,340
♪ Can those things bond us faster? ♪

♪ The one we meet on a vulnerable day ♪

448
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,090
Actually, we can discuss
Zine Fair inside the university.

449
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,030
This place is just right

450
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,610
because one of the
ambassadors plays music here.

451
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,490
What about the others?

452
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,050
They should be here soon.

453
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,410
♪ You make me want to
search and look for you ♪

454

Here they come.

455
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,490
Why are we meeting here?

456
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,690
It's so far

457
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,070
and so hot.

458
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,590
One shot of that, please.

459
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,580
Okay. Now that we're all here,
I'll start our discussion.

460
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,480
This is Theo.

461
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,110
Ah! I remember.

462
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,910
The university owner's son.

463
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,990
You drove a supercar into
the university the other day.

464
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,740
You made people go nuts.

465
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,970
You're a trust fund boy after all.
You can do anything.

466
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,240
I remember you as well.

467
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,930
You stopped the car
for me to cross the street.

468
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,030
Thanks.

469
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,570
It's Theo,
a junior from my faculty.

470
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,030
He's majoring in Literature.

471
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,510
Which is about to be phased out.

472
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,370
It will never be phased out.

473
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,910
Theo is holding Zine
Fair to promote the major

474
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,570
in order to get more
people to join next year.

475
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,990
That's why I think he
should ask you three for help.

476
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,690
Theo, they are Saifa,

477
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,510
Wayo,

478
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,990
and Natee.

479
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,130
Wow! No hand gesture
when greeting his seniors.

480
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,240
How can we help you, Theo?

481
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:12,970
We expect you to join and
talk about your favorite books.

482
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,190
That sort of thing.

483
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:20,050
We think if you all attend,
it should make the event more interesting.

484
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,090
You can play music and sing.

485
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,130
And you can draw
and decorate the booth.

486
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,840
I only want to draw Theo's face.

487
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,690
Why only my face?

488
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
I like your eyes.

489
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,300
It's like they are
hiding something inside.

490
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,740
Yes.

491
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,690
So, will you help me?

492
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,190
Umm…should I?

493
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,560
And you?

494
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,240
A book fair?

495
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,460
All I do is play football.
How can I possibly help?

496
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,580
If you don't want to help, it's fine.

497
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,780
I can do it by myself.

498
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Let's do this.

499
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,370
Finish the whole
bucket and I will help.

500
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,030
What are you playing?

501
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,520
Well, your junior has no
respect and he is very tight-lipped.

502
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,300
He's so showing off here.

503
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,250
I just want to see if
he's a heavyweight too.

504
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Just ignore him, Theo.

505
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,860
Fine.

506
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,060
If you're chickened out,
you're afraid, that's fine.

507
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,490
I understand.

508
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,910
1 2 3.

509
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,410
Make me look pretty and skinny.

510
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,130
Pretty and skinny?

511
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,960
If you want pretty and skinny,
change the model. It's lots easier.

512
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
Or hire a pro
designer to retouch your photos.

513
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,840
Because it's
something I'm not capable of.

514
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,240
Nice mouth!

515
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm your big sister.

516
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,070
All right.

517
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,270
Do it nicely.

518
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,140
1 2 3.

519
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,270
1 2.

520
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,130
Theo, are you lost again?

521
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,950
Akk, you puppy dog.

522
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,470
You're a goldfish.

523
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,650
What's with you?

524
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,670
Hotness.

525
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,890
I'm super hot and super rich.

526
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,480
Why didn't you come with me?

527
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
It's so fun here.

528
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,270
Cheers!

529
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,630
Are you drunk?

530
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,890
I'm not.

531
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,710
Cheers, again.

532
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,310
Of course.

533
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,740
Where are you?

534
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,960
I am…

535
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,870
not telling you.

536
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,770
Are you all right?

537
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,310
You are…

538
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,540
Saifa.

539
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,230
My name is Saifa.

540
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,470
Saifa,

541
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,190
the most popular man in university.

542
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,810
He doesn't pick up?

543
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,870
No.

544
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,550
Hi, Ton.

545
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,030
Can I ask you something?

546
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,250
Do you have Wayo's number?

547
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,970
You drink with me.

548
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,870
Together.

549
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,010
Sure.

550
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,480
Can I ask you a favor?

551
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,290
Call Wayo for me and ask where he's at.

552
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
You do know?

553
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,670
This is so good.

554
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Let me have one more gulp.

555
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
You're intoxicated.

556
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,030
Damn it, Theo!

557
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,540
Wasted like a dog.

558
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,300
No, you are a dog.

559
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,110
And you're foul-mouthed.

560
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,090
I'm gonna hit you in the face.

561
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,030
Let's go home. I'll take you.

562
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,050
Let me drive you guys home.

563
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,890
I have a car.

564
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,870
That's fine.

565
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,880
He drove here. I'll drive his car back home.

566
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,150
Do you want to fight? Let's fight.

567
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,740
Bring it.

568
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,680
You're such a burden.

569
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,370
It's okay.

570
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,490
Let's fight first.

571
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,770
Are you alright, Theo?

572
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,520
Should I take you home?

573
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,850
No. I can drive him home.

574
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,490
Are you sure?

575
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,610
I am.

576
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,590
You stay here.

577
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,840
Bye.

578
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,270
Walk carefully.

579
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,190
Get home safe, Theo.

580
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,230
Mind your head.

581
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,930
Someone wanted
to win a heart but failed.

582
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,860
I take care of Theo as his peer mentor.

583
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,990
Yeah?

584
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,140
Thanks, Im.
I'll take it from here.

585
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:52,950
Okay.

586
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,310
If there's anything at all, give me a call.

587
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,910
Sure. Thank you.

588
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,450
Here.

589
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,170
You did that on purpose.

590
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
Just sleep, you burden.

591
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,890
You're yelling at me again.

592
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,630
I didn't ask for your help.

593
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:13,760
You're right.

594
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,060
I was being nosy.

595
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,250
You know what?

596
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,090
You are so damn nosy.

597
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,630
Super duper nosy, know that?

598
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
You dumbass.

599
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,650
Without you,
I still have Enchanté.

600
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,210
What Enchanté
are you talking about?

601
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Enchanté wrote me back.

602
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,330
[You can call me Enchanté.]

603
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,950
[Whenever you're bored, you can just talk to me.
- Enchanté]

604
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,860
What is this?

605
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,190
Are you up?

606
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,500
How come I'm in your room?

607
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,200
You were so wasted last night.

608
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,160
If I took you home,
your parents would be furious.

609
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,180
I was that bad?

610
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,920
Yeah.

611
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,120
Do you want to see proof?

612
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,800
You were so drunk and climbed
up the big speaker just to pee.

613
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,980
You asshole! Delete it.

614
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,260
Bastard! Give it to me.

615
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Give it or I'll punch you.

616
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,600
Okay.

617
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,880
I was just kidding.

618
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
No videos.

619
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,340
Alright.

620
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,720
I've never been this drunk before.

621
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,400
I was shocked there.

622
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,160
That's good.

623
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,900
A shock will cure the hungover.

624
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,700
That's hiccups.

625
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,900
[You can call me Enchanté.]

626
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,120
[Whenever you're bored, you can just talk to me. - Enchanté]

627
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,400
What are you doing?

628
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,400
Can you see that
Enchanté is writing me back?

629
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,030
It isn't someone who
messes around like you said.

630
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,830
Why Enchanté though?

631
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,830
Enchanté is a French word
that means ‘nice to meet you.'

632
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,580
I want to know who it is.

633
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,360
Why do you want to know?

634
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,420
If you ask me,
this stalker of yours is a psychopath.

635
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,020
A psychopath?

636
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,130
I don't feel that way at all.

637
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,340
I feel like this person is warm, reliable,

638
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
and very understanding.

639
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,050
Wouldn't you want to
know who this is if you were me?

640
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Nope. Not at all.

641
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,160
You're just not aesthetic at all.

642
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,520
Think about it.

643
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,110
I just got back from France.

644
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,880
I'm bored and lonely.

645
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,250
And the person with this handwriting
came in the right place at the right time.

646
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,680
I feel like I have someone
who really understands me.

647
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,900
I just want to know who this is.

648
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,760
Fine.

649
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:59,620
If you want to know that bad,
I'll help you look for that Te-Te person of yours.

650
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,270
Are you serious?

651
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,020
You're not lying, are you?

652
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm not.

653
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,630
Ask more questions
and I'll change my mind.

654
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,860
What are you going to do?

655
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,910
Enchanté, if you really are a friend,
meet me at the library right at noon.

656
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,230
We need 50 copies, please.

657
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,570
Seriously, 50?

658
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,560
Nope! Let's make it 5,000 copies.

659
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,650
Shit!

660
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,430
Are you serious?

661
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Akk, hold up.

662
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,870
Akk, stop it.

663
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Why are you doing this?

664
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,780
I said stop.

665
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
This isn't funny.

666
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,020
Akk,

667
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,890
I told you to stop.

668
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,880
What now?

669
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,630
This is too much.

670
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,430
You want to see that Te-Te person.

671
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,600
If we do this, we will get
to meet the person in no time.

672
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,920
You only need to be
there at the appointed hour.

673
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,120
If this Te-Te guy is real,
he will show up.

674
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,480
Damn you.

675
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,350
Why?

676
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,810
Are you afraid no one would show up?

677
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,520
Hey, Enchanté is just
someone who messes around.

678
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,310
Trust me.

679
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,720
Quit doing it then.

680
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,900
I must finish it.

681
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,100
Give them up, Akk.

682
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,600
No.

683
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,720
You're having too much fun.

684
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,130
I need to post it everywhere.

685
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,140
Give them to me, Akk.

686
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,350
Akk, hand them over.

687
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,190
Stop. They might slip out of hands.

688
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Give them to me.

689
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:35,777
It's me. I'm Enchanté.

690
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,260
Those four guys claim to be that Te-Te guy of yours?

691
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,570
Enchanté must be just one person.

692
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,950
Why would they lie to me?

693
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,270
They even know French.

694
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,520
I’m not pranking you.

695
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,600
I really am Enchanté.

696
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
I have an idea.

697
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,960
We must try to get their handwriting.

698
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,900
Please welcome the four
Nawawiwat University ambassadors.

699
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,270
This song is for people who are in love,

700
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,410
just like Theo.

701
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,460
Whoever knows the latest message in
the book should be the right one.

702
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,410
Wait.

703
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,820
I have something for you.

704
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,060
Who is the real one here?
