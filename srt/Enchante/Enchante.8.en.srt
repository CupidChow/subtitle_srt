1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,900
♪ Je t'aime à la lafie ♪

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,590
There's just one word
I can recognize there.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,430
Je t'aime?

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,580
Do you even realize what you're saying?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,890
Je t'aime.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,620
Make it look like a candid one.

7
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,720
And you said you didn't
like your photo taken.

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,250
I might have things I like

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
but I don't want you to know it.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,310
You know it, right?

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,820
You know the reason
I've done all these things?

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,350
He's lying to you because he wants
the bigger budget for the football club.

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,590
So he can pay for
the gambling money he lost.

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,970
Do you want to talk about that thing?

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,540
Have you found a way to deal with it?

16
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,630
You can do that to anyone.

17
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,710
But you can't do that to Theo.

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,300
Everyone wants to
be Enchanté to use you.

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,380
I don't want you to
search for Enchanté anymore.

20
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,460
This is between me and Theo.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,560
It doesn't concern you.

22
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,980
You think you have
any right to hurt me?

23
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,110
Akk, stop.

24
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,220
Don't waste your
time on someone like that.

25
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,610
Someone like me and what?

26
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,340
F*cking asshole!

27
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,730
Stop it.

28
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,190
Enough!

29
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,420
I will report this
to the chancellor myself.

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,120
You can't.

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,330
I don't want to get kicked out.

32
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,730
Theo, I'm truly sorry for the trouble.

33
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,330
What is going on here?

34
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,590
Not a good time to ask.

35
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,110
Everyone, back in the club room.

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,740
I will tell you all what happened.

37
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,300
As for you Wayo,
try pulling yourself together.

38
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,790
Act like the real team captain.

39
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,720
I'll take responsibility for this issue.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,480
Are you okay?

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
Does it hurt?

42
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,680
Nothing is broken.

43
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,380
Just bruises.

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,330
What's in there?

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,620
Ah! It's cold.

46
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,210
Here. Your cold
pack to prevent swelling.

47
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,570
Hey,

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,330
you have bruises too.

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm fine.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,790
Let me see.

51
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,980
It's a bruise.

52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,280
Hey!

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,690
It's icy.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,470
Just try to endure
so it won't get swollen.

55
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,200
Do not move.

56
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,310
Do you feel it?

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,150
It's getting warmer.

58
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,220
It isn't as cold as before.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,830
It's weird.

60
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,030
Probably a human body mechanism.

61
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,420
We transfer heat to each other.

62
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,840
Really?

63
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,550
I just made that up.

64
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,770
Damn you!

65
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,390
Well, it's a possibility.

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,090
Or else why is it getting warmer?

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,830
Put your other hand in the bucket.

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
See if it's getting warmer
too if you stay long enough.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,520
So?

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,850
I can't stand it anymore.

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,030
Maybe our hands are numb already.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,080
They are not.

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
They might be if
we go on a bit longer.

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
Hold on.

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,480
Let's make it a challenge.

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,780
Whoever gets his
hand out first loses.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,690
What will I get if I win?

78
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,320
You'll get to mock me.

79
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,790
Fine.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,790
The winner gets
to drink the whole bottle.

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,770
It's mine.

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,850
Are you afraid, little bro Theo?

83
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,910
Little bro, my ass.

84
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,480
Game on. Whoever
gets his hand out first loses.

85
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,060
Starts now.

86
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,250
If you can't bear it,
just get your hand out.

87
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,740
Sure I can.

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Can you bear it, little bro Theo?

89
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,200
It's cold, isn't it?

90
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,390
Argh!

91
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,320
You suck, little bro Theo.

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,100
I can't feel my hand anymore.

93
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,730
Doesn't your hand feel numb at all?

94
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,090
It does but I can take it.

95
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,720
Give it.

96
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,780
You said you could take it?

97
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,560
How about this?

98
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,500
They are cold.

99
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,670
Akk!

100
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Ouch! Akk, you just started it.

101
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,220
Come closer and I'll splash you.

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,620
You, asshole.

103
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,230
Here.

104
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,820
The loser could use a drink too.

105
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,280
What? It's empty.

106
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,610
You'll get to drink when you win next time.

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,760
Akk, what a jackass!

108
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,460
Akk!

109
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,970
Gotcha!

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,510
Don't.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,770
Where are you going?

112
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,910
Everyone is a member of this club and
it's my fault I hid it from you.

113
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,930
Can I be the one that tells them?

114
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,440
I forged Teacher Fon's signature and
spent the club money on football betting.

115
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,590
I honestly thought I
could return the money in time

116
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,070
before anyone found out.

117
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,480
That's good.

118
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,670
That's it.

119
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,120
Crap!

120
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,250
Good morning, Mr. Theo.

121
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,770
Dr. Thamrong's son has arrived.

122
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,430
There will be security guards
informing your way to the parking spot.

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,650
So I approached Theo and told him

124
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,240
I was Enchanté he was looking for.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,860
I was scamming him into
talking to the chancellor in order
to get extra funds for the club.

126
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,440
Then I'd pay back the money I
took with the additional amount.

127
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,540
But I was caught first.

128
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,050
The chancellor should
hear this news very soon.

129
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,990
I don't think I'm fit
to be your captain anymore.

130
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,840
We can help you raise the money.

131
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,500
I wanted you all to know the
truth because you're the club committees.

132
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,710
You might get investigated too.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,520
I will take responsibility.

134
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,460
Teacher Fon,

135
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,310
thank you for giving me a chance to fix it,

136
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,790
for giving me time to return the money,

137
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,380
and for not taking
it to the management board.

138
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,740
But I can't drag you into this mess.

139
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,050
I will confess to them

140
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,450
and be solely responsible for my actions.

141
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,310
What are you going to do with Wayo?

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,620
I might just let them deal with their
own problem, as Teacher Fon asked.

143
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,020
Akk.

144
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,830
Thank you for being angry for
me when I got fooled by Wayo.

145
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,860
I have disliked him for so long myself.

146
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,470
Can I ask you a question?

147
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,640
Why were you so mad when he lied to me?

148
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Why do you want to protect me?

149
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,790
It's yours.

150
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,900
I'll check it later.

151
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,200
It's nothing.

152
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,130
Saifa sent you a voice message.

153
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,450
It might be something urgent.

154
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,680
He's just updating me
on the song he's been writing.

155
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,580
Do you still think he's Enchanté?

156
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,460
I don't know.

157
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,720
He's the only choice left.

158
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,810
Answer his message.

159
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,780
It might be important.

160
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,040
It's good to be a rose.

161
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,330
People see you
and know what you mean.

162
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,020
You don't need to say anything.

163
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
You always told me
everything when we were kids.

164
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,800
Why isn't it the same now?

165
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,210
I'm waiting for you to say it.

166
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,700
You, fox.

167
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,500
I listened to the song you sent me.

168
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,360
Je t'aime à la folie?

169
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,310
What do you think?

170
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,520
I just want to cry.

171
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Because it's very touching?

172
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,450
I don't know what it means.

173
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,440
Why don't you figure it out this time?

174
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,050
You, fox.

175
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
[I'm madly in love with you.]

176
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,030
Cut!

177
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,720
Akk, what are you
doing there with your friend?

178
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,130
We're filming a short film here.

179
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,390
I didn't know that. I'm sorry, senior.

180
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,200
Now what? Will you be my actors?

181
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,710
You two look good on screen.

182
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,700
That's okay.

183
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,120
I don't know how to act.

184
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Let me know if you change your mind.

185
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,730
Damn! Almost got to be a hero.

186
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,920
What hero?

187
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,710
I don't want to be an actor.

188
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,690
Excuse me, sir. I meant me.

189
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,560
At that moment…

190
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,180
What?

191
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,010
You kissed me.

192
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,370
What kiss?

193
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,120
Your face and your
mouth touched me right here.

194
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,220
I wouldn't call that a kiss.

195
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,080
A kiss should be like this.

196
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,960
What's up with you?

197
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,100
You kissed me twice already today.

198
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,510
I told you we
shouldn't count the first one.

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,990
When we kiss,
we must put a feeling into it.

200
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,210
What feeling?

201
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,420
Like this.

202
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,970
So?

203
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,260
Do you feel it?

204
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,700
I don't.

205
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,540
My turn.

206
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,320
How was that?

207
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,520
Nothing at all.

208
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,350
Watch. It must be like this.

209
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,030
So?

210
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,040
Why don't you
just eat my head already?

211
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,770
I feel nothing.

212
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,980
Here.

213
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,000
Do you feel it now?

214
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,610
I do.

215
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,880
I feel like you're a dog.

216
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,240
Damn you!

217
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,570
I'm tired over here.

218
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,930
How about this?

219
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,150
This.

220
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,330
Do you feel it?

221
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,290
What do I need to feel?

222
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,200
I should just go.

223
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,270
You're such a loony.

224
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,720
You sure feel it.

225
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,450
You asked him to meet you here?

226
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,070
No.

227
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,260
Was there a problem
at the football club yesterday?

228
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,750
It's nothing.

229
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,330
Are you all right?

230
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,980
I am.

231
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,960
That's good.

232
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,510
I was worried.

233
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,570
I was afriad Wayo would hurt you.

234
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm fine.

235
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,600
I should get to class now.

236
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,760
Wait up.

237
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,030
The song I sent you yesterday,

238
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,210
I wrote it just for you.

239
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,000
Do you like it, Theo?

240
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
It's good.

241
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,850
Good?

242
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,140
And do you like it?

243
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,030
Are you trying to trick him too?

244
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,030
Why would I do that?

245
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,240
Everyone approaches him
because they want something from him.

246
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,710
I don't know about those people.

247
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,520
But I never lie to Theo.

248
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,050
If you're free tonight,

249
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,380
come see me play.

250
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,960
I want to spend time with you.

251
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,180
I have so many things to say to you.

252
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,820
Theo has class.

253
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,150
He's late.

254
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,470
I thought we'd go to class.

255
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,410
I told you to stop
searching for that Te-Te guy.

256
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,200
You might get fooled again.

257
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,960
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

258
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,840
He came to see me himself.

259
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,340
You can tell him you no longer care.

260
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,820
It doesn't matter
if he's Te-Te or not.

261
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
What if he really is?

262
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,640
Then I'll miss my last chance.

263
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,440
You seem to care
about this Te-Te guy so much.

264
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,380
All I can do is warn you.

265
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,210
If you don't listen then it's your call.

266
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,590
Akk.

267
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,650
I really want to apologize.

268
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,640
I admit I wasn't thinking it through.

269
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,680
But I didn't mean
to deceive you and Theo.

270
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,540
Save it.

271
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,770
I can't.

272
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,230
I don't want to see you like this.

273
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,880
I'll get over it.

274
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,170
I can't stay mad at you for long.

275
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,640
At first,

276
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,090
I didn't get it at all

277
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,230
why you were always by Theo's side.

278
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
And I didn't care if
Wayo was going to use him.

279
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,110
Because Theo is never my friend.

280
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,290
But you know what?

281
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,130
There's someone

282
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,070
who feels more than just friends.

283
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,340
How did it go?

284
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,050
I was discharged from
my position as team caption

285
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,860
and academically suspended.

286
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,530
After the suspension,
you can still come back to study.

287
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,730
Yes.

288
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,970
But I told them
you had nothing to do with it.

289
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,070
I'll leave that to the board to decide.

290
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,310
I can take responsibility for my own actions.

291
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,390
Thank you for giving me the chance, Teacher.

292
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,050
You know why I helped you.

293
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,430
From now on,

294
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,970
don't allow your
feelings to influence your decisions.

295
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,010
I don't want you to get
into this kind of difficulty again.

296
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,310
I will try.

297
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,670
It's just me who feels it or you do too, Theo?

298
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,000
[It's freakin' boring!]
[Don't be bored.
You can always talk to me. - Enchanté]

299
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,960
[Who are you?]
[You can call me Enchanté. Whenever you're
bored, you can just talk to me. - Enchanté]

300
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,410
[There are 4 Enchantés. Who exactly are you?]
[Who do you want me to be?
I can be anything for you. - Enchanté]

301
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,880
[Who are you?]
[You can call me Enchanté. Whenever you're
bored, you can just talk to me. - Enchanté]

302
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,260
[Everyone wants to be…Enchanté.]

303
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,100
This is useless.

304
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,330
[I just don't know
what I should do anymore.]

305
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,330
You don't need to do anything.

306
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,340
Can I…

307
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,720
be your Enchanté?

308
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,610
What do you mean

309
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,470
by saying that?

310
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,450
Theo.

311
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,620
Hold on.

312
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,590
Wait.

313
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,680
Is there anything
you want to say to me?

314
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,940
What do you want me to say?

315
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,620
Why did you just do that?

316
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,330
I…

317
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,590
I didn't mean to do it.

318
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,650
I'm sorry.

319
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,490
You didn't mean to?

320
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
Don't you ever get close to me again.

321
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,080
Why did you just do that?

322
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,850
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,170
I didn't mean to do it.

324
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,380
Don't you ever get close to me again.

325
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,540
Crap!

326
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,460
Why did I do that to Theo?

327
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,240
Here.

328
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,750
Why are you giving it to me?

329
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,520
Just take it.

330
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,070
I don't think I need it anymore.

331
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,310
But you might need
it to see who Enchanté is.

332
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,400
Enchanté?

333
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,700
Umm.

334
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,270
So you do know who Enchanté is?

335
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,900
I do.

336
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,760
I have always known.

337
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
If you do,

338
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,450
just say it.

339
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,060
Open it.

340
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,450
Your Gin & Tonic is served.

341
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,110
Thank you.

342
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,470
What's bothering you?

343
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,990
Nothing.

344
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,950
I can tell from the way you
look that something's wrong.

345
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Should Enchanté help
to make you feel better?

346
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,250
I don't want to talk about Enchanté.

347
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,150
I know things don't
always go as you plan, Theo.

348
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,360
I can help you.

349
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,120

00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,640

Thank you.

365
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,770
Want something stronger?

366
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,490
It's strong enough.

367
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,740
You mean the drink or something else?

368
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,650
Sometimes I just don't get myself.

369
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,650
Why do I need to do all this?

370
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,260
I'm exhausted.

371
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,150
The Enchanté search journey is…

372
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,520
so damn pointless.

373
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,140
Theo,

374
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,640
listen to me.

375
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,810
What are you doing?

376
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,010
What do you think I'm doing?

377
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,810
Do you think I
don't know what you hope for?

378
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,700
Are you okay?

379
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,960
Why are you here?

380
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,330
I have something to say to you.

381
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,240
I don't.

382
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,400
But we must talk.

383
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,460
Stop messing with me.

384
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,790
Come here.

385
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,040
Here.

386
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,320
Akk.

387
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,300
We need to talk.

388
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,600
Why are you doing this?

389
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,460
Saifa, aren't you going to follow them?

390
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,880
I don't think I need to.

391
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,240
Be careful.

392
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm not drunk.

393
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,350
Are you sure about that?

394
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Didn't you realize what
Saifa was about to do to you?

395
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,280
We were just talking.

396
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,880
Why did you drag me up here?

397
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,480
Why are you doing this, Akk?

398
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
I don't want you to
look for Enchanté anymore.

399
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,150
So what if I keep looking for him?

400
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,810
You think you have any right to stop me?

401
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,810
I do.

402
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,560
Because I'm...

403
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,530
...your Enchanté.

404
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,930
You're not Enchanté.

405
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,650
I was in the library all day that day.

406
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,530
I was there until the evening.

407
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,080
Then I saw a guy walking into
the library looking for a book.

408
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,590
He picked up this book and
wrote something in it with his right hand.

409
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,970
When he's done,

410
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,400
he switched to his left
hand and wrote something too.

411
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,210
I saw him finishing the
conversation with my own eyes.

412
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,570
Can you guess who I'm talking about?

413
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,820
The one I'm talking about is
the one you guys are looking for.

414
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,300
He's Enchanté.

415
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,630
Listen carefully.

416
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,020
The Enchanté you're
looking for is your friend Theo.

417
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,590
Aren't you mad at me now that you know?

418
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,530
Actually, I have figured it out for a while.

419
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,280
I was just confused.

420
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,890
I didn't know why you did it.

421
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,070
Do you want to know why I did it?

422
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,900
I just wanted your attention.

423
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,310
You're the only one I know.

424
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,830
Can you help me?

425
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,770
I'll give them a call and
ask them to meet you if possible.

426
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,670
You come with me.

427
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,540
I don't think he wants me to come.

428
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,730
What made you think so?

429
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,000
If you're too lazy to come, just say it.

430
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,510
Yes, I am.

431
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,450
You're leaving me again.

432
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,590
You should learn to go places yourself.

433
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,130
I'm not goldfish poop. I don't need
to stick with your ass everywhere.

434
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,560
Are you all right?

435
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,690
Saifa,

436
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,920
the most popular man in university.

437
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,250
Why are you looking at me with a smile?

438
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,910
You want to be a singer, don't you?

439
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:32,650
It's normal for people who
love singing to want to be singers.

440
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,360
I…

441
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
can make you a singer.

442
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,440
What do you mean?

443
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,980
You're a talented man.

444
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,950
You just need an opportunity.

445
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,290
I can be your opportunity.

446
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,730
Are you serious?

447
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,030
But we need to make a deal.

448
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,890
What deal?

449
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,270
You must be my Enchanté.

450
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,880
Sorry, Akk.

451
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,890
Sorry, I lied to you.

452
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,050
I did it partly
because I was angry with you.

453
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
That's why I asked
Saifa to be my Enchanté.

454
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,170
But you screwed it all.

455
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,590
I did?

456
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,390
You put up the leaflets
everywhere in the university.

457
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,730
Then four people showed up.

458
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,110
I thought I'd let it go

459
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,710
but you said you would help me.

460
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,430
Like you didn't care for me at all.

461
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,430
I didn't care for you?

462
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,120
I have always cared for you.

463
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,050
So I thought I'd do
anything you wanted for you.

464
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,930
Yell at me, Akk.

465
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,730
Scold me.

466
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,250
Whatever you want
to say to my face, just do it.

467
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,970
I was stupid to do such a stupid thing.

468
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,330
I wanted to drop it

469
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,490
but once I started and couldn't stop myself.

470
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,320
The more I did, the more I
wanted to know how you felt about me.

471
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,480
Do you know now how I feel about you?

472
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,120
I like you, Theo.

473
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,720
I've liked you for so long.

474
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,650
But I didn't want to wishfully think
someone like you would like me too.

475
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,310
You know what?

476
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,550
I've been waiting to hear that from you.

477
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,330
I've always liked you.

478
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,090
I've never stopped liking you.

479
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,060
Sorry I kept you waiting.

480
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,390
You know?

481
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,460
You're the one I've
always had feelings for too.

482
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,350
Don't you go far away from me again.

483
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,100
So…

484
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,960
Can I kiss you?

485
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,900
Kiss you as your Enchanté.

486
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,150
Kiss you as someone who likes you.

487
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,980
Kiss you…

488
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,730
Be my boyfriend?

489
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,190
I'm tired already.

490
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,770
You don't seem to be
interested in any games I propose.

491
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,040
I don't know what game to play.

492
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,330
Your watch is poking my back.

493
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,200
How did you know it's a watch?

494
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,540
Because I'm so damn smart.

495
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,820
Akk,

496
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,730
I know what to play.

497
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,010
What?

498
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,940
What did I just use to poke you?

499
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,300
A finger.

500
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,730
That's too broad.

501
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,870
Your right ring finger. Happy now?

502
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,800
Hey!

503
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,660
How did you get it right?

504
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,210
This?

505
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,880
Your elbow.

506
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,320
Your cheek.

507
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,940
What? That was too fast.

508
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,550
Turn around.

509
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,120
I'll do it like you just did to me.

510
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,830
What did you..?

511
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,290
Thanks to you, Theo, for giving me
a chance to follow my dreams.

512
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,390
I give it to you because
it was our witness.

513
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,210
That night in
the exhibition room,

514
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,280
it wasn’t a dream.

515
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,490
What’s going
on between you two?

516
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,250
I prefer this.

517
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,740
This love is so damn good.
