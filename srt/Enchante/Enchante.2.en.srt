1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,210
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,000
It is my house.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,610
Are you Theo?

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,010
Akk.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,620
If you don’t mind, you're welcome to stay here.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,990
Don’t want to bother you.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,660
You still have that?

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,210
I’m loyal.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,200
Do you want to see the university?

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,650
You can go to work.

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,590
I will go later with Akk.

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,910
You should go inside.

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,970
Why did you come then?

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,330
To keep you company.

15
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,730
I was afraid you’d get lost.

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,290
Why isn’t he home yet?

17
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,590
I’m calling from a police station.

18
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,200
It’s about Mr. Theo.

19
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,150
Theo.

20
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,810
How are you?

21
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,510
Are you hurt?

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,040
I will be because of you.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,600
You're squeezing my arm.

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,010
Let go.

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,530
Damn you!

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
Sir, what did he do?

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,440
I didn't do anything.

28
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,630
Should I call staff and tell
him to enroll in classes for you?

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,030
That's okay.

30
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,740
I should do it myself.

31
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,850
Young man, we're
reaching the last stop.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,930
You're sitting here in a police
station because you slept on a bus,

33
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,490
missed your stop,

34
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,170
and got lost?

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,450
Yes.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,900
You know what?

37
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,220
When the lieutenant called…

38
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,970
I'm a sergeant.

39
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,530
Right!

40
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,970
When the sergeant called,

41
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,400
I was losing it when he said
he had information on you.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,790
I thought you got into an accident or a fight.

43
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,360
Wow! You just missed your stop.

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,390
If I had known you'd go off like
this, I wouldn't have called you.

45
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,050
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,700
I was just being foul-mouthed.

47
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,150
I didn't mean to.

48
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,010
Are we all good?

49
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,850
Let's go home.
Why are you still sitting here?

50
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,930
Come on.

51
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,570
Thank you, Lieutenant.

52
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm a sergeant.

53
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,890
Which stop did you
get off to end up here?

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,760
Around there, near the electricity post.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,740
I walked on and ended up here.

56
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,460
That's pretty far.

57
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,750
Not that far.

58
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,550
When I was in Paris,
I always walked to places.

59
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,890
My phone died.

60
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,130
Luckily, I found a police station

61
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,450
so I asked him to
call your home phone.

62
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,410
Why did you call
me and not your father?

63
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,850
I don't want him to be worried.

64
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,160
Why? Can't I call you?

65
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,410
You can.

66
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,150
I'm just curious how you
know my home phone number.

67
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,610
Of course, I know.

68
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,450
Have you read the
latest Detective Conan?

69
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,330
I haven't.

70
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,930
It's awesome.

71
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,150
That's right.

72
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,970
You used to call and disturb me
every day when we were kids.

73
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,940
I forgot.

74
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,250
You always forget.

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,560
By the way, are you hungry?

76
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,330
I'm starving.
Thought you wouldn't ask.

77
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,010
Come on then.
I'll take you to eat something yummy.

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,770
What is it?

79
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,830
Trust me.
This diner is amazing.

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,150
What if it's not?

81
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
It is.

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,790
What is it?

83
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,680
What does it mean?

84
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,910
Does it mean delicious, Theo?

85
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,270
That's right.

86
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,490
I thought I wouldn't
get to taste this savor again.

87
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,970
Whenever you want to
eat this, just let me know.

88
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,380
I made a lot.

89
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,890
Eat as much as you want.

90
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,040
Akk convinced me to cook this menu.

91
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,240
Don't thank me. I wanted to eat it.

92
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,670
You're just lucky.

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,050
Thank you so much, Im.

94
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,250
It's so good.

95
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,050
We have a lot left.
Do you want to take some home?

96
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,870
That's okay.

97
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,980
Thanks.

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Let's clean up.

99
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,420
Let me help.

100
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Your phone is vibrating.

101
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,990
Yes, Por.

102
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,030
Where the heck are you, Akk?

103
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,430
You said you would come.

104
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,340
Hear me out.

105
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,190
My friend was…

106
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,190
What now?

107
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,110
Did your friend die?
My shop is dying.

108
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,490
I'm hiring you, Akk.
I'm not asking for help.

109
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,230
Come on…

110
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,910
Go help your friend then.

111
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,050
Don't come because you're fired.

112
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,730
What is it?

113
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,550
Por asked me to take
tonight's shift and I forgot.

114
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,290
Right!

115
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,830
That's why he was so loud.

116
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,390
He's having a fight with his wife
and got so mad that he fired me.

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Fired?

118
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,110
I wanted to quit too

119
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,630
so I can have time to take
photos and sell them online.

120
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,870
Are you okay?

121
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
I'm fine.

122
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,790
I have many jobs to do.

123
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,310
And right now I
have to wash the dishes.

124
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,570
It's all good.

125
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,890
It's fine. I can do it.

126
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,630
I'm not here to help.

127
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,070
I want to talk to you.

128
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,780
I heard you're fired because of me.

129
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,380
Not because of you.

130
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,440
He's just being unreasonable.

131
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,710
Next time if you're busy, just tell me.

132
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,030
A cop called me.

133
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,030
Do you think I'd
just leave you there?

134
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,950
I could find my way home eventually.

135
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,950
I could live in
France by myself just fine.

136
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,170
Yeah, you smartass!

137
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,270
Come on. I am okay.

138
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,070
I always wanted to quit.

139
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,730
I was often ill-treated by the shop owner.

140
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,710
No one in their right mind fires an employee
because he has a fight with his wife.

141
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,990
Right?

142
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,270
If you didn't ditch work,
he wouldn't be mad.

143
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,430
What do you want then?

144
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,270
Do you want me to say
you're the reason I got fired?

145
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,090
Now you have to take care of
me for the rest of your life.

146
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,970
You want that?

147
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,650
Can you handle that?

148
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,750
See?

149
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,790
Stunned?

150
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,150
Speechless, huh?

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,980
Come on. I told you I am fine.

152
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,060
I want to have more time to
improve my photographing skills.

153
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,310
In the shop,
all I did was take ID photos.

154
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,530
The longer I was there,
the worse my skills got.

155
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,350
Fine.

156
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,460
Okay.

157
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,820
I'll go home then.

158
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,230
Aren't you gonna
help now that you're here?

159
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,690
You said you could do it yourself.

160
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,150
I was kidding.

161
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,770
Can you please help
me store the plates, sir?

162
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,410
Why so tight-lipped?

163
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,560
If you want me to help, just say it.

164
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,550
Thank you so much.

165
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,750
You're so hot and kind.

166
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,070
You're cute, very cute.

167
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,280
Do you remember
that Jackie Chan movie?

168
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,050
I'm gonna do the same to you.

169
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,850
Bring it on. I'm not scared.

170
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,970
I really want to smack your head.

171
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,690
We're done.

172
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,990
I should go home.

173
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,130
Wait up.

174
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,810
Drink this first.

175
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,150
Drink what now? I'm so stuffed already.

176
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,690
I stole it from Im for you.

177
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,890
It's not a sedative or anything.

179
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,450
Here.

180
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,660
Drink up.

181
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,050
You just ate five eggs in Khai Palo.

182
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,230
You're exaggerating.

183
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,230
I had two eggs.

184
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,570
Or maybe three.

185
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,450
But I had only half of it.

186
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,940
Drink it.

187
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I care about you.

188
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,790
What's up with you?

189
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Thanks anyway.

190
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,110
Don't you feel drowsy at all?

191
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,820
You invest so much
in your sleeping pill joke.

192
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,950
Why? Do you want me to
spend one more night with you?

193
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,930
What?

194
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,550
I won't let you stay.

195
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,330
Manchester United is playing tonight.

196
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,690
I can't let you crash
because you bring bad luck.

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,490
Whatever.

198
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,790
I'll go home then.

199
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,990
Don't you
feel lonely sleeping alone?

200
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,750
Lonely, my foot!

201
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,770
Thanks for walking me out.

202
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,200
I'm just here to
secure the fence gate.

203
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,090
I'm not walking you out.

204
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,480
What a jerk.

205
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,030
Thanks for telling Im
to make Khai Palo for me.

206
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,400
I wanted to eat it.

207
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,020
Why would my sister cook it for you?

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,840
Teur, my ass!

209
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,040
Did you just curse at me?

210
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,940
No.

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,060
Find the meaning yourself.

212
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,300
You just did.

213
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,340
I can smell Khai Palo.

214
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,170
Go home.

215
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,120
Bye then.

216
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,470
Get home safe.

217
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,390
Mon?

218
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,430
Men-Te?

219
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,230
Mon?

220
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,070
(Menteur.)

221
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,620
(Te, my ass!!)

222
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,670
Mente?

223
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Information not found.

224
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,450
Moncher.

225
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,690
I don't understand.

226
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,230
Menter!

227
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,860
I don't get it.

228
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Mon-Cher.

229
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Please try again.

230
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
Menter!

231
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,360
Information not found.

232
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,980
Menter!

233
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,980
Theo.

234
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,820
Are you still up?

235
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,560
I can't sleep well.

236
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,460
So I workout to get sweaty.

237
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,950
I have something for you.

238
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,470
Yes?

239
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,340
A gift for your new semester.

240
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,090
Thank you.

241
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,630
So you don't get lost
on the way home again.

242
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,740
Did Akk say something to you?

243
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,450
So Akk was the
one that took you home?

244
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,420
Akk didn't tell us.

245
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,500
The police colonel at the station
recognized you share my last name.

246
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,460
So he called.

247
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
You're very well-connected.

248
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,280
I already checked.

249
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,480
We can just transfer your credits here.

250
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,840
No problem.

251
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,150
Tomorrow we will go to
the university to meet Sureechai.

252
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,640
She will take
care of your enrollment.

253
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,940
I should do it myself.

254
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,940
But it requires lots of paperwork.

255
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,790
I will handle it.
You don't need to go through that.

256
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,600
Your dad is right.

257
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,960
Let me do it myself.

258
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,170
I don't want to bother anyone.

259
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,620
Entering mid-semester already
seems like using the connection.

260
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,300
There is no connection.

261
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,300
We will go through
the normal procedures.

262
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,220
But…

263
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
it's your call.

264
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,060
I'll let you decide.

265
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,850
Don't go to bed so late.
You might get sick.

266
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,460
Okay?

267
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,400
Sure.

268
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,530
Damn!!!

269
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,980
Oh my god!

270
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Let's go, little bro.

271
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,860
Little bro, my ass!

272
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Let's go, little bro my ass.

273
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,390
Jackass!

274
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,460
Don't call me little bro.

275
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,000
Sugar daddy Theo then.

276
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,560
Big bro Theo.

277
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
What else should I call you then?

278
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,000
(Asshole.)

279
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,860
You're an a-hole!

280
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,360
You don't seem like a
person who uses swear words.

281
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,350
I can be ruder than you think.

282
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,440
I think we should go.

283
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,360
You know, Bangkok is one of the
world's most congested traffic cities.

284
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,330
Go!

285
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,700
Alright?

286
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,600
Yep!

287
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,300
Leggo!

288
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's go.

289
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,740
Yes.

290
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
Hello, Mr. Theo.

291
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Dr. Thamrong's son has arrived.

292
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,020
There will be security guards
informing your way to the parking spot.

293
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,160
The parking spot is
reserved for you in advance.

294
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,420
I can find my own spot.

295
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,500
Just go with the flow for now.

296
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,650
It's a waste of time.

297
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,860
I don't like this at all.

298
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,180
Just go.

299
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,220
Students, please hold.

300
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,530
Pedestrians should take priority here.

301
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
It's the law.

302
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
This is a crosswalk.
Cars must stop for people to cross.

303
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,800
Please go ahead.

304
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,210
It's a crosswalk.
Please let them cross the street first.

305
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,890
Students, walk faster, please.

306
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,740
Please hurry up.

307
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,120
Don't the guards
realize it's a crosswalk?

308
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,100
Why did they do that?

309
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,140
Please.

310
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,220
Thank you.

311
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Good morning, Mr. Theo.

312
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,740
I know you hate it when
people call you Mr. Theo.

313
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,920
I will tell them
that you're just Theo.

314
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,330
I think the whole
university knows you.

315
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,080
I should go to class now

316
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,240
since a famous guy
here is stealing all my thunder.

317
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
I'm not.

318
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,660
And I don't want to be famous.

319
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,530
You can take care of
your enrollment, right?

320
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,100
Of course.

321
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,060
You should get to class.

322
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,500
See you in the evening.

323
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
This place is huge.

324
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,410
Can I have the ball back?

325
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
The ball, can I have it back?

326
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,660
Are you picking a fight with me?

327
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,330
Sorry. I kicked it too hard.

328
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,500
Hey.

329
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,640
That's the chancellor's son who
just moved back from overseas.

330
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,850
Are you Theo?

331
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,590
How did you know me?

332
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,550
Drink first.

333
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,220
We're going to
have a long conversation.

334
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,760
Thank you.

335
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,270
Welcome.

336
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,150
Thank you.

337
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,370
Sign this.

338
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
I don't think we know each other.

339
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,260
How did you know I'm
here for class enrollment?

340
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,360
No one comes here unless
they want to enroll in classes.

341
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,590
My name is Phupha,
the Faculty of Liberal Arts.

342
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,460
That's the university's main building.

343
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,260
That is the way to the
Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

344
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,120
If you want some stationery,
come here. The shop is bigger.

345
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,430
I need to buy textbooks
from the co-op anyways.

346
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,850
Why can't I just make one stop?

347
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,090
Let's go check out both places.
I'll show you the way.

348
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,680
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,940
I didn't see you.

351
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,910
It's fine.

352
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,390
Let me pay for you.

353
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,960
Sure.

354
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,830
Tan.

355
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,200
Can I get your number?

356
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,580
I might reach out
about academic stuff.

357
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,070
Who are you?

358
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,190
Did my dad send you?

359
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,110
Why do I need to be sent by anyone?

360
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,860
Because it isn't your
job to take care of me.

361
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,880
Of course, it is.

362
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,240
You're my peer mentee, Theo.

363
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,680
Peer mentee?

364
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,340
I'm from Liberal Arts.

365
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,400
If you join the faculty,
you'll be the last student in your year.

366
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,180
Just like me.

367
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,490
So, we're a peer
mentor and a peer mentee.

368
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,430
You don't seem to get what I said.

369
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,000
Enlighten me.

370
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,020
The first two digits of your
student code tell the year you enter,

371
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,790
followed by the faculty number

372
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,190
and then your individual number.

373
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,130
We share the same student code,
except the year we enter.

374
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,830
Ah! Okay.

375
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,950
So many things to
remember at Thai uni.

376
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,560
You lived in France for a long time.

377
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,280
Just learn little by little.

378
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,520
You should also learn Thai.

379
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,490
I saw how long you took to
finish the enrollment papers.

380
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,410
Yes.

381
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,020
I don't get to write
Thai that often.

382
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,580
You should try to read and
write Thai more frequently.

383
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,390
It might be a diary or something
that expresses your feelings.

384
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,500
You'll be fluent in no time.

385
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,620
You're in Thailand after all.

386
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,390
How did you know
I moved from France?

387
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,990
I know everything about you.

388
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,220
I should get going.
I have a study group.

389
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,970
See you.

390
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,140
Sure.

391
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,790
How did he know?

392
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,740
Nice and cold in here.

393
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,560
[Waiting for you in a library.]

394
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,440
[Let me know when you're done.]

395
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,800
[So we can go home together.]

396
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,700
[OK.]

397
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
Akk, you're
gonna ruin the photos.

398
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,510
Shit!

399
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,580
Do I need to start over?

400
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
[OK.]

401
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,310
What should I do?

402
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,320
Hi. I am a fox.

403
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,920
You're not from
around here, are you?

404
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm from a faraway planet.

405
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,030
Why are you crying?

406
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,450
I thought my rose was
the only rose out there.

407
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,430
But there are thousands
of roses in this world.

408
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,880
I thought I was special.

409
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,380
How about we become friends?

410
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,760
Friends?

411
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,650
Yes. But before that,
we both need to be tamed first.

412
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,880
If you promise
come at four in the afternoon,

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,160
I'll begin to be happy by three.

414
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,480
My face will be full of happiness.

415
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,060
[Are you done? I'm still in the library.]

416

Why doesn't he read my message?

417
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,570
Can you stop tapping?

418
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,160
You're distracting people.

419
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:55,970
I am sorry.

420
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,710
If you have nothing to do,
write something to kill time.

421
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,690
Does he have to be that grumpy?

422
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,630
You should try to read
and write Thai more frequently.

423

You've got tips.

book just to express my rage for you.

You wrote
something in a library book?

Hush! Keep your voice down!

I'll say you're the reason.

Why me? Are you out of your mind?

480

If you came sooner, I wouldn't have
to get bored and write anything down.

Whatever. You're late.

My friend is a little deaf.

489
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,230
He has lots of earwax
so I need to speak loudly.

490
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,750
You're the one with earwax!

491

Sorry.

492
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,210

leave before we get killed.

493
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,270
Let's go.

494
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,250

We'll stop talking now.

496

How did you know I was here?

501
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,220
I took a guess.

502
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,780
Didn't think I was right though.

503
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,050
I advised that you write.

504
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,880
I guess you did it already.

505
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,740
Something like that.

506
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Wanna try the Landmark Grilled Pork?

507
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,030
What is the Landmark Grilled Pork?

508
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,270
You must try their grilled pork.
It's the way of saying you really go here.

509
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,690
You can go with him.

510
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,430
I have to work.

511
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,170
I haven't been
out taking photos for a while.

512
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,920
Please take care of my friend.

513
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,650
See you.

514
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,780
Get home safe.

515
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,890
Should we go?

516
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,070
They're sold out very quickly.

517
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,570
I'm not really hungry.

518
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,210
I helped you with the enrollment.

519
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,150
How about you
do something in return?

520
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,510
Fine.

521
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,770
It's my treat and we call it even.

522
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,690
Sure.

523
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,020
Let's go.

524
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,510
Are you tired today?

525
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,450
A little.

526
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,040
Do you like grilled pork sticks?

527
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,250
I do.

528
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
But I don't have it very often.

529
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,850
I'll take you to a special place.

530
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,590
I'm coming. Stop honking already.

531
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,010
Did you honk for your dad to hear?

532
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,020
Yes, to tell him you're super slow.

533
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,260
Akk, be nice to my car.

534
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,690
You're in a rush, aren't you?

535
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,790
Let's go then.

536
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,730
It's the book you wrote in a library.

537
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,210
Did you steal it?

538
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,540
No. It's a new one.

539
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,280
I'll replace the one
in the library with this one.

540
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,990
See? You're getting scared,
aren't you?

541
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,570
Now you can't
report me to anyone.

542
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,310
Yes, sir.

543
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,290
I won't report you.

544
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,010
You did great, little bro Theo.

545
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,010
Little bro, huh?

546
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,150
Don't call me that again.

547
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,960
Sorry, big bro Theo.

548
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,810
Why are you honking?

549
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,850
So you can stop hitting me.

550
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,260
Sit still and quit calling me little bro.

551
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,990
Okay?

552
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,390
Yes.

553
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,570
Akk has acknowledged that, sir!

554
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,580
We'll go now.

555
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,370
You've been
going around in circles.

556
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,060
Do you really
remember where you put it?

557
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,750
Of course, I do.

558
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,510
Yes.

559
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,200
Right there.

560
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,490
Here.

561
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,090
I replaced it.

562
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,440
Right. I saw what you just did.

563
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,630
Done!

564
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,110
This way,
no one knows what I wrote down.

565
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,090
I think someone does.

566
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,840
What?

567
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,750
[Don't be bored. You can always talk to me.
- Enchanté]

568
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,110
Why are you writing back, Theo?

569
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,280
So that we know Enchanté isn’t
someone who just messes around.

570
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,810
This is Theo, a junior from my faculty.

571
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,170
He’s majoring in Literature.

572
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,250
Which is about to get phased out.

573
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,590
It will never be phased out.

574
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,460
I will make Literature major great again.

575
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,270
Drink the whole bucket and I’ll help you.

576
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,740
Are you getting lost again?

577
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,550
Akk, you puppy dog.

578
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,960
You’re such a goldfish.

579
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,520
Without you, I still have Enchanté.

580
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,690
Can you see that
Enchanté is writing me back?

581
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,930
I want to know who he is.

582
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,900
If you want to know that bad,
I’ll help you look for that Te-Te guy of yours.
