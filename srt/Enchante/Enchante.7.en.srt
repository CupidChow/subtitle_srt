1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,940
There's a song I want you to listen to, Theo.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,740
I wrote it with all my heart.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,900
Is it nice?

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,020
Yes.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,350
Very melodious.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,000
Saifa sent it to me.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,110
I'm glad you came to my exhibition.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,430
Do you really know who Enchanté is?

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,160
So the Enchanté guy is a lefty.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,740
What I know for sure
is that Phupha isn't Enchanté.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,760
Natee isn't either.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,320
That leaves us with Wayo and Saifa.

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,070
Saifa is writing with his left hand.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,230
I...

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,910
I'm a lefty too.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
But...

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,100
I prefer to write with my right hand.

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,970
What's even your point then?

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,000
Theo.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,360
I need to talk to you.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,560
Sure.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,210
Can we talk in private?

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,840
Don't go.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,850
Stay.

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,840
Akk is my friend.

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,670
You can just say what you want.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,660
I'm just curious what you think
of what I sent you last night.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,080
Do you like it?

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,960
It's good.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,930
Perfectly fit to be
your Enchanté, right?

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,090
What did he send you?

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,570
I told you. Saifa wrote a song.

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,530
He wrote the second verse last night

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,120
and sent it to me to listen.

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,530
Why did he send it to you?

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,110
Why couldn't I?

37
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,510
I want to listen to the song as well.

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,520
How about you send me too?

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,980
Once I finish the whole song,

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,270
you'll be the first to hear it, Theo.

41
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,490
Sure.

42
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,050
What are you smiling at?

43
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,690
Nothing.

44
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
His song is good.

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,090
And you're telling me because?

46
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,330
1 2 Hey!

47
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,950
(Go kill.)

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Hurry up.

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Did Ton's team pay
you to take their pictures?

50
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,750
I'm just capturing the match overall.

51
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,400
Capturing how they play.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,110
What am I supposed to do here then?

53
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,040
You can be my assistant.

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,390
Let me know when people scream.

55
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,840
In case I miss something.

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,170
Alright.

57
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,330
It's nice over there.

58
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,140
Where?

59
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,710
Can you see it?

60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,270
Let's see.

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
What is this photo?

62
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Your hands were shaking.

63
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,780
I was just checking the light.

64
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,290
Theo.

65
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,730
Yes?

66
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,950
Here. It's yours.

67
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,770
Why are you giving it to me?

68
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,160
I won because of you.

69
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Akk, take photos of us first.

70
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,730
What are you playing?

71
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,700
I really want you to have it.

72
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,430
Take it back. I don't want it.

73
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,770
Theo, wait.

74
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,760
That was so embarrassing.

75
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,970
Why did Wayo say that to you?

76
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,430
Don't ask me. Who knows?

77
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,620
I do.

78
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Why did you give me your medal?

79
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,410
I won because I got
encouragement from you.

80
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,670
When did I ever
give you encouragement?

81
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,040
When we wrote to each other

82
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,080
in that book.

83
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,700
Stop saying you're Enchanté already.

84
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,720
Well, I really am Enchanté.

85
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,850
Besides, I don't need
to prove it like Phupha did.

86
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,690
Anyone can fake that handwriting.

87
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,240
How do I know
you're the real Enchanté?

88
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,410
There will be a victory
party at my place tonight.

89
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,950
I want you to come.

90
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,830
Can I bring my friend along?

91
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,680
Of course.

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,620
No problem at all.

93
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,940
See you tonight, Theo.

94
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,090
Are you really going?

95
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,780
Don't you remember the last time?

96
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,160
He got you so drunk.

97
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,930
That's why you need to come along.

98
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,260
This is so shady.

99
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,340
Because it's shady,

100
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,550
we will finally know if
he told the truth or not.

101
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,660
If not, I will get to
know why he lied to me.

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Come with me.

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,430
You don't need to ask.

104
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,630
I'm so coming with you.

105
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
Why is there only one?

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I didn't know you wanted it too.

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,690
When I asked you to go
grab something to eat, you said no.

108
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,360
When Wayo asked you to go to his
party, you weren't reluctant at all.

109
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,190
What is the matter with you now?

110
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,820
Nothing.

111
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Menteur!

112
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,100
You just said I was bullshitting.

113
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
You figured out the meaning?

114
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,920
I've developed, sir.

115
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,850
I'm not always dumb.

116
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,110
I might know things quite late,

117
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,330
but I eventually know.

118
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,370
That's not true.

119
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,990
There's something you still don't know.

120
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,360
Thanks for always being by my side.

121
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,990
Do you know what I said?

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
'm not telling you.

123
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,450
I think I do.

124
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,920
You just said...

125
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
I'm so cool.

126
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,700
I look cool even when I eat bread.

127
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,430
You're right.

128
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,850
Menteur, asshole.

129
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,850
Stop it.

130
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,040
Will you share that
bread with me or not?

131
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,060
I won't.

132
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,120
I don't care.

133
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,990
I want some.

134
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,530
Happy now?

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,130
Happy, my ass!

136
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,420
I didn't get to taste the sausage.

137
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,140
The sausage is mine.

138
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,580
If you want it, take it.

139
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,820
Are you challenging me?

140
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,480
Come on.

141
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,430
Akk!

142
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
What a cheapskate!

143
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,960
I'll go get something
to eat in the canteen.

144
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,620
Right. I'm still hungry too.

145
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,010
Hey. Wait.

146
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,270
Oops!

147
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,420
Static shock.

148
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,270
Damn it, Akk!

149
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,570
Stop it already.

150
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,440
All right. No more static shock.

151
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,170
See?

152
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,640
You're such a prankster, Akk.

153
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
I hate static shocks.

154
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,890
They say we should hold hands
like this when we get static shocked.

155
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
See? It's gone.

156
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,980
That's nonsense.

157
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,140
Do you use this trick to hit on people?

158
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,380
I never hit on anyone.

159
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,980
You're hitting on me right now.

160
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,770
Well...

161
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,690
You're blushing
because of my little tease, huh?

162
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,840
Blushing?

163
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,430
If this is what you call hit on,
then I've been hitting on you for so long already.

164
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,180
Blushing?

165
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,420
No. You are blushing.

166
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,850
Your ears are so red.

167
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,740
Your ears are redder.

168
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,570
How do you know mine are redder?

169
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,620
You wanna see?

170
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,050
See?

171
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,910
Don't move.

172
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,610
Look.

173
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,070
Is it clear?

174
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,450
You call me little bro Theo but
you're the one acting like a child here.

175
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,220
Just eat.

176
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
Theo.

177
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,000
Thanks for always being by my side too.

178
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,770
Why are you thanking me?

179
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Thanks for always being by my side.

180
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,020
You know what it means?

181
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,710
I don't.

182
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,470
But it's your eyes
that tell me the meaning.

183
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,990
Theo,

184
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,360
do not do this to anyone.

185
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,620
Even if they don't know the language,

186
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,940
they can tell from the look you give.

187
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,270
Including those Te-Te guys.

188
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,510
Do you get it?

189
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,620
I do.

190
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I won't say this to anyone.

191
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,620
Good.

192
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,340
Now try to eat as much as you can

193
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,590
so Wayo can't get you drunk tonight.

194
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,180
Why should I be afraid?

195
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,350
I have you with me.

196
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,510
Right?

197
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,170
Now eat.

198
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,370
If you passed me that ball,
we'd get one more goal.

199
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,060
But you did great.

200
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,060
You're awesome.

201
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,770
Hey, Captain.

202
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,180
We won today.

203
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,940
What are you treating us to?

204
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,200
Anything.

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,320
Yo, we need to talk.

206
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,470
Hi, Teacher.

207
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,410
What is it?

208
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Do you want to talk about that thing?

209
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
Have you found a way to deal with it?

210
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,800
Can you please wait?

211
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,190
I need more time

212
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,040
I don't think I can
keep it a secret much longer.

213
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,170
Don't you trust me at all?

214
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
You know me.

215
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,780
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

216
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,970
Can you make it quick then?

217
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,700
Sure. I promise.

218
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,550
Our club finally survived being canceled.

219
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,110
You're happy now?

220
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,950
It feels so great.

221
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,760
Satisfied, huh?

222
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,010
You're really sweaty.

223
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,060
Is it hot? Your face is so red.

224
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,910
It is. That's why I'm sweating.

225
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
Come here. I'll wipe them for you.

226
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,950
Turn that way.

227
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
I'll be fine.

228
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,030
I should go find an air-con over there.

229
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,710
Sure.

230
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,090
Natee.

231
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,640
Have you seen this picture?

232
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,910
What picture?

233
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,180
Look.

234
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,250
Wayo confessed his feelings for Theo.

235
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,600
The whole campus knows about this.

236
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,330
Are you okay?

237
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Why do I feel like

238
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,590
I'm losing something?

239
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
You mean

240
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,750
Theo?

241
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
Yes.

242
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,430
So you really like Theo?

243
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,650
Wayo,

244
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,790
you did it at last.

245
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,690
I always asked you for this
bottle but you never let me drink it.

246
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,390
I've saved it for a special day like today.

247
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,150
By the way,

248
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,980
what are you going to do with Akk?

249
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,170
You must help me.

250
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,040
Try to keep him away.

251
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
This is weird.

252
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
I don't think his team
members are in the room.

253
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,100
You can trust me on that.

254
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,210
I don't know.
You're probably overthinking it.

255
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Hey, Theo.

256
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,420
Where's everyone?

257
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,070
They already went
to celebrate somewhere else.

258
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,550
It's just me and Ton left here.

259
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,810
Come on in.

260
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,890
Just wait for it.

261
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,340
He'll try to get rid of me
so he can be alone with you.

262
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Hey, Akk.

263
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,850
Didn't you bring any gifts?

264
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,610
The host might get upset.

265
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,450
Let's go down and buy something.

266
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,910
But don't worry.

267
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,870
I will not let you be alone with Wayo.

268
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,100
I ordered something to be delivered here.

269
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,840
Let's not waste our time buying it ourselves.

270
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,490
Do you really think I have no manners?

271
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,400
Wow! You have Zidane jersey?

272
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,950
Of course.

273
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,880
There's his autograph too.

274
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,530
Super limited.

275
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,590
Is this his real autograph?

276
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,260
Of course.

277
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,210
Haven't you seen one?

278
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,610
No.

279
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,480
This must be really pricey.

280
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,750
Well, I'm rich.

281
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,990
Come on. Let's get our party started.

282
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,550
Shouldn't we celebrate some other day?

283
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,360
We should do it when everyone is here.

284
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,070
Don't you want to
know why I invited you here?

285
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,760
Do you want to know
why I became Enchanté?

286
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,100
Tonight, I'd want to tell you a truth.

287
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,330
And when are you going to talk about it?

288
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Guys, let's play a game.

289
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,910
What game now?

290
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,970
The Coup board game.

291
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,060
No. I want to go home.

292
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,820
You can go ahead, Akk.

293
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,070
But Theo must stay.

294
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,040
Otherwise,
we have nothing to talk about.

295
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,650
It's fine.

296
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,570
Just one game.

297
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,100
All right then.

298
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,360
Count me in

299
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,430
I'm fully awake now.

300
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,680
So we are all playing?

301
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,710
Just play and get it over with.

302
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,690
Where's the fun in that?

303
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,190
Do you want to bet?

304
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,850
If you lose, you do anything I say.

305
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,950
If I lose, you ask me to do anything.

306
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,790
Fine. Game on.

307
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,350
I'm Assassin.

308
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,650
I'm killing you.

309
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,720
You can't.

310
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,080
I'm Contessa.

311
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,050
I challenge you.

312
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,850
For real?

313
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,490
If you're not lying, reveal the card.

314
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,790
Bottoms up.

315
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,060
I'm Assassin.

316
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,030
I'm killing you.

317
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,630
You can't.

318
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm Contessa.

319
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,550
I challenge you.

320
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,540
What?

321
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,520
You just said you were Duke.

322
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,990
You lied to me.

323
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,420
It's a game, my friend.

324
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,240
Sorry.

325
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,290
Bottoms up, Theo.

326
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,250
Here.

327
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Hey, Akk.

328
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,680
You're driving and I just beat you.

329
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,880
Let's call it even.

330
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,180
My turn now.

331
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,220
I'm taking your coins.

332
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,710
How can you do that?
Are you Captain?

333
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,730
I am.

334
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,970
Both in the game
and on the football field.

335
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,190
You just said you're Duke.

336
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,840
I challenge you.

337
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
You see, Theo?

338
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,170
I'm not lying.

339
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,150
I'm an honest man.

340
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Akk, can you handle it?

341
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,730
Let's start again.

342
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,640
Akk, you're such a heavyweight.

343
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,860
Hey, Akk!

344
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,570
Are you okay?

345
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,860
Akk, get up.

346
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,320
Where are you guys going?

347
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,920
Home.

348
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,460
Why don't you stay a bit longer?

349
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,420
Damn! Why did you drink so much?

350
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,180
Don't go yet.

351
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,780
Wayo.

352
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,230
Wayo.

353
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,660
Aren't you gonna stop them?

354
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,360
Stop!

355
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,830
I'm going to beat you.

356
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,390
Beat, my ass!

357
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,880
We're almost there.

358
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,300
This is exhausting.

359
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,550
We're here.

360
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,470
Am I in my room already?

361
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,140
It's my car.

362
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,830
Where are you taking me,
little bro Theo?

363
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,510
Little bro again?

364
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,540
You're drunk so shut up.

365
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,700
You're cute, little bro.

366
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,010
I don't get drunk so easily.

367
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,410
You're drunk.

368
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,920
I dragged you all the
way here from Wayo's room.

369
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,440
I said I'm not drunk.

370
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
You are.

371
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,220
I'm not.

372
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,860
You are.

373
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,490
I'm not.

374
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,150
You are drunk.

375
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,230
Say Ďdrunk' one more time

376
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,350
and I'll...

377
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,550
You're drunk.

378
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,970
I'm the king of the world!

379
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,960
Akk, sit tight.

380
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,020
I'll take you home.

381
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,390
I don't want to go home.

382
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,200
Where do you want to go then?

383
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm taking you to France.

384
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,090
Let's go.

385
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,570
You know, this road design was
inspired by an avenue in France.

386
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,480
Where in France?

387
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,340
Champs-…sées.

388
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,340
Champs-…lysées.

389
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,800
Yeah, that one.

390
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,840
I know you miss France so much.

391
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,670
But I can't take you to Champs-…lysées.

392
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
So I took you here instead.

393
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,210
I don't miss it that much.

394
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,420
I was quite lonely there.

395
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,570
I didn't have friends.

396
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,190
The scenery though,
I must admit it's the best.

397
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:42,590
But now I'm feeling better
than when I was there.

398
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,680
Because I have you.

399
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
So I don't have to be alone.

400
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,770
Should we take a walk?

401
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,750
Why is it blurry?

402
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,990
It's not good.

403
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,070
Do it again.

404
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
How is it?

405
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,370
It's so slanted.

406
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,640
Give it here.

407
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Watch and learn.

408
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Look.

409
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Hey, it's great!

410
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Let's try some other angles.

411
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,830
What are you doing?

412
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Here.

413
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,830
Looking good, huh?

414
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,190
Why did you take my photo?

415
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,160
Capture the scenery.

416
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,640
Nah. I always take
photos of the scenery.

417
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,110
You always take photos of me too.

418
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,920
It's my turn to take yours.

419
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,990
I don't like to get my picture taken.

420
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,520
Me neither.

421
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,090
But you don't care.

422
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,100
Give it to me. I'm taking your photo.

423
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,010
Be still.

424
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,420
Make it look like a candid one.

425
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,910
And you said you didn't
like your photo taken.

426
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
You're definitely posing.

427
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,370
I might have things I like

428
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,240
but I don't want you to know it.

429
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,050
Are you taking any photos?

430
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,610
I'm tired here.

431
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Done.

432
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,740
What did you mean?

433
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,390
What?

434
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm drunk tonight and I talk a lot.

435
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:33,590
You said you have things you like
but you don't want me to know it.

436
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,430
What did you mean by that?

437
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,500
Ah! I meant taking photos.

438
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,870
Why?

439
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,020
What do you think I like?

440
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Let's go check some other places.

441
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,250
Teach me.

442
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,280
I want to be a
good photographer like you.

443
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
What are you doing now?

444
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
This?

445
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,720
A drink before bed.

446
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,410
Why are you still drinking?

447
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,840
We're not playing the game anymore.

448
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm playing my own game.

449
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,710
What game?

450
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,360
Easy there.

451
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,970
Testing my limits.

452
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,090
Testing your limits? How?

453
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,270
I might get bolder when I'm drunk.

454
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,350
What do you mean Ďbold?'

455
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,380
What are you going to do?

456
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,940
Like, sing a weird song.

457
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,440
Dance a crazy move.

458
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,290
Call my ex.

459
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,260
Some people might
even confess their feelings.

460
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I think...

461
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,130
what you just said

462
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
you can do it without being drunk.

463
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,630
You're right.

464
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,070
? Je t'aime ŗ la felie ?

465
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,720
? Di da di da di di ?

466
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,570
What are you mumbling about?

467
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,680
I'm singing the song you put on earlier.

468
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,540
? Je t'aime ŗ la lafie ?

469
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,860
There's just one
word I can recognize there.

470
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,980
What word? Je t'aime?

471
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,260
Je t'aime?

472
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,520
Do you even realize

473
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,990
what you're saying?

474
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Je t'aime.

475
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,930
Do you know what it means?

476
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,370
I do.

477
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,640
If I don't, I won't say it to you.

478
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,500
Then tell me.

479
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,220
When people say Je t'aime,
what do they want to do to each other?

480
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
They want to...

481
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,110
sit and look at the stars

482
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,540
and keep looking into each other's eyes.

483
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Or maybe...

484
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,130
they want to do something more.

485
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,780
More than just looking at the stars, drinking,

486
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,700
and looking into each other's eyes.

487
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,190
So?

488
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,980
Did I give you the right
definition of the word Je t'aime?

489
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,660
I don't know.

490
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Probably.

491
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Akk, stop drinking.

492
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,050
You're wasted.

493
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,190
Hey, Akk!

494
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,900
Are you all right?

495
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,610
Walk straight.

496
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,770
I'm walking as steady as usual.

497
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,870
Quit acting like you're cool.

498
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,090
We're finally here.

499
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,020
Thank you.

500
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,680
Can you get home?

501
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,440
Should I walk you home?

502
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,610
You plant a rose?

503
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,500
I got it from the room
where we watched a movie together.

504
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,040
That's why it disappeared.

505
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,960
You're the one that took it.

506
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,920
I was afraid people would get rid of it.

507
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,280
It was our important witness.

508
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,000
Witness to what?

509
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,750
Don't you remember?

510
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,210
I thought you did.

511
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,270
So it wasn't just a dream?

512
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,920
Akk.

513
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,300
Akk.

514
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,080
Answer me.

515
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,440
Akk!

516
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,100
Akk!

517
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,360
Get up.

518
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,890
You alright?

519
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,850
You know it, right?

520
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,700
You know the reason
I've done all these things?

521
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,610
Hey.

522
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,790
Why didn't you finish what you started?

523
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,470
Don't you remember?

524
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,970
I thought you did.

525
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,710
So it wasn't just a dream?

526
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,570
You know it, right?

527
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,100
You know the reason
I've done all these things?

528
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
I drew you a picture.

529
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,950
I don't want it.

530
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,290
And stay away from me.

531
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,870
But I put my heart into drawing it.

532
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,300
Theo.

533
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,940
I want you to know that I can draw again

534
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,790
because I have you as my inspiration.

535
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,690
I haven't felt this way
about anyone in a long time.

536
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,430
I might not be your Enchanté.

537
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,270
But I want to know you better every day.

538
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,780
Thank you for having a feeling for me.

539
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
But I can't accept it.

540
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,830
I know Wayo confessed
his feelings for you in public.

541
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,930
Everyone knows about it.

542
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,250
So I came here to talk to you

543
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,220
about the real Enchanté.

544
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,270
Well...

545
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
I should go then.

546
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
What did he ask you to do now?

547
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,780
Nothing.

548
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,270
He just said that lefty guy wasn't Wayo.

549
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,650
So Saifa is Enchanté?

550
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,810
He didn't say.

551
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,590
Never mind.

552
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,670
I have something more important to say.

553
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,070
I have something
important to say as well.

554
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,250
I know why Wayo lied
and said he's Enchanté.

555
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,140
So you really like Theo?

556
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,600
I just wanted to use him at first.

557
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:06,370
But then something tells
me I have a feeling for him.

558
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,490
And why are you tossing it in the trash?

559
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,320
I know it's not gonna happen.

560
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,420
I should get over him.

561
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Apart from him being your inspiration,

562
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,030
is there any other
reasons why you like him?

563
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,060
I might be able to
help you find more inspiration.

564
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,200
I don't want you to quit drawing.

565
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Thanks for your concern.

566
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,670
But you don't need to do anything.

567
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,110
You've already been so helpful to me.

568
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,520
Thank you.

569
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,610
What should we do?

570
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,420
It didn't go as planned at all last night.

571
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,010
Don't give up yet.

572
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,660
Theo is naive.

573
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,930
Yo, have you found the way out?

574
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,940
And why didn't
you reply to my messages?

575
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,880
I lost my phone.

576
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,240
The budget proposa
document is due today.

577
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,010
Have you got the
money to pay back yet?

578
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,340
Give me more time.

579
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,470
I will find a way to return that money.

580
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,160
If this escalates to the university
board, I won't be able to help you.

581
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,790
You came to see me, Theo?

582
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,420
I know you're not Enchanté.

583
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,350
And I know you lied to me

584
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,360
because you wanted my help
with the club money that you took.

585
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
How did you know that?

586
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,560
I know why Wayo lied and said he's Enchanté.

587
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,830
I think he forged Teacher Fon's
signature to get the club budget in advance

588
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,470
and spent it all on gambling.

589
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,130
Are you sure?

590
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,990
Last night, I grabbed Wayo's phone by mistake.

591
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,350
The phone isn't secured by a password.

592
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,030
I saw his chat history with Teacher Fon.

593
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
Is he tricking Theo to get something now?

594
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,430
And this is the receipt he
paid to the online gambling website.

595
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,750
Take a look.

596
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,030
He's lying to you because he wants
the bigger budget for the football club.

597
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,870
So he can pay for the money he lost.

598
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,820
Did you really spend the
club money on gambling?

599
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,820
Theo, listen to me.

600
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,130
I didn't want to lie.

601
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,970
But I had no choice.

602
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,160
Why are you such a scumbag?

603
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,720
I didn't have any other way.

604
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,120
Lying to you wasn't my intention.

605
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,960
It was Ton's.

606
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,300
He was the one that
told me about Enchanté.

607
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Let's go, Wayo.

608
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:35,470
I just found you the way to get money.

609
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,260
Ton.

610
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,910
You're a f*cking bastard.

611
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,650
How could you do that?

612
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Theo, I'm sorry for what he did.

613
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,000
Please don't take it to Dr. Thamrong.

614
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,790
I know what he did was wrong
but he's done so many decent
things for the club and the university.

615
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,920
I want to give him a chance to fix it.

616
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,850
You know about this too, Teacher?

617
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,250
I know he forged my
signature and took the money.

618
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,200
But I didn't know he'd
deceive you to get the money.

619
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,660
I thought he had
some other way to earn it.

620
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,790
How could you do it?

621
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,820
I didn't have a choice.

622
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,030
I don't want to get fired.

623
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,210
You're selfish.

624
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,500
You use your problem as an excuse.

625
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,400
Do you think that's okay?

626
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,540
You can do that to anyone.

627
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,580
But you can't do that to Theo.

628
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,070
I won't put up with it.

629
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,300
Stop it.

630
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,840
Stop!

631
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,820
Wayo, stop!

632
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,390
Don't make it bigger than it's already is.

633
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,930
Akk, stop it.

634
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Let's go, Akk.

635
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,960
Enough.

636
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,140
Akk, stop.

637
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,420
I'm letting you go

638
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,280
but you need to calm yourself first.

639
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,250
Okay?

640
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
Everyone wants to
be Enchanté to use you.

641
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,260
To get something from you.

642
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,280
I didn't think things would come this far.

643
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,930
I don't want to see you fooled again.

644
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,470
I don't want you to
search for Enchanté anymore.

645
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,080
Akk,

646
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,920
this is between me and Theo.

647
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,360
It doesn't concern you.

648
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,650
You think you
have any right to hurt me?

649
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,700
Drop it already.

650
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,050
Don't start a fight.

651
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,760
Are you gonna hide behind
your friend's back forever?

652
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,090
Akk, stop.

653
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,130
Enough.

654
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,680
Don't waste your
time on someone like that.

655
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,400
Someone like me and what?

656
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,970
F*cking asshole!

657
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,710
It's stuck?

658
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,620
Might be.

659
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,880
Anyone there?

660
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,860
Relax.

661
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,400
Someone will
come and open it for us.

662
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,200
Yeah?

663
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,630
Here.

664
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,970
What?

665
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:04,960
Ice-cream.

666
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,820
Right now?

667
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,300
This isn't just normal ice cream.

668
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,540
It's Khai Palo ice cream
you've always wanted.

669
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,320
Where did you even find it?

670
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,870
Whatever you want, I can get it for you

671
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,660
So?

672
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,480
What on earth did you just feed me?

673
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,900
Not good?

674
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,990
Have a bite.

675
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,900
Give it to me.

676
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,690
I'll finish it.

677
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,390
You don't have to if it's not good.

678
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,280
You found it for me.

679
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,440
It's a waste to throw it away.

680
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,130
You don't need to do that for me.

681
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,190
It's so bad,
you don't have to put up with it.

682
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:51,840
Give it here.

683
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,390
Thank you.

684
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Nobody shows up yet.

685
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,210
You're starting to get rash.

686
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,410
So itchy.

687
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,020
Don't scratch it.
The more you do, the itchier it gets.

688
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,980
It feels super
itchy every time I sweat.

689
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,160
What should I do?

690
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,730
Let's do this then.

691
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:40,110
Akk, I'm feeling better.

692
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,680
Stop scratching.

693
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,990
While we're waiting,

694
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,960
should we find something to do?

695
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,480
What are you doing?

696
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,990
What do you think I’m doing?

697
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,330
Do you think I don't
know what you want?

698
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,030
Are you deceiving my friend too?

699
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,390
Why would I deceive him?

700
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,470
Everyone approaches him because
they want something from him.

701
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:10,370
Why do you want to protect me?

702
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,000
I told you to stop
searching for that Te-Te guy.

703
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,400
It doesn’t matter who it is.

704
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,750
Hold up.

705
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,270
Do you have
anything to say to me?

706
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,740
[I just don’t know what I
should do anymore.]

707
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,820
You don’t need to do anything.

708
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,180
Can I…

709
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:32,060
be your Enchanté?
