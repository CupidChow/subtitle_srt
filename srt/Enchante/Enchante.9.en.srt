1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,890
Why do you want to protect me?

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,890
It's good to be a rose.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,890
People see you
and know what you mean.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,880
The Enchanté search
journey is so damn pointless.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,490
Why did you drag me up here?

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,060
Because I'm your Enchanté.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,710
You're not Enchanté.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,040
I was in the library all day that day.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,410
Listen carefully.

10
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,070
The Enchanté you're
looking for is your friend Theo.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,340
I didn't know why you did it.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,570
The more I did, the more I wanted
to know how you felt about me.

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,760
Do you know now
how I feel about you?

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,820
I like you, Theo.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,540
I've liked you for so long.

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,580
I've been waiting to
hear that from you.

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,530
Can I kiss you?

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,500
Kiss you as your Enchanté.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,020
The stars are gorgeous tonight.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,930
I don't see any stars.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,000
You're delusional.

22
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,800
Don't kill my imagination.

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,270
Don't be nervous.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,010
Just relax.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm relaxing here.

26
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,440
You are petrified like a fossil.

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,240
Don't be shy.

28
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,770
Don't shake me.

29
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,190
Well, I want to.

30
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,050
Stop.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,440
I said don't shake me.

32
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,920
Look who is nervous now?

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,900
I'm not.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,350
It is weirdly pleasant

35
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,200
to be able to hug you like this.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,690
You used to hug me a lot.

37
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,950
It's not the same.

38
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,110
You were just a friend back then.

39
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,890
So,

40
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,080
what am I now?

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
What are you doing?

42
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,680
What am I to you now?

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,600
My boyfriend.

44
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,050
Um.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,730
You agreed just like that?

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,660
What do you expect me to do then?

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,550
Akk.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,760
Let me kiss you back.

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,710
You can't.

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,190
I'm the only one allowed to kiss.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
That, I just let you do it.

52
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,720
So?

53
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,300
You're home. Aren't you getting off?

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't want to leave you yet.

55
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,560
Will you come to my room first?

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,350
Hey!

57
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,400
What are you saying?

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,510
What?

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
We've just become boyfriends…

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,830
I just want to give you something.

61
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,070
What is your mind thinking?

62
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,670
Listen to what you said.

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
Anyone would think the same.

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,460
You always have a
dirty mind, don't you?

65
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,160
Let's just go.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,450
Let's go get whatever
you want me to have.

67
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,330
Stop talking.

68
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,690
Here. It's yours.

69
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,460
Why?

70
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,640
I want you to take care of it.

71
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,360
Because you're too lazy. I know.

72
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,950
You're such a black thumb.

73
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,540
No.

74
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,990
I'm giving it to you

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,090
because it's our witness.

76
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,440
Witness to what?

77
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,120
That night in the exhibition room,

78
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,140
it wasn't a dream.

79
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,570
Hey.

80
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,010
Did you just say I was weak?

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,560
Do you know

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,600
how much I wanted
you to confirm that?

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,550
You just never said anything.

84
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,460
I was afriad you'd get mad.

85
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,160
If I was mad,

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,710
why would I kiss you back?

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,940
Shit!

88
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,740
How could I be so dumb?

89
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,610
I assumed that because
you came from France,

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,750
it was automatic
for you to kiss back.

91
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,600
You're freaking dumb.

92
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,680
Take good care of the rose

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,250
so it always reminds
you of a dumb guy here.

94
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,700
Dumbass!

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,520
Theo!

96
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,540
You seriously did that?

97
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,460
Yes, since you're such a dumbass.

98
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm off now.

99
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,550
Dumbass.

100
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,410
Wow!

101
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,540
You don't need to bring a lot.

102
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,250
It's fine.

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,370
We can make a big pot of it.

104
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,190
Woah!

105
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,820
What's going on here?

106
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,460
Theo is making Khai Palo for us.

107
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,940
Awesome!

108
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,540
Free food!

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,820
You really are?

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,610
Yes. I've got skills, sir.

111
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,830
It's a special Khai Palo
recipe I'm cooking here.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,220
All right, sir.

113
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,490
Let's go.

114
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,970
Egg, do you think
they are acting weird?

115
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,080
I think they are really,
really weird.

116
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,580
What is going on
between those two?

117
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I think they seem mushy,
clingy, lovey-dovey somehow.

118
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,970
Argh!!

119
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,260
Why are you staring at me?

120
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,080
Find yourself something to do.

121
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,510
I'm doing it right now.

122
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,260
Doing what?

123
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,120
Staring at you.

124
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,040
Why?

125
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,940
Can't I?

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Fine.

127
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,570
Shit! It's hot.

128
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,030
Why can't you be more careful?

129
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,660
You're lucky it's no swelling.

130
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,110
Thank you.

131
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,540
I won't let you touch
anything heated anymore.

132
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,430
I'll handle it.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,830
Come on. It's nothing.

134
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,970
Don't exaggerate.

135
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,340
Why do you love eating Khai Palo?

136
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,530
My grandmother loved
making me this menu.

137
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,580
It was superb.

138
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,960
She had her secrets.

139
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,750
I said we must not
rush it when cooking it.

140
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,200
We must take time to braise it.

141
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,330
Give it our full attention.

142
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,600
‘Cooking Khai Palo is
like building love,' she said.

143
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,530
The longer it takes,
the better love is.

144
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,430
Like us, right?

145
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,940
Yuck.

146
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,380
Your Khai Palo
doesn't need any sugar

147
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,370
because I'm so sweet.

148
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,160
I just want to hit
you with the ladle.

149
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,980
I'm not used to this at all.

150
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,700
Here it is, Im, Egg.

151
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,030
Smells so good.

152
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,440
Enjoy the food.
I made it with all my heart.

153
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,530
Aren't you going to eat it with us?

154
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,890
I'll be out with Akk.

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Are you two
going on a sweet date?

156
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,330
Come on.

157
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,190
Let me get the door for you.

158
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,780
And close it for you.

159
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,190
Where are you taking me?

160
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,190
Champ de Mars, Mr. Akk.

161
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,570
What…de what?

162
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,920
Champ de Mars.

163
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,070
It's a park in front of the Eiffel Tower

164
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
where people like to go picnic.

165
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,360
Ah! It's the long park
I saw in the pictures?

166
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,370
That's the one.

167
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,650
I walked past it every day but
didn't get a chance to enjoy it.

168
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,300
Why not?

169
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,880
Because I lived alone.

170
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,190
When I saw people
going in pairs or groups,

171
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,790
I felt a little down.

172
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,540
I would be down too.

173
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,160
Right?

174
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,060
But I have you now.

175
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,010
It's time for me to
sit and enjoy a park too.

176
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,750
No problem, sir.

177
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,140
I'm happy to sit
next to you in the park.

178
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,590
Always exaggerate.

179
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,400
Let's go.

180
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,750
Let's go.

181
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,340
I remember you love
to eat it with lots of soup.

182
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,850
Good memory.

183
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,580
You like to photograph landscapes
rather than people, don't you?

184
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
That's right.

185
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,560
I barely take people's
photos unless I get paid for it.

186
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,030
Except for your photos.

187
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,100
1 2.

188
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,360
Clearly,

189
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,190
these are the eyes
of someone very happy.

190
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,880
You're cheesy.

191
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,040
So, why do you favor capturing
scenery shots over portraits?

192
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,070
I'm not sure if you remember this.

193
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,370
My father's video footage
was used in many big films.

194
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,520
So I dream of collecting lots of footage
and people use them in their movies too.

195
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,710
So…

196
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,300
my photos you've taken,
can they be used in any movie at all?

197
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,330
No, not at all.

198
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,230
Why not?

199
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,550
I'm possessive.

200
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,640
I'll just keep them to myself.

201
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,120
Actually,

202
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,050
I have a dream too.

203
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,210
I want to be a writer.

204
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,210
But damn,

205
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,780
it's not so easy.

206
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,540
You're studying literature.

207
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,910
You read a lot.

208
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,410
It shouldn't be that hard for you.

209
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,690
Reading other people's work and creating
your own are two different stories.

210
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,330
That's why there are
more readers than writers.

211
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,850
You're right.

212
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,360
If my work isn't fun and interesting,

213
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,620
people won't care to read.

214
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,930
Hey.

215
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,590
I believe you can make
your dream come true.

216
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,030
I'll be your first reader.

217
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,840
Sounds good?

218
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,840
Thank you.

219
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,880
1 2.

220
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,140
Let's see.

221
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,160
Good?

222
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,390
Good.

223
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,070
You seem to love this book so much.

224
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,010
Been reading it since you were a kid.

225
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,270
I get a different
impression every time I read it.

226
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,190
When I was young,
I read it just for fun.

227
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,640
But now it can
be interpreted in many ways.

228
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,910
I didn't get it at first,

229
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,940
but I do now.

230
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,410
Adults just like to make
simple things more difficult.

231
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,680
I don't know if they do that to avoid
other people thinking they're still kids

232
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,290
or do that simply
because they're adults.

233
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
I thought I understood that.

234
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,510
But I'm starting to get confused here.

235
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,180
It sounded like a philosophy quote.

236
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,980
I don't follow.

237
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,860
It should go take some pictures.

238
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,070
Interpreting a book
into philosophy isn't my way.

239
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,390
Where are you going?

240
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,110
Around here.

241
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,040
Important things can't
be seen with the eyes.

242
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm glad to be with you, Theo.

243
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,990
Goodbye, darling.

244
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,030
Akk.

245
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,310
Are you forgetting something?

246
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,430
Come here.

247
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,310
What am I forgetting?

248
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,270
Come closer.

249
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,860
Closer.

250
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,120
That feels so good.

251
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,370
You don't forget anything.

252
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,780
You're dismissed now.

253
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,080
Get into your house.

254
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,090
I'm leaving. Bye.

255
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,530
You're home?

256
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,550
I see you've brought a lot.

257
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,600
They are for your health.

258
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,650
So you've got the money?

259
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,360
The creditor has
been calling me all day.

260
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,230
Phupha,

261
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,000
you've got the money, haven't you?

262
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,790
The scholarship money
came out today, right?

263
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,600
Phupha, son.

264
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,740
Do you have the money with you?

265
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,410
I don't!

266
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,620
My scholarship was canceled.

267
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,840
How did that happen?

268
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,560
You don't behave yourself, do you?

269
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,060
How come the more you study,
the stupider you get?

270
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
It's because of you.

271
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't have time for class because I
have to work my ass off to cover your debt.

272
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,110
The scholarship was
handed to people with better GPAs.

273
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,810
Don't you realize that at all?

274
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Are you saying it's my fault?

275
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,380
Yes.

276
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,250
It's you.
You're the hindrance to my life.

277
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,130
Mom.

278
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,290
Mom.

279
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,170
Mom.

280
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,890
Mom.

281
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,000
Nurse!

282
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,910
Nurse!

283
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,650
Mom.

284
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,110
Mom.

285
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,210
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,210
Mom, I'm sorry.

287
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,560
How are you doing these days?

288
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,960
Have you been able to adjust?

289
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,520
You look brighter than
when you just got back.

290
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Yeah. It's nice to live here.

291
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,350
I have friends who
speak the same language.

292
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,740
And…

293
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,090
I get to stay with my beloved family.

294
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,400
Plus, I get to try new things.

295
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,630
That's good.

296
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,720
By the way,

297
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,940
I was informed about the
faculty meeting they just had,

298
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,760
about the Literature Major.

299
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,790
They didn't have a conclusion on
whether to cancel the major yet.

300
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,980
They need to take a look at the
survey from the Open House first.

301
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,610
Sure.

302
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,230
The Literature Major will organize
an event on the same day

303
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,020
to promote to students attending the
interesting things about the major.

304
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,370
That's good.

305
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,080
Hm.

306
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,360
What?

307
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,520
Helping you cross the street.

308
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,620
I can do it myself.

309
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,200
So? I want to help.

310
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,540
I'm not used to this.

311
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,180
I prefer this.

312
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,920
Should I walk you to your faculty first?

313
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,220
No.

314
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,240
It's your building here.

315
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,810
Go to class.

316
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,520
Okay.

317
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,460
See you.

318
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,180
I just want to apologize for lying to you.

319
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,690
Not necessary.

320
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,350
It's fine if you don't want to hear it.

321
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,270
I just want you to know

322
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,560
why I did it.

323
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,710
I used to be a good student.

324
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,730
I wanted to be a smart student

325
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,720
so I could get away from my mother.

326
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,710
But now I know

327
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,040
I shouldn't think that way.

328
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,000
I must not leave her.

329
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,430
I must better our lives.

330
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,270
I have to cure her

331
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,650
because she's the only
person in the family I have left.

332
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,540
And I'm the only one she can rely on.

333
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,950
I'm glad to hear it.

334
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
I hope you succeed
at what you plan to you.

335
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,920
Your mom should be proud.

336
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,440
Thank you for
listening to my explanation.

337
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,370
I saw…

338
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,130
you and Akk holding
hand crossing the street.

339
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,600
So you've found
your real Enchanté, Theo?

340
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,050
Yes.

341
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,510
Now that you've found him,

342
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,580
try your best to keep him in your life.

343
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,700
Goodbye, Theo.

344
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,310
Bye.

345
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,150
Um…

346
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,840
Are you seeing Theo?

347
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,140
Why?

348
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,540
The photo of Theo on your IG,

349
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,260
people screenshot it

350
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,960
and shared it on the
university Cute Boys page.

351
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,000
[I saw them together all the time.
I thought they were friends.]

352
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,000
[What? I thought Theo was
seeing one of the ambassadors.]

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,670
[Who is this?]

354
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,740
[They don't match.]

355
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,240
So what if we're together?

356
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,250
As you can see,

357
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,000
they say you're leeching Theo.

358
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,040
And why do they need to
know about Theo and me?

359
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,970
Many people like him.

360
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,620
Now they see he's with you

361
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,400
they just can't help but gossip.

362
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,320
But it's not like I'm with him because
he's the university owner's son.

363
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,510
I know that but other people don't.

364
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,680
Theo is the center of attention.

365
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,660
You're close to him.

366
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,820
It's normal for you to be the topic too.

367
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,740
If you don't want them to talk,

368
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,860
I think you should keep a
low profile inside the university.

369
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You hadn't come to the club for days.

370
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,410
Were you busy?

371
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,060
Been having loads of work recently?

372
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,860
I didn't know why I should come.

373
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,720
Besides, you can draw again.

374
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,570
The club can continue.

375
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,080
And why are you grabbing your things?

376
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,880
Are you going out to draw?

377
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,720
I think

378
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,840
I should quit the club.

379
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,980
Akk.

380
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,460
Akk!

381
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,130
Hm.

382
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,210
Want some?

383
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,750
Let me feed you so you
can keep your hands clean.

384
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,690
Here.

385
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,040
Have a bite.

386
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,940
What's wrong?

387
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,250
Why so quiet?

388
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,320
I'm stuffed.

389
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,080
You should eat.

390
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,470
Nothing is wrong, really.

391
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,700
I just had so much to eat.

392
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,580
I just want to sit
and be absent-minded.

393
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,850
Haven't you done it?

394
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,260
Fine.

395
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,290
Be absent-minded.

396
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,470
Finish your food.

397
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,730
I have a presentation
to do this afternoon.

398
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

399
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,590
Do you really need to go that fast?

400
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,770
Yes. Want it too?

401
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,900
You go on.

402
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,600
It's so good.

403
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,610
Sorry.

404
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,380
I accidentally flicked
that bucket down there.

405
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,790
Hey, Akk!

406
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,900
It's okay.

407
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,000
I'll clean it up.

408
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,680
How do I live without you?

409
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,200
You saw the bucket falling down.

410
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,220
Why didn't you step away?

411
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,510
I guess I was waiting
for a knight to save me.

412
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,440
Of course.

413
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,250
Will you, the prince, come down the
tower and help me clean up these petals?

414
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,200
Please.

415
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,250
Fine.

416
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,130
Have you finished
with the presentation?

417
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,180
I have.

418
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,850
People up there
are cleaning things up.

419
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,820
So…

420
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,140
what are you doing here?

421
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,330
Ah!

422
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,040
I was just passing through.

423
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,620
You love taking a detour, don't you?

424
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,000
Sorry.

425
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,460
You were just passing through.

426
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,390
Akk!

427
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,750
When are we going to finish this?

428
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,380
Will you help me
clean up until tomorrow?

429
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,870
I will.

430
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,020
What about you?

431
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,640
Will you stay and help me until tomorrow,

432
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
the day after tomorrow,

433
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,220
after tomorrow,

434
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,650
and on and on?

435
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,710
No more messing around, sir.

436
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,450
Little bro Theo, give it here.

437
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,070
When will you stop
calling me little bro?

438
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,560
I forgot you weren't a brother

439
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,360
because...

440
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,800
you're my boyfriend now.

441
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Stunned, huh?

442
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,920
Did I make you blush?

443
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,420
The one being stunned here isn't me.

444
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,120
What are you doing? People can see?

445
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,090
We're boyfriends, aren't we?

446
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,840
I should go now.

447
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,810
See you in the evening.

448
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,690
Did you just steal someone's stuff?

449
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,720
Why being sneaky?

450
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,590
I'm not.

451
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm just looking around.

452
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,410
Be honest, will you?

453
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,470
Ever since lunchtime,

454
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,810
did I do anything that bothered you?

455
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,300
You can just be frank with me.

456
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,450
I care about you, Akk.

457
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm okay now.

458
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,950
Thanks.

459
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,560
I'm glad that you're here.

460
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
You just proved
what I'd always believed.

461
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,330
We all should have
someone next to us.

462
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,570
Because of you,

463
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,410
I have an idea to write a book.

464
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,920
What are you going to write?

465
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,200
About love.

466
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,610
I got inspiration from my mom and dad.

467
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,770
No wonder why they've
been together this long.

468
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,250
They have each other's backs.

469
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,630
They provide each
other with positive energy.

470
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,070
Damn!

471
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,650
Their love is so good.

472
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,880
Let's go.

473
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,220
What is it?

474
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,030
Stock transfer document.

475
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,610
I don't want any cliffhangers.

476
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,870
Alright.

477
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,270
I will consult my
lawyer and sign it for you.

478
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,960
When are we going
to stop lying to Theo?

479
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,850
We talked about this.

480
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,850
We are going to
wait until Theo graduates.

481
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,010
But that was before
Theo was back in Thailand.

482
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,460
I think we might
need to reconsider it.

483
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,590
I'm asking you. Please.

484
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,820
I'm afraid Theo can't take it.

485
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,550
Our son is a grown man.

486
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,470
I'm sure he will understand.

487
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,420
I know him better than you do.

488
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,810
Please do as I say.

489
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,610
I think we should
just tell him the truth.

490
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,370
I'm tired of helping you cover it up.

491
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,610
Do you think I want to do this?

492
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,490
Do you think I
feel nothing doing this?

493
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,410
If we had told him, things
wouldn't have been this complicated.

494
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,290
Is something wrong here?

495
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,290
Theo.

496
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,390
Nothing.

497
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
We were just chatting.

498
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,490
Your dad is a little stressed out.
He will be fine.

499
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,170
Theo,

500
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,050
you said your senior
wanted to record a song.

501
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,140
Saifa?

502
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,770
Yes. That one.

503
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,640
You can schedule him to come see me.

504
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,000
Sure.

505
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm worried.

506
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,460
When I was walking into the house,
I saw my parents fighting.

507
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,620
It looked serious somehow.

508
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Must be something about work.

509
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,500
But my mom said something about me.

510
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,520
They said they didn't want
to lie to me about something.

511
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,970
What would they
be lying to you about?

512
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,730
Exactly.

513
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,540
You might have just misheard them.

514
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,910
You think?

515
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,360
I think you did.

516
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,150
I have a bad feeling about this.

517
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
They probably have
their problem to deal with.

518
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,450
I think your parents
are finding a way to fix it.

519
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,530
I don't want you to be concerned.

520
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,450
I said you wanted to write.

521
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,340
Have you started?

522
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,500
Haven't.

523
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,110
You haven't?

524
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,040
Start writing already.

525
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,410
Looking forward to reading it here.

526
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,210
When did you go to bed?

527
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,230
3 a.m.

528
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,220
I wanted to finish the prologue.

529
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,960
You don't need to work too hard.

530
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,030
I'm not in a rush.

531
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm not either. I just wanted to do it.

532
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,060
I thought you rushed
because I told you to.

533
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,950
There, there.

534
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,170
I rushed it for you too.

535
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,940
Take me to eat something delish.

536
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,920
Um.

537
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,520
See you after class.

538
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,330
What are you guys going to eat?

539
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,610
Can I tag along?

540
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,170
Kidding.

541
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,220
I just wanted to come by
and say thanks for helping.

542
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:45,640
Sure.

543
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,360
I'm sorry, Akk,

544
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,030
for fooling you.

545
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,670
It wasn't Theo's fault, really.

546
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,880
It was me.

547
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,610
I want to be a singer.

548
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Theo wanted to quit
the plan a long time ago.

549
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,980
If you want to be mad,
be mad at me.

550
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,020
I'm not mad at you.

551
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,470
It was good, actually.

552
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,780
A dumb man like me deserved it.

553
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,830
You triggered me
to realize my own heart.

554
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,050
So when are you
going to do the recording?

555
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,060
Today.

556
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,830
I need to go now.

557
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,740
Congratulations to a
professional musician-to-be.

558
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,230
Thank you.

559
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,830
I'm taking off now.

560
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,640
So…

561
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,120
what should we eat?

562
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,850
Exactly.

563
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,170
Um…

564
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,830
Why are you repeating my ‘Um..?'

565
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,630
Um..

566
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,990
Should we go
eat something in my room?

567
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,740
Damn you!

568
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:08,990
Hello.

569
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,930
Hi.

570
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,410
Are you Saifa?

571
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:11,950
I am.

572
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,930
Have a seat.

573
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,610
Thank you.

574
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,870
I've listened to your song.

575
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,610
It's really nice.

576
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,730
Should we just jump into
the recording room today?

577
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,970
Sure.

578
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,960
You ready?

579
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,400
I am.

592
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,700
Thanks to you, Theo,

593
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,420
for giving me a
chance to follow my dreams.

594
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,130
It's a shame I
met your mom too late.

595
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,420
It's not too late.

596
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,150
I heard her music
company is closing down.

597
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,720
What did you say?

598
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,390
I heard the employees say
your mother sold all of her shares.

599
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,510
And she's stepping out
by the end of the month.

600
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,440
Theo.

601
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,580
Theo.

602
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,330
You're home.

603
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,620
Ah.

604
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,520
Thanks.

605
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,330
Want me to go inside with you?

606
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,040
I'm worried about you.

607
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,640
That's fine.

608
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,580
I just want to
ask my mom something.

609
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,030
I will fill you in later.

610
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,460
Theo, you're home.

611
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,060
Have you eaten? Are you hungry?

612
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,790
No.

613
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,560
Saifa treated me to dinner.

614
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,680
Did he share the song with you?

615
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,280
Do you like it?

616
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,880
I think he's so good.

617
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,060
The melodies are so nice and addictive.

618
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,780
Why will you stop
running your music company?

619
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,070
Saifa…

620
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,030
heard your employees talk about it.

621
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,870
Is this something you are hiding from me?

622
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,910
I'm done with it, Theo.

623
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,210
I want to do something else.

624
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,600
Does Dad know about this?

625
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,340
What did he say?

626
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,760
I remember you started this company

627
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,930
because Dad said
you had a gift for music.

628
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,310
You did it partly
because of Dad, didn't you?

629
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,050
Yes,

630
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,060
because of your dad.

631
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,630
And where are you going?

632
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,090
Theo,

633
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,800
where are you going?

634
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,940
Hey, not so fast.

635
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,340
My parents split up.

636
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,790
Mom.

637
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,900
We broke up

638
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,890
before you moved back home.

639
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,320
When we knew you'd come home,

640
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,920
I was the one who
wanted to hide it from you.

641
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,490
I was afriad you'd be upset.

642
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,850
So I asked your
dad to stay here with him

643
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,040
to make you happy.

644
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,800
I was thinking of telling you
the truth after your graduation.

645
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,890
But it was me again.

646
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,260
I can't put up with this anymore.

647
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,800
I can't stay here any longer.

648
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,740
Why?

649
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,270
Don't you love Dad anymore?

650
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,740
Mom?

651
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,390
I love you, Theo.

652
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,040
Very much.

653
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,700
Why?

654
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,280
Why did they do this?

655
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,510
Didn't they love each other so much?

656
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,230
Hey.

657
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,010
Enough.

658
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,000
Drink until you get stoned
and things won't change.

659
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
Why don't you seem surprised at all?

660
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,360
Will anything change if I act surprised?

661
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,610
You knew about this, didn't you?

662
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,690
Yes, I did.

663
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,700
You did.

664
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,190
You knew it all along

665
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,260
but you didn't think
you should at least tell me.

666
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,550
There.

667
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,780
Here we go.

668
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,400
You knew everything

669
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,880
and you let me be an idiot who
thought his parents were still in love.

670
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,760
Theo, listen.

671
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,380
I didn't think you were an idiot.

672
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,320
I just wanted you to be happy.

673
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,300
What happy?

674
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,240
I don't have either mom or dad.

675
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,740
I'm in need of this more than anyone.

676
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,220
You're lucky they both love you.

677
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,370
They reunited in order to provide
you with the perfect family you wanted.

678
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,470
Why is everyone lying to me?

679
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,320
Everyone.

680
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,240
You,

681
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,840
Dad, and Mom.

682
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,360
Why did everyone I love lie to me?

683
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,080
I didn't want to lie to you.

684
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,610
But I'm an outsider.

685
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,120
Who am I to say anything, Theo?

686
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,890
You could just tell the truth, Akk.

687
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,560
How can I believe
anything you say from now on?

688
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,990
Do you think I didn't feel bad
helping your parents hide it from you?

689
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,860
If you felt bad,
you should've told the truth.

690
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,030
If I made you feel bad,

691
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,870
I'm sorry.

692
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,200
You knew I'd find out someday

693
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,630
yet you chose to lie.

694
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,400
Don't say sorry.

695
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:01,800
I won't take it.

696
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,330
You're being unreasonable.

697
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,590
Hello, Sun.

698
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,800
Are you already in bed?

699
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,640
Not yet.

700
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm just thinking about things.

701
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,440
How have you been, Sun?

702
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,420
We haven't talked for so long.

703
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,740
Busy with documents
used to travel back to Thailand.

704
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,190
You're coming back?

705
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:49,880
When?

706
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,840
Come out front, Theo.

707
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:15,960
Sun.

708
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,730
Long time no see.

709
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,190
I want to have great
love like my parents did.

710
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,760
Do you really think so?

711
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,060
I don’t know if I can
have faith in love anymore.

712
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,190
Of course, you can.

713
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,150
You have me who love you.

714
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,560
You will always have
me by your side, Theo.
