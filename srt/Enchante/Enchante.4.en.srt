1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,690
Why did you choose Literature Major?

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,270
Do you know that Literature Major might get phased out next year?

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,340
I will make Literature Major great again.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,810
How about you do some PR work,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,040
like using the ambassadors to attract people to join the event?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Finish the whole bucket and I will help.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,290
Theo, are you lost again?

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,500
You puppy dog.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
You are so damn nosy.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,310
Without you, I still have Enchanté.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,310
[You can call me Enchanté.]

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,330
[Whenever you’re bored, you can just talk to me.]

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,100
If you want to know that bad, I’ll help you look for that Te-Te person of yours.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,580
Enchanté, if you really are a friend, meet me at the library right at noon.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,000
I said stop.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,790
What now?

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,050
This is too much.

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,220
Akk, hand them over.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,440
If we do this, we will get to meet the person in no time.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,300
You only need to be there at the appointed hour.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,330
If this Te-Te guy is real, he will show up.

22
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,360
It's me.

23
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,070
I'm Enchanté.

24
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,340
What the heck?

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Those four guys are
that Te-Te guy of yours?

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,520
They can't be.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
Enchanté must
be just one person.

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,470
One of them.

29
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,880
How can you be sure?

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,700
They might not be Enchanté at all.

31
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,510
You're right.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Why would they lie to me?

33
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,600
They even know French.

34
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,970
France?

35
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,550
Can it be like this?

36
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,870
I'm looking for a university scholarship
that matches my intellectual ability.

37
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,580
Will you be able to assist me in
obtaining an Oxford scholarship, Theo?

38
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,100
Oxford?

39
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,570
It's in England.

40
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,790
I'd like to exhibit my
beautiful painting at the...

41
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,210
Louk Museum?

42
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,180
Lark?

43
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,930
The giant pyramid.

44
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,790
Lork?

45
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,280
Louvre.

46
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,440
Yeah, that one.

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,960
Would you take me to show Didier
Deschamps my outstanding athletic skills

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,860
so that I can play in Ligue 1?

49
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,780
Poppycock.

50
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,010
You meant Wayo?

51
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,060
I meant you!

52
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,450
You need to hear
from the last one.

53
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't want anything much.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,150
I want to just perform an opera
on the top of the Eiffel Tower.

55
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,050
I'd like to grow my fan base into Paris.

56
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,240
If he likes opera, he better go to Italy.

57
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,780
Come on. I've never
traveled beyond the country.

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,170
You should take me so I can see
how wonderful your beloved France is.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,430
But I won't bother your time
with the Te-Te guy. I can guarantee that.

60
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,470
Want to go to France?

61
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,620
Take a photo with that thing for now.

62
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,170
Hey, where are you going?

63
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,260
Should we book the tickets now?

64
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,650
Wait!

65
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,030
You should've thought before
you did it. Please remove them all.

66
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,050
They're gonna leave the glue.

68
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,380
That's it.

69
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,700
Remove the glue too.

70
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,830
Of course.

71
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,460
You posted them everywhere.
Please think about people who clean after you.

72
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,070
It's good to get rid of them.

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,100
So no more people can claim to be me.

74
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Are you really Enchanté?

75
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Why did you ask me that?

76
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,280
You don't seem to like Theo that much.

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,090
You might be just fooling him.

78
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm not fooling him.

79
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,950
I really am Enchanté.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,970
Please continue.

81
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,290
Of course.

82
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,770
[Akk: I took them all down.]

83
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,150
[Akk: Now you can stop whining.]

84
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,900
[Akk: little bro Theo]

85
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,580
[Theo: Good.]

86
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,190
[Theo: I'm home already.]

87
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,980
The music video of Primmy's new song,

88
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,880
recheck the release date for me.

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,970
Sure. Give me a call if there's anything.

90
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,860
You've been busy lately, right?

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,750
It's normal for a new music company.

92
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm blessed enough to have
time to dine with our son.

93
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,910
Theo, about the Literature Major…

94
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,920
I already have an idea.

95
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm holding Zine Fair.

96
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,300
It's like a handmade book fair.

97
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,980
We will exchange books to
read, repair old books,

98
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,400
and discuss literature.

99
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,330
People can talk about
books they're interested in.

100
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,530
I think people who love to
read should like this event.

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,560
But I think it might be
a waste of your time.

102
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm not discouraging you.

103
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,200
But people don't read books anymore.

104
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,580
Many book publishers, newspapers,
and magazines shut themselves down.

105
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,680
People read news on social media these days.

106
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,850
But I believe there are still those
who enjoy reading, just like myself.

107
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,370
Feeling each page with the tip
of your fingers is not the same as
tapping your fingers on a smartphone.

108
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,700
All right.

109
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,980
You can try.

110
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,660
But if it doesn't
turn out the way you expect,

111
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,290
you must accept it, okay?

112
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,660
Hello, Theo.

113
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,460
Are you home yet?

114
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,550
Yes, I'm in my room.

115
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,990
Where are you?

116
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,750
You're there.
Why don't you turn the light on?

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,220
What are you up to?

118
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,690
Watching porn?

119
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,430
I'm pissed.

120
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,940
So you called me
here to be your punching bag?

121
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,090
What's up with you?

122
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,670
My dad,

123
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
he doesn't seem to trust me.

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,180
Come on.

125
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,610
Just think about what you're doing.

126
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,500
You're going against the
current of people around the world.

127
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,900
Do you think you can make it?

128
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
You also think I can't make it, don't you?

129
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
To be honest,

130
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,980
it's pretty tough.

131
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,960
Hey!

132
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,990
But I heard people
say nothing is impossible.

133
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,980
If you can make the Literature Major
popular and the banishment order is lifted,

134
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,740
I'll stop calling you little bro
Theo for the rest of my life.

135
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,600
That's a deal?

136
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,330
Yes.

137
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,350
Are you afraid, little bro Theo?

138
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,100
If you are, go drink some milk
and get some sleep, little bro Theo.

139
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,450
Little bro, my ass.

140
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,390
I'm not afraid.

141
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,670
Why so harsh?

142
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,380
Theo!

143
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,140
Little bro, huh?

144
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,320
Are you that serious?

145
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,600
Little bro, huh?

146
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
You can do it, Theo.

147
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,310
Why did you guys tell
Theo that you're Enchanté?

148
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,300
I should ask you the same question.

149
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,470
Liars know what the truth is.

150
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Theo,

151
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,930
who do you believe?

152
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,300
I don't want to talk about this right now.

153
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,890
I want to focus on Zine Fair.

154
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,870
If you all really want to help me,
how about we start with the preparations?

155
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,080
Let's not waste more time.

156
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,710
TWO HOURS EARLIER

157
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,190
Can you help me
figure out about Enchanté?

158
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,010
How do I know which
one is the real Enchanté?

159
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,330
You're so obsessed.

160
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,480
It's you who started this mess.

161
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,320
So it's my fault?

162
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,930
Sure, sir.

163
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,460
It is my fault.

164
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't be so furious.

165
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,220
[You can call me Enchanté.]
[Whenever you're bored, you can just talk to me. - Enchanté]

166
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,980
It's easy.

167
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,380
We should just compare
their handwriting to the one in this book.

168
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,370
Handwriting?

169
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,500
But people don't
write that much anymore.

170
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,540
They text or message online.

171
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,160
Even when they write,
they use tablets.

172
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,910
Phupha, for example.

173
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,690
Then we need to steal his tablet.

174
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,240
Do it yourself.

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,680
I can get arrested for that.

176
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,480
It's your idea. You do it.

177
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,720
It has to always be me, right?

178
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,740
I got an idea.

179
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,900
First of all, you need to get all of them here.

180
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:33,700
(And don't forget, besides looking for Te-Te,
you need to work on your book event as well.)

181
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,660
(Talk to them about Zine Fair.
Assign them the work.)

182
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,500
I'd like you to
recommend books at the event.

183
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,270
The ambassadors can
make the event more interesting

184
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,150
and that might
persuade more people to read.

185
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,190
Okay. I get it.

186
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,190
Would you excuse me?
I have football practice.

187
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,600
Don't mind him.

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,900
Apart from book recommendations,
do you need anything else?

189
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,270
If you can show your skills,
that'd be great.

190
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,530
I will write a new song.

191
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,810
Thank you.

192
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,640
So I need to draw, don't I?

193
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,540
Can you design
the event logo instead?

194
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,690
Well…

195
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,920
I will try.

196
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,130
Okay. I'm sure your
event will turn out great.

197
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,120
Thank you.

198
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,070
Wayo left and now
we have only three.

199
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,750
What should we do?

200
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,090
No worries.

201
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,000
Try to get the handwriting
from those three first.

202
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,020
How?

203
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,410
Guys, it's lunchtime.

204
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,000
How about we order
something to eat?

205
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,920
Stir-Fried Beef Basil with Fried Egg.

206
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,660
Same for me.

207
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,930
Me too.

208
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,360
Make that three.

209
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,510
How was it, dear friend?

210
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,500
Your clever plan failed
so bad just like I imagined.

211
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,120
Hey, at least I got
Phupha's handwriting.

212
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,490
They're different.

213
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,150
Natee, can you
specify the size for me?

214
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,910
His handwriting is pretty messy.

215
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,440
One more down.

216
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,640
Theo,

217
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,770
are you here asking for my help?

218
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,200
I'd like to have your name.

219
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,630
My name is on that sign.

220
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,570
I want the English version

221
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Hey, watch it!

222
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,740
Sorry, I lost control of the ball.

223
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,060
Never mind then.

224
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Saifa, hi.

225
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,170
Are you playing guitar?

226
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Can you play
something else as well?

227
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm a drummer too.

228
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,640
I've always wondered
what this thing is for.

229
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,530
It's to adjust the strings.

230
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,710
I should get to class now. See you.

231
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,720
Wait.

232
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,450
What is your friend
looking for in my bag?

233
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,990
Akk, I'm hungry.

234
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,730
Let's go get something to eat.

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,490
Sure. Bye, Saifa.

236
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,480
Bye.

237
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,170
Non of the three has
Enchanté's handwriting.

238
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,550
The last one has lost
the ability to write for now.

239
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,280
We've done so much yet
we still don't know who it is.

240
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,650
Fine. I surrender.

241
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,200
No more plans.

242
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,620
Just write down
and ask Te-Te who he is.

243
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,480
He might be tired of hiding already
and want to show himself.

244
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,530
Then things will be over.

245
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,570
[There are 4 Enchantés.]

246
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:25,260
[Who exactly are you?]

247
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,910
Now we just wait to
get the answer from Te.

248
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Come on. Bring it.

249
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,810
Bring it!

250
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,960
ça va?

251
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,700
ça va?

252
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,230
I can't see your face, Sun.

253
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,770
I'm cooking.
Can't hold the phone properly.

254
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,260
How are you?
Have you been well-adjusted?

255
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,570
No.

256
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,260
There are many culture shocks.

257
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,460
Stay a bit longer
and you'll be used to it.

258
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,090
I just thought about you
today and now you're calling.

259
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,450
I have so many things to tell you.

260
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,930
About what? Do tell.

261
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,210
It might sound weird, Sun

262
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,100
but please hear the whole story.

263
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,350
There are 4 guys approaching me.

264
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
There are older
students in the university.

265
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,580
All of them claimed to
be someone I want to meet,

266
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,720
but actually, there's just
one person I want to meet.

267
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,900
I have no idea why they did that.

268
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,140
What do you think I should do?

269
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Hello, Sun. Are you listening?

270
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,150
I am.

271
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,850
I'm trying to
get the answer for you.

272
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,290
I think you should find
the one you want to meet.

273
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,090
As for why they're approaching you,
I do have an answer.

274
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,620
Why?

275
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,800
Because you're interesting.

276
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,230
It's not strange people
want to get close to you.

277
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,950
I also miss you and want to go see you.

278
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,530
I'll try to believe that.

279
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
Wondering who's he talking to.

280
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,770
When did you get in here?

281
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,120
He's talking and smiling.

282
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,570
So in a good mood.

283
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,650
Why didn't you knock?

284
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,030
If I did, I wouldn't get to see you
peeping through his window.

285
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,880
I'm not. I'm drying my hair.

286
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,330
I'm not judging you.

287
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,190
I'm here to introduce a product.

288
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
A binocular!

289
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,860
Peep all you want. See what you wish.
Whatever it is, it'll be right in front of you.

290
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,750
Order now and
you'll get a discount, customer.

291
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,820
You're a great merchant just like Im.

292
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,860
Do you want one now, customer?

293
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,440
Just go to bed. You're still a kid.

294
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,360
I'll just leave it here.
When you decide to use it, pay me.

295
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,430
Bye.

296
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,240
Let me help.

297
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Here. You go first.

298
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,800
These are heavy.

299
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,280
Let me help.

300
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,120
That's fine.

301
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
Let go.

302
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,440
Thank you.

303
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Add some more.

304
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,560
I can take more.

305
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,800
Let's get some.

306
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,560
Is your hand okay now?

307
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,620
It is.

308
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,060
I'm a sportsman.

309
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,670
Why do you ask?

310
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,330
Worried about me?

311
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,370
Be careful.

312
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,840
So I'll put them in the activity area.

313
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,990
Yes.

314
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Let's go, guys.

315
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,750
How can he carry all that?

316
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,480
Five sticks are
already heavy for me.

317
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,930
There are lots of people.

318
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,260
Why carrying them all by himself?

319
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,310
He's a show-off.

320
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Akk, I heard that.

321
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,180
Sorry.

322
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,190
Just shut up.

323
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,930
You're lucky he doesn't
hit you with a wood stick.

324
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,910
Back to work.

325
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,770
Please visit Zine Fair.

326
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,670
Stop already.

327
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,350
I don't like being in photos.

328
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,490
I told you to
take pictures of the fair.

329
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,190
Your memory card might
be full of my pictures by now.

330
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,030
I never press the shutter button.

331
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,830
I know you don't like it.
I was just teasing you.

332
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,330
Here.

333
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,930
Thank you.

334
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,460
Here. Take it.

335
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,580
No. You have it.

336
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,230
You drink and refresh yourself.

337
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,680
You've been working all day.
You drink it.

338
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,750
You have, too.

339
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,700
Just drink.

340
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,500
Hey, guys.

341
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,480
I'll go get one more for you.

342
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,220
You just wanted to bicker.

343
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,750
It's your way of slacking off, right?

344
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,660
Go to the stage.
The event is about to start.

345
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,030
And get some photos.

346
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,920
Fine.

347
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,020
But before I go, can I get one photo?

348
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,270
You look really funny.

349
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,880
Asshole, delete it immediately!

350
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm gonna go take photos at the stage.

351
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,890
I don't want to miss the fun.

352
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,400
Akk, delete it first.

353
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,330
I won't.

354
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Hi, guys.

355
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,190
Welcome to the Literature
Major's first Zine Fair.

356
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,810
I believe many of you have
looked around the fair already.

357
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,170
We also have the university
ambassadors joining us in this event.

358
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,780
Please welcome the four
Nawawiwat University ambassadors.

359
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,030
Let's start with Phupha.

360
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,860
He's the top scholar student
who is academically excellent.

361
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,310
Natee is up next.

362
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,780
He is the president of the Art Club.

363
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,450
He's an artist who expresses
his work through lines and colors.

364
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,390
Please welcome.

365
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,800
Should we meet the next one?

366
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,540
This is Wayo,

367
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
the captain of the University Football Team.

368
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:01,840
He was the man who led the Nawawiwat Football
Team to two consecutive championships.

369
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,510
And here comes the last one.

370
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,150
Please welcome Saifa,

371
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
a musician with an angelic voice.

372
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,400
He is unquestionably popular among girls.

373
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,240
Welcome.

374
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,990
Hello, all Zine Fair attendees.

375
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,410
I never thought we'd get this
much support from so many people.

376
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,670
We all know how little we value
books in this age of technology.

377
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,960
Now when we read or write something,

378
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,750
we don't get many chances to
feel the paper and ink like before.

379
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,750
So this event will take
you back to your childhood,

380
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,440
the day we all
liked different kinds of books.

381
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,010
When I was young,

382
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,940
I loved reading adventure books.

383
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,010
Whether it takes me across lakes,
forests, mountains, or deserts,

384
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,610
I must find that ancient piece of art.

385
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,280
An adventure through a book is not
different than exploring this massive world.

386
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,440
Natee, do you have any
books you'd like to recommend to us?

387
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,850
Humans are like books.

388
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,550
We are fun, exciting, and mysterious.

389
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,820
I like psychology books,

390
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,180
as well as crime fiction.

391
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,830
You're so deep.

392
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I love mysteries.

393
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
It's a murder case in a locked room.

394
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,910
The murderer is among us.

395
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,930
Guys, please calm.

396
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,460
Step back a little.

397
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,140
Thank you.

398
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,750
Let's move on to the next ambassador.

399
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,990
Our cool athlete Wayo.

400
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,650
As for me,

401
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,920
I like books that talk about friendship,

402
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,720
the united efforts to create harmony.

403
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,280
It's just the most beautiful thing.

404
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,000
I have my pals and
my duty is to protect them.

405
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,690
It's such a great book
that demonstrates friendship.

406
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,060
Right, guys?

407
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,430
Right.

408
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,160
Now we've reached the last one,

409
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,980
our beloved
musician of this university.

410
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,450
Saifa.

411
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm not here to
recommend books or songs.

412
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,540
I just want to take you
back to your childhood.

413
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,640
It's so difficult to find
anything today, Grandma.

414
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,910
We've been walking all day and
haven't found anything to eat.

415
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,270
Grandpa, just be a bit more patient.

416
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,580
There must be something we can eat.

417
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,820
And that was the first time Momotaro
saw happiness on people's faces.

418
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:11,540
Just like when I saw my mother's
smile when she read me a bedtime story.

419
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,520
Why are we all quiet?

420
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,050
Give him a round of applause.

421
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,160
Thanks to everyone for coming.

422
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,550
I hope you enjoy this Zine Fair.

423
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,320
Please don't forget to stop by all
of the booths we have set up for you.

424
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
What are you doing here?

425
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,900
Did you record any video?
We might need it later.

426
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,870
No.

427
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,510
Why not?

428
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,140
It's battery and memory-consuming.

429
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,670
Pictures are enough.

430
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,850
The event holder,
don't you want to go up on stage?

431
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,740
I will just stay here.

432
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,590
I want everyone to own this event.

433
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Theo, you're…

434
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,690
interesting.

435
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,660
How?

436
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,250
People who work
always want some credit.

437
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,550
No one refuses to take it.

438
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,020
I hold this fair to encourage
people to love reading once again,

439
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,740
and take an
interest in the Literature Major.

440
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,640
Getting this much support from people

441
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,350
is considered my credit.

442
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,020
You're indeed interesting.

443
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,630
Excuse me. I'm visiting some other booths.

444
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,760
Get closer, guys.

445
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,450
Let's hear a very nice song from Saifa.

446
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,860
I wrote this song
specifically for this event.

447
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,350
It's for people who are in love,

448
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,180
like Theo.

449
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,950
♪ Does it matter who
has a crush on you? ♪

450
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,350
♪ Just want you
to feel his best wishes ♪

451
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,620
♪ Does it matter
what his feeling is ♪

452
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,820
♪ Just want you to smile ♪

453
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:44,620
♪ Just a guy whose heart
flutters when he sees you ♪

454
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,480
That was totally beautiful.
Let's give him a big hand.

455
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:03,110
Those who want to take photos
with him, you have a chance now.

456
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,560
Step in.

457
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,110
Do you think the lyrics are weird?

458
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,490
Do you think…

459
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,820
he's implying he's the real Enchanté?

460
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,320
Right?

461
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,890
They all say the same thing.

462
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,290
Then who is the real one?

463
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,690
If you want to know, just ask.

464
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,930
If I do that, they will all say yes.

465
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,150
How do we prove that?

466
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,170
The one who can answer the last question
you wrote in the book is the right one.

467
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,170
So you can let go of those who are not.

468
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,540
Right.

469
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,290
You're smart.

470
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,740
Absolutely. I share the same level
of intelligence as Sherlock Holmes.

471
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
I shouldn't have complimented you at all.

472
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,580
Let's go and finally find out.

473
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,040
Can I have a word, please?

474
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,130
If you aren't going to say anything,
I'll leave then.

475
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,810
Hold up.

476
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,610
I have something for you.

477
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,830
How did you have it?

478
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Did you really write them?

479
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,710
If not me,
then who else would do that?

480
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
How can I know for
sure that you wrote them?

481
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,960
Your handwriting
isn't like Enchanté's.

482
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,090
You're quite skeptical.

483
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,790
[Who do you want me to be?
I can be anything for you. - Enchanté]

484
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,600
[Everyone wants to be…]

485
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,030
Exactly the same.

486
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,510
How many types of
handwriting do you have?

487
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,990
You saw the version in that
food ordering paper, right?

488
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,010
It was hot and I was in a hurry.

489
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,970
Though you hurried,
they should have looked a bit the same.

490
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,330
Ask me to write a hundred more times,

491
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,200
they will be just the same.

492
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,060
[Everyone wants to be…Enchanté.]

493
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,000
Is it now proven
that I'm the real Enchanté?

494
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Je m'appelle Phupha.

495
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,510
Enchanté

496
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,700
Nancy, can I get a picture
with all the staff of this fair?

497
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,220
A quick one.

498
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,580
Sure.

499
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,070
Akk.

500
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,390
Akk!

501
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,540
Come and take photos.

502
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,920
He wants a
group photo with the staff.

503
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,320
Sure.

504
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,730
Hurry up.

505
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Theo, don't run away.

506
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,730
Just talk to me.

507
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
I'm not running away.

508
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I just need time to process

509
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,130
that you're really Enchanté.

510
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,630
I get you, Theo.

511
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,130
When I first saw the book,
I didn't know who wrote in it.

512
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,250
I wrote back just for fun.

513
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,530
But when I came upon your leaflet
that said you're looking for Enchanté,

514
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
I was glad.

515
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,510
Glad?

516
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,520
Why?

517
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,730
Well…

518
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,050
I was glad it's you.

519
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,380
But I have no clue why the
other three claimed to be Enchanté too.

520
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Me neither.

521
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,870
I don't get why
they told me they're Enchanté.

522
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know what their purposes are.

523
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,080
That's why I needed to prove it to
you, so you don't get fooled by others.

524
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,660
So…

525
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
If you're Enchanté,

526
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,370
I don't think I
need to write anything else.

527
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Can I please have my book back?

528
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,440
It's better to let me keep it.

529
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,120
Just like you said,

530
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
the book isn't necessary anymore.

531
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,770
Besides,

532
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,540
the real guy is
standing right in front of you.

533
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
No more writing to each other.

534
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,070
You can just talk to me in person.

535
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,490
Then…

536
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,810
let's go take a photo.

537
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,150
Everyone is waiting.

538
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,410
Let me take you home this evening.

539
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,130
What?

540
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
I want to talk

541
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,740
and get to know you better.

542
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,540
You're already my peer mentor.

543
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Why do you need
to know more about me?

544
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,780
Probably…

545
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,970
the same reason why
Enchanté wanted to know you.

546
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,990
Enchanté's reason?

547
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
The reason is…

548
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
he likes you.

549
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,060
I like you, Theo.

550
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,030
Don’t you want to know
why I became Enchanté,

551
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,990
apart from the fact that I like you?

552
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,340
So he really is Enchanté?

553
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,720
Are you stressed out
about something else too?

554
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,510
He said he liked me.

555
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,250
Theo, stop.

556
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:45,870
Theo!

557
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,320
Just tell me honestly what you want.

558
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,000
The one who wants
something from Theo…

559
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,540
should be you.

560
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,810
So you think everyone approaching
me wants something from me?

561
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,090
That’s what you really think?

562
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,270
The Enchanté book?

563
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,540
How come you have it?

564
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,960
I know that Natee
isn’t the real Enchanté.

565
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,320
What the hell?

566
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,620
You guys are friends.
You don’t need to find anyone to blame.

567
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,910
It won’t kill you to apologize first.

568
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,020
Romantic movies are
always with kiss scenes.

569
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,390
People who aren’t in love
won’t kiss each other, right?

570
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,750
Do you want me to kiss you?
