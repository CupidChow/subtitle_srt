1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,760
Those four guys are that Te-Te guy of yours?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,460
They can’t be.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,910
Enchanté must be just one person.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,160
They might not be Enchanté at all.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,080
Theo, who do you believe?

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,460
I just want to focus on Zine Fair.

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,510
This song is for people who are in love,

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,920
like Theo.

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,690
Do you think the lyrics are weird?

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
Do you think he’s
implying he’s the real Enchanté?

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,680
Let me help.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,890
Is your hand okay now?

13
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,200
Worried about me?

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,250
Did you really write them?

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,520
If not me, then who else would do that?

16
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,300
Is it now proven that
I’m the real Enchanté?

17
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,000
Can I please have my book back?

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,400
It’s better to let me keep it.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,320
Why do you need
to know more about me?

20
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,720
Probably the same reason why
Enchanté wanted to know you.

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,480
Enchanté’s reason?

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,100
The reason is…

23
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,360
he likes you.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,600
Ready?

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,010
I get it.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,750
You might not
know how to react now.

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,690
I can wait.

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,060
Okay, guys. Thank you so much.

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,850
We're done here.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,440
Let's go now.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,340
What now?

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,350
Ask me later.

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,080
Get your stuff and go home.

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,610
Hey.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,300
You can see that he's running away.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
Do you still want to chase him?

37
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,580
It's none of your business.

38
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,870
Hmm.

39
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,980
You spoke very nicely when you
asked for my help with the fair.

40
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,990
Why are you like this now?

41
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,170
This is not cute at all,

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,610
Student Body President.

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,280
I don't know why you
told him you're Enchanté

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,560
but I'm telling you here,
what you're doing isn't gonna work.

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,420
If it is,

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,520
he wouldn't run away like that.

47
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,900
If you are meant to be,
you don't need to run after him.

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,590
He will come to you eventually.

49
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,270
Hey,

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
are you angry with someone?

51
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,430
I'm not.

52
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,090
I just want to workout.

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,270
It might help clear my head.

54
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,920
I don't want to talk about it now.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,050
Is it about Phupha?

56
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,360
Why?

57
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,830
What did he say to you?

58
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,740
So...

59
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,230
he really is Enchanté?

60
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm not sure about Enchanté.

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Are you stressed out
about something else too?

62
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,900
You can tell me.

63
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,190
He said he liked me.

64
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,990
He likes you?

65
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,000
Maybe he pretended to
be Enchanté because he likes you.

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,180
Why does he like you?

67
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,200
No idea.

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,640
Are you sure he approaches
because he truly likes you,

69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,490
not because he
wants something from you?

70
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,080
You're having a cynical view of him.

71
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,410
So you're protecting him now?

72
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,140
Why would I protect him?

73
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,290
I'm protecting myself.

74
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,540
You think everyone approaching
me wants something from me.

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Do you really think so?

76
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,330
I...

77
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,340
I don't know.

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,160
All I know is a perfect guy like
you should be a good match for him.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,910
Just say yes to him.

80
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,690
Why being irritated and
taking it all on me like this?

81
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,080
What the hell is wrong with you?

82
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,960
I'm tired.

83
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm going home and taking a shower.

84
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,070
Akk!

85
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,320
Isn't it me who feels frustrated here?

86
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,940
Why are you being like this?

87
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,680
Everything is about you.

88
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,100
Do you think the world
revolves around you?

89
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,350
Just go home

90
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,760
before I hit you in the face.

91
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,110
Sure.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
I am going.

93
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,120
So he really is Enchanté?

94
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm not sure about Enchanté.

95
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
He said he liked me.

96
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,620
Just say yes to him.

97
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,490
A perfect guy like you should
be a good match for him.

98
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,890
What the hell is wrong with you?

99
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,280
Theo.

100
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,960
Theo, stop.

101
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,900
Theo.

102
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,520
Theo, hold on.

103
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,680
Theo.

104
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,960
Theo.

105
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,840
Theo, stop the car.

106
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,510
Theo.

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
Theo.

108
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,230
Theo.

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,160
Theo.

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
You've been dragging
the bag strap along the way.

111
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,820
Let me try it.

112
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,310
Do you want to come?

113
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,660
Will you feel uncomfortable?

114
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,550
If you're uncomfortable, that's fine.

115
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,440
What are you doing, Theo?

116
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,880
Can I help you with anything today?

117
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,300
Aside from the ambassadors
going up on stage yesterday,

118
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,170
there's nothing else.

119
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,860
But...

120
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,500
I really want to assist.

121
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,400
I can buy you a drink or food.

122
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,290
Are you feeling stiff at all?

123
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,350
I am not.

124
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,270
My work here is done.

125
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,680
I'm going to check
on the other booths.

126
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,720
You're avoiding me.

127
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,630
Don't you want to know why I became
Enchanté, apart from the fact that I like you?

128
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,160
I'm all ears.

129
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,630
Why did you become Enchanté?

130
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,100
I...

131
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,450
I know how you feel, Theo.

132
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,600
You must be very lonely.

133
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,920
You suddenly had
to come back from France.

134
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,880
And you don't
have many friends here.

135
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,440
I just wanted to make
you feel like you're still there.

136
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,730
That's why I became
Enchanté and wrote you back.

137
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,960
And...

138
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,070
I don't want you to be alone.

139
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,420
I want to take care of you always.

140
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,260
Will you let me take care of you?

141
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,870
Hello.

142
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,350
Sure, I'll be right there.

143
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,280
Yes.

144
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,310
What...

145
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,270
Sorry. I wasn't looking.
Are you all right?

146
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,100
I am.

147
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,040
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,690
Sure.

149
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,580
Why are you
pretending to be Enchanté?

150
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,360
You're the one pretending.

151
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,540
I think you shoud stop.

152
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,360
Just tell me honestly...

153
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,490
what you want.

154
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,760
The one who
wants something from Theo...

155
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,150
should be you.

156
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm giving you a
chance to step away from Theo.

157
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,270
Otherwise,
I'll be the one exposing you.

158
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,970
Don't you threaten me.

159
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,650
I'm Enchanté.

160
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,830
You're the one
that should step away.

161
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,580
Do you want to
get your book repaired?

162
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,920
Any kind of book is welcomed.

163
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,180
Getting your book repaired?

164
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,230
I told you to take photos of the fair.

165
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,900
You, dickhead,
are taking pictures of a dog.

166
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,250
Hi. Do you need
to get your book repaired?

167
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,110
The Enchanté book?

168
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,880
How come you have it?

169
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,510
That's the
expense for this month.

170
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,510
I'll transfer the amount to you.

171
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,050
Shit.

172
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,520
Where is it?

173
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,940
It's supposed to be with Phupha.

174
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,120
It doesn't matter.

175
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,440
Enchanté should be able
to keep this book in a safe place.

176
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,240
Right?

177
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,280
Phupha is not Enchanté.

178
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,740
How do you know?

179
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,410
[...You can call me Enchanté.
You can call me Enchanté...]

180
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,870
Phupha practiced writing the
word Enchanté just to deceive you.

181
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,640
Why should I believe you?

182
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,800
Is it clear now?

183
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,790
Why did Phupha do that?

184
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,810
You said it yourself that
you didn't want to talk about
Enchanté until the Zine Fair is over.

185
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,180
I thought I'd
wait until this fair ended

186
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,130
but Phupha crossed the line.

187
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,210
That's why I need to tell you the truth.

188
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,220
He's using you.

189
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,160
Using me?

190
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,510
Do you know anything
about the university scholarship?

191
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,570
A little.

192
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,770
Phupha wants the scholarship.

193
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,560
Once he knew who you were,
he thought he could fool you into talking to
your father in order for him to get the scholarship

194
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,850
without him having to do anything.

195
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,180
Actually,
I hate to say this kind of thing.

196
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,670
I'm just worried about you.

197
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,850
I don't want you to get fooled.

198
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,820
And I don't want anyone
to use Enchanté stuff to trick you.

199
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,370
Then may I
please have my book back?

200
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,440
If you want
the Enchanté book back,

201
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,680
meet me at the Art Club
when the Zine Fair is over.

202
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,340
Okay.

203
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,740
This is for you.

204
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,460
Don't forget to come see me.

205
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,560
I have something to say to you.

206
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,870
Are you sure he approaches
because he truly likes you,

207
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,870
not because he
wants something from you?

208
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,330
You think everyone approaching
me wants something from me.

209
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,510
Do you really think so?

210
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,660
Hey.

211
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,910
Isn't there any
chamber available right now?

212
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,160
There isn't any.

213
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Whenever there is,
please let me know.

214
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,360
I really need to use a chamber.

215
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,360
Of course. I will surely let you know.

216
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,760
Hey.

217
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,350
Are you a friend of Natee?

218
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,000
Did he ask you to
steal the Enchanté book for him?

219
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,870
Sorry. I wasn't looking.

220
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,570
Are you all right?

221
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,640
I asked you the question.

222
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,040
Did you bump into me on
purpose to steal the book for him?

223
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,670
Where is Natee now?

224
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,380
Theo,

225
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,530
we need to talk.

226
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,230
I know you faked your
handwriting to match Enchanté's.

227
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,500
Why did you lie to me?

228
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,310
I'm sorry, Theo.

229
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,890
I didn't mean to deceive you.

230
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,230
I did all that because...

231
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,620
I wanted to know you

232
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,170
and to be close to you.

233
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,870
Are you sure?

234
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,150
I know

235
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,070
you approached me

236
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
because you're scared you
wouldn't get the scholarship.

237
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,980
Who told you that?

238
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,610
Was it Natee?

239
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,350
It doesn't matter.

240
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,640
The truth is now clear to me.

241
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,110
I didn't mean to fool you, Theo.

242
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,850
I am sorry.

243
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,650
Please hear me out.

244
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,830
I did it because my mom is sick.

245
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,300
Actually,

246
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,520
I hate my mother so much.

247
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,410
She's both a gambler and an alcoholic.

248
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
She kept spending all the money we had.

249
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,240
I never wanted to go home.

250
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,470
All I wanted was to move far away from her.

251
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,140
That's why I was trying to
get a scholarship to study abroad.

252
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,940
But one day,

253
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,950
my mom collapsed because of a stroke.

254
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,830
Mom!

255
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,530
Mom!

256
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,570
Mom!

257
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,570
Hello.

258
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,390
Is that a hospital?

259
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,580
Luckily, I sent her to a hospital in time.

260
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,180
If she wakes up one day
just to be the same person,

261
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,330
- If there's anything, please let me know.
- Thank you.

262
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,060
I won't be able to carry on.

263
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,900
The money I have left
won't cover the treatment

264
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,760
[Account Balance: 18,530 baht.]

265
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,730
and the household expenses.

266
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,880
I gave up some of my tuition
money for the treatment.

267
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,520
I was thinking of applying for a scholarship
to study abroad when she recovered.

268
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,520
It's when I learned that
you're the university owner's son.

269
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,250
It'd be great if I got to know you.

270
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,070
It's a coincidence you
happen to be my peer mentee.

271
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,560
So I thought if I could be Enchanté,
I'd get a chance to talk to you more.

272
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,700
I might ask you to talk to your father to
consider giving me a scholarship in France.

273
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,980
That way I can go as far
away from my mom as possible.

274
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,830
I hate your method

275
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,360
but I kind of get you.

276
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,640
Does it mean I'm forgiven?

277
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,660
But I can't trust
you like I did before.

278
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,720
I don't like people who use me

279
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,790
and people who aren't honest.

280
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,810
But I'm honest now.

281
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,000
I really like you, Theo.

282
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,440
Stop it already.

283
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,390
Quit fooling me.

284
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,820
Theo,

285
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I promise I won't lie to you ever again.

286
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,490
And I won't let
anyone else lie to you either.

287
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,230
So there are
other people lying to me too?

288
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,210
Is the Enchanté
book with Natee now?

289
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,560
He stole it from me.

290
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,290
I also know that
Natee isn't the real Enchanté.

291
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,560
That's enough.

292
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,070
Aren't you tired?

293
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,560
Wow,

294
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,600
aren't you two going to wait for me?

295
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,100
You're late. Why should we wait?

296
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,020
We're starving, hey!

297
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,080
You're gross, Akk.

298
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,460
You haven't washed your hands.
Not hygienic.

299
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,660
Get this.

300
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,980
Ouch! Don't!

301
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,230
Hey,

302
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,390
quit bugging her.

303
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,580
Ask Theo to join us for dinner.

304
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,580
I cooked a lot of Khai Palo.

305
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,840
It's his favorite, right?

306
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,880
Don't ask him.

307
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,090
Why should we?

308
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,410
You two are always
together like Siamese twins.

309
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,530
What now?

310
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,000
Having a fight?

311
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,780
No.

312
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,120
Judging from your voice,
you two are definitely fighting.

313
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,390
We're not fighting.

314
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:23,080
I know Theo didn't
pick you up this morning.

315
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,610
If things were cool between
you two, Theo wouldn't do that.

316
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,220
He was being lunatic.

317
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,580
He was mad at me for no reason.

318
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,720
It's nonsense.

319
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
If he's mad, you can just apologize.

320
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,150
Big sis, it's not my fault.

321
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,280
Why should I apologize?

322
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,110
You guys are friends.
You don't need to find anyone to blame.

323
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
It won't kill you to apologize first.

324
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,100
Being mad at each other
is a waste of good time together.

325
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,370
Do you want
things to be like that?

326
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,260
The more I clean it up,
the messier it gets.

327
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,530
Done, finally.

328
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,270
What are you doing?

329
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,930
What brings you here?

330
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,750
You weren't home

331
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,260
so I came back to check in on you.

332
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,560
Why are you here?

333
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,100
My sister made Khai Palo.

334
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,270
She asked me to give it to you.

335
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,800
That's all?

336
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,930
Yes,

337
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,200
that's all.

338
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,540
You want it or not?

339
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,760
What are you doing?

340
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,760
Just take it already so I can leave.

341
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,870
Don't use Khai Palo as an excuse.

342
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,180
I know you came to see me.

343
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,330
What the heck are you saying?

344
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,030
Im told me to bring it to you.

345
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,090
Someone like you
doesn't follow anyone's orders.

346
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,910
Do you think I'll believe you?

347
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,830
That's up to you.

348
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,890
No food for you then.

349
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,170
Just give it to me.

350
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,030
Why playing hard to get?

351
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,930
By the way,

352
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,500
what are you doing here all alone?

353
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,750
It's Natee.

354
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,920
Take back your rose

355
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
and give me back my book.

356
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,860
When I give anyone anything,

357
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,190
I don't take it back.

358
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,210
And if you throw away my rose,

359
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,210
you'll never get your book back.

360
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,080
What do you want from me?

361
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,780
You seem to want
your book back so badly.

362
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,750
Enchanté must be
very important to you, right?

363
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,330
Give it to me already.

364
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,300
Here.

365
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,640
Hold up.

366
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,820
I already know who Enchanté is.

367
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,210
Tell me then.

368
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,680
I can but you must help me first.

369
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,070
Help what now?

370
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,710
Find me a chamber
for an art exhibition.

371
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,110
I really need to
showcase all the artwork.

372
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,040
I don't think that's
difficult for someone like you.

373
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,770
Why do I need to do that for you?

374
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,230
In exchange for the answer.

375
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,000
You'll know who Enchanté is.

376
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,140
If you don't want to know, it's fine.

377
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,100
When do you need the chamber?

378
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
So Natee really knows?

379
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,050
I have no idea.

380
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,550
I'm here because
I want to know the truth.

381
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,950
From what he said,
he isn't the real Enchanté.

382
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,270
He might be implying that it's himself,

383
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,640
Wayo,

384
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,660
or Saifa.

385
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,900
Or none of them.

386
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,100
Why do you think so?

387
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,610
It's just a possibility.

388
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,840
That's true.

389
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,280
But I still want to know.

390
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,700
If you want to know that bad,

391
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,020
I'll help you find him.

392
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,830
We will know who the real one is.

393
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,930
I'm sorry.

394
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,830
This room is full of dust.

395
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,500
Don't scratch it.

396
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,580
You always scratch it
when you have a dust allergy.

397
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,820
It's itchy.

398
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,280
Don't scratch.

399
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,120
What are you doing?

400
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,930
What are you doing, Akk?

401
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,980
Be still.

402
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,460
What are you doing?

403
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,390
What is it?

404
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,130
What is this?

405
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,150
You're hurting me.

406
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:38,890
Akk,

407
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,580
wait.

408
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,660
hold on.

409
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,510
Stay put.

410
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,200
Akk,

411
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,900
it hurts.

412
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,210
Just put up with it.

413
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,220
When you stop feeling scratchy,

414
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,470
I'll untie you.

415
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,930
You tied me so tight.

416
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,690
How can I eat?

417
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,480
That's not a problem.

418
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,430
Yum, yum!

419
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,820
You're such a pain.

420
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,630
Just eat, little bro Theo.

421
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,930
Yum, yum!

422
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,230
Yum.

423
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Yum.

424
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,300
What a rich kid.

425
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
You're just allergic to everything.

426
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,240
It doesn't have anything
to do with being a rich kid.

427
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,750
It's an allergic reaction.

428
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,770
Anyone can have that.

429
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,470
Why do you like to snap at me so much?

430
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,720
I don't mean to snap

431
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,660
or yell at you at all.

432
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,170
I never do.

433
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,230
You know I'm foul-mouthed.

434
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,910
I am sorry.

435
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,670
Forget it.

436
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,360
I know you're foul-mouthed.

437
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,100
Actually,
you're a dog that always barks.

438
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,950
I saw you talking to a dog today.

439
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,750
You did?

440
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,630
Then will you
please let this dog feed you?

441
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,020
Yum, yum.

442
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,860
I want more.

443
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,770
Can I have one more egg?

444
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,370
Right away.

445
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,380
Aren't you gonna eat?

446
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,330
No.

447
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,220
I'm here to take care of you.

448
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,360
Yum, yum.

449
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,830
I'm okay now.

450
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,350
Thank you so much.

451
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,690
It's good then.

452
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,060
Hey,

453
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,800
how can it survive in this room?

454
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,410
A rose is a living organism.

455
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,230
It has to strive for survival.

456
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,180
Through a crack of concrete,

457
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,250
grasses can manage to grow.

458
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,390
You're right.

459
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,180
Damn!

460
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,120
What is it?

461
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,600
This.

462
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,890
This movie is freakin' great.

463
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm sure you'll love it.

464
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,760
Are you going to watch it now?

465
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,100
Is this projector still working?

466
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,200
We might have to test it.

467
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,920
You said we should just test it.

468
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,180
But this looks quite serious.

469
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,470
Come on.

470
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,900
It's once in a while.

471
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,900
I haven't watched
any movies in a long time.

472
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,930
Me neither.

473
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,050
Crisp crisp, huh?

474
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,590
You're too much.

475
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,000
When was the last time you
watched a movie in a theater?

476
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,070
Don't remember.

477
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,130
Forever ago.

478
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,020
When is your favorite movie time,
the one you'll never forget?

479
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,690
Maybe it's when my parents
took me to a movie for the first time.

480
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,810
You know, the movie
didn't make sense to me at all.

481
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,640
Didn't make sense, but why is
it your favorite movie moment?

482
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,930
Because it didn't make sense to me,
I had a chance to look around.

483
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,000
I was sitting in the middle
seat between mom and dad.

484
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,760
They would feed each
other popcorn all the time.

485
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,230
Think about it.

486
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,920
They are still like that up until now.

487
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,790
Why do they love each other so much?

488
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,880
Shit. What's happening?

489
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,750
I guess the DVD is too old.

490
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,990
Damn!

491
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,160
It gets stuck.

492
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,080
What's happening next?

493
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,630
It's starting to get really good.

494
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,950
Should I tell you the story?

495
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,360
Yeah, go on.

496
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,780
Do the male and female
leads get together in the end?

497
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,660
What's their relationship?

498
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,480
They get stuck in the friendzone.

499
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,870
They have a good
feeling towards each other.

500
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,520
They just don't know what exactly it is.

501
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,940
They enjoy challenging and
daring one another to do something.

502
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,720
Are you lying?

503
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,040
I'm telling the truth.

504
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,420
What are their challenges?

505
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,750
It starts with something simple,

506
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,080
such as doing something embarrassing.

507
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,360
They see whether they
have the courage to hold hands

508
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,420
or hug.

509
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,030
The challenges continue.

510
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,390
They finally question if
they dare to kiss each other.

511
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,490
Let me guess.

512
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,430
They do it.

513
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,590
Why do you think so?

514
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,010
Two reasons.

515
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:10,720
They do it because deep down,
they like each other.

516
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,770
Or they do it because
they don't feel anything at all.

517
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,790
They just want to win.

518
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,760
Am I right?

519
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,380
Yeah.

520
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Romantic movies are
always with kiss scenes.

521
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,160
If they kiss because of love,
that's okay.

522
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,720
If not,

523
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,170
it should be hard.

524
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,590
People who aren't in love
won't kiss each other, right?

525
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,680
Why do you think it's hard?

526
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,840
Do you want me to kiss you?

527
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,670
What did you say?

528
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,780
I said do you
want me to try kissing you?

529
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,360
Akk!

530
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,640
You just challenged the wrong man.

531
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,330
You're all talk.

532
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,350
You won't dare.

533
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,060
What a chicken.

534
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,120
You can't do it.

535
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,540
You should practice harder, bro.

536
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
I came from France,

537
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,280
the land of French kisses.

538
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,470
You're weak.

539
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,420
I'm not.

540
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,980
I just wanted to watch the movie.

541
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,350
Theo.

542
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,910
Theo.

543
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,480
Did you just say I'm weak?

544
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,780
What’s wrong? Why are you so quiet?

545
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,170
My mom said she could tell right
away what he thinks of me.

546
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Just tell me who Enchanté is.

547
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,150
If you want to know,
come to my exhibition.

548
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,890
The answer you’re looking for is there.

549
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,260
I just had a weird dream.

550
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,990
Did I do anything in my sleep?

551
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,680
Are you really Enchanté?

552
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,500
So you’re admitting you’re not?

553
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,540
You’re not either.

554
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,420
How do you know that?

555
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,840
He draws so many pictures of me. I
s he a psychopathic stalker?

556
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,110
You know when I take interest in something,
I won’t back off so easily.
