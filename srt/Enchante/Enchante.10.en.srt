1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,290
Be my boyfriend?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,010
What is going on
between those two?

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,650
Theo is the center of attention.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,390
You're close to him. It's normal
for you to be the topic too.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,010
When are we going
to stop lying to Theo?

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,210
Is something wrong here?

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,960
We broke up before
you moved back home.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,150
You knew everything and
you let me be an idiot.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,900
I just wanted you to be happy.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,960
Sun.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,320
What's wrong?

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,980
Aren't you happy I'm here?

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,500
I am happy.

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,570
I've just got something on my mind.

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,410
Let me go say hi to
your mom and dad first.

16
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,720
None of them is here.

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,230
Is there something
you want to tell me?

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,120
This city has changed a lot.

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,140
It wasn't this bustling when I left.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,380
Didn't you experience any culture
shock when you first arrived here?

21
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,080
There were some.

22
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,280
I just tried to slowly adjust.

23
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,350
It's good you have
your parents to guide you.

24
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,060
I remember what your mom said
to me when she took you to Paris.

25
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,310
She said we're both from the
same country. I should look out for you.

26
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,960
I was afraid I'd have a negative
influence on you and she'd scold me.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,530
My parents split up.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
For a while.

29
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,990
Before I moved back here.

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,410
She wanted to tell
me after my graduation.

31
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,150
What a pity.

32
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,220
If my grandmother hadn't
passed and I hadn't moved back,

33
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,740
they wouldn't have
had to put up with this.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
This isn't something
you're to blame for.

35
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,700
I hate to think this way

36
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,180
but I feel betrayed.

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,970
Honestly, I don't believe they
fell out of love with each other.

38
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,560
What made you think so?

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,510
I don't think.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,430
I feel it.

41
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,430
They have always had
pure love for each other.

42
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,110
Ever since I was born,

43
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,620
I've never seen them fight before.

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,470
I want to love great love as they do.

45
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,720
Do you really think so?

46
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,540
Yes.

47
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,150
I want you to
prepare for disappointments.

48
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,990
By looking into their eyes,

49
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,570
I can tell they still love each other.

50
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,890
Maybe there's a way
to help them reconcile.

51
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,730
If you really believe they can
make their way back to each other,

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,030
I will help you.

53
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,890
Thank you so much.

54
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,890
You've been very helpful.

55
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,180
Maybe this is the
reason I come back.

56
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,430
To help you.

57
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,870
Because you're
my le Seigneur, right?

58
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,120
Yes?

59
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,900
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

60
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,530
I left my phone in the car.

61
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,470
Where are you now?

62
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,180
Home already.

63
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,640
Where have you been?

64
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,460
I gotta go.

65
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,820
My phone is dying.

66
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,040
Let's talk later.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,100
Welcome.
We have a promotion today.

68
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,540
If you take a
photo with the owner…

69
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,180
Krating,

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,770
take care of the customers.

71
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,200
Come on, Uncle.

72
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,890
Are you going to take
female customers only?

73
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,180
Please enjoy.

74
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,110
Cafés in Bangkok are
as good as those in Paris.

75
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,660
The staff here are friendlier
than some of them over there.

76
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,400
You said you found a
way to reconcile my parents.

77
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,400
Uh-huh.

78
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,430
How?

79
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,510
Do you remember this song?

80
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,200
I do.

81
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,350
The first Christmas in Paris,

82
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,410
my grandma invited you over.

83
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,650
You put this song on.

84
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,770
My grandma loved it very much.

85
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,270
Songs are time capsules, Theo.

86
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,060
Some songs recall the
special times in our lives.

87
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,830
Thank you.

88
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,040
Thanks a ton, Sun.

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,890
Treat me to bakeries in return.

90
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,530
Bye.

91
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,590
Who were you out with so early?

92
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,140
His name is Sun.

93
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,250
I met him in France.

94
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,900
He lived close by.

95
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,580
When I was there,

96
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,790
he always took care of me.

97
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,830
He seems to be a
very good caretaker.

98
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,160
Yes.

99
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,980
Without him,
my life would be miserable.

100
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,020
About my parents' breakup,

101
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,030
he tries to find a
way for reconciliation.

102
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,380
He's always been there for me.

103
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,530
Theo,

104
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,770
your parents made their choice.

105
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,510
You should respect their decision.

106
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,570
You hate it yourself when
they make you do things.

107
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
I just want to have a perfect family.

108
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
I want to see them being each
other's motivation once again.

109
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,160
I get it.

110
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,360
But they separated a long time ago.

111
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,840
They have their own path to walk.

112
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,620
You just need to live with the reality.

113
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,180
They separated
but they both love you.

114
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,680
I won't give up.

115
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,490
I will make them get back together.

116
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,750
I will do what Sun said.

117
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,150
And I won't give up
easily as you hope I will.

118
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,010
I was about to ask
Egg to get you here.

119
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,770
Let's eat.

120
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,440
Ask Theo to join us.

121
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,200
He won't come.

122
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,270
Why not?

123
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,870
He's busy

124
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,820
I'm not hungry.

125
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,130
I'm just gonna go.

126
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,330
What happened?

127
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,600
Why is he being weird?

128
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,710
Theo.

129
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,970
Your mom said you already know.

130
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,530
Yes, I do.

131
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,780
That's why I asked you two here.

132
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,330
Is there anything you
want to talk to us about?

133
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,490
I've got something to show you.

134
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,310
Do you guys remember this song?

135
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,050
We listened to it all
the time when I was little.

136
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,770
You always put it on when
we went to beaches, Dad.

137
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,770
I do remember.

138
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,060
I do too.

139
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,550
There's more.

140
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,950
I found your wedding video

141
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,680
and learned that it's the
song you used at your wedding.

142
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,830
I want you back together.

143
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,370
Theo.

144
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,840
Whatever misunderstandings you two have,

145
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,780
please patch things up.

146
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,240
I believe everything will get better.

147
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,920
What?

148
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,530
Only one day without water,
and you're like this already?

149
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,140
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,860
Don't die.

151
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Theo.

152
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,010
How did it go?

153
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,770
Did you do as I suggested?

154
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,590
I did.

155
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,040
Thank you so much for
doing this for us, Theo.

156
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,610
But we just can't get
back together for you.

157
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,910
Your mom and I
love you very much.

158
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,350
We will always be family.

159
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,870
The feeling, once it's ruined,

160
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
it can hardly be mended.

161
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm sorry I can't do this for you.

162
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,370
We're sorry.

163
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,180
Not all couples in real life end
up happily like in the novels, son.

164
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,340
We're sorry.

165
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,810
Do you still love me?

166
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
We do.

167
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,970
Very much so.

168
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,670
We do love you.

169
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,120
Their love has
really dried out, right?

170
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,770
But they still love you.

171
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,540
They will always be your family.

172
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,760
You know that, don't you?

173
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,840
Why doesn't he answer?

174
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,880
Theo doesn't answer your calls?

175
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,530
Right.

176
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,890
He probably went out
and forgot to bring his phone.

177
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,810
Don't think so.

178
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,710
Theo isn't forgetful.

179
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,360
Maybe he hasn't got up yet.

180
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
He's a morning person.

181
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,260
Sneak into his house then.

182
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,460
I'll be your lookout.

183
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,530
Are you crazy?

184
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm not a thief.

185
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,380
I'm just worried about him.

186
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,400
You barge into
his house all the time.

187
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,690
Why are you
being reluctant today?

188
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,100
Can I really go see him?

189
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,210
Of course.

190
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
If you want to, just move.

191
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,450
Quickly.

192
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,160
So you can see if he's home or not.

193
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,170
And you can stop
talking to yourself here.

194
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,950
Go.

195
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,580
Now.

196
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,370
Go. Go.

197
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,400
Move.

198
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,350
I'm his boyfriend.
I have nothing to be afraid of.

199
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,570
Theo.

200
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,300
Are you okay?

201
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,370
Theo is not feeling well.

202
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,720
Are you a friend of Theo?

203
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,280
He is.

204
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,490
He didn't sound well
over the phone yesterday

205
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,660
so I came by to see him.

206
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,330
And I found him sick.

207
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,290
Will you look after Theo then?

208
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,940
I have a video conference to get to.

209
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,950
Sun, you can go.

210
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,960
Don't worry.

211
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,250
Take care.

212
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Almost forgot.

213
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,810
Can you make him a
cup of Marco Polo tea?

214
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,650
I brought him from France.

215
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
He drinks this tea when he's sick.

216
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
It helps him feel better.

217
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,410
Sure.

218
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,980
You're sick.

219
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,730
Why didn't you tell me?

220
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,680
I called.

221
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,550
You didn't pick up.

222
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,850
My parents literally split up.

223
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
I should've listened to you.

224
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,360
I was stupid.

225
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,400
I was freaking stubborn.

226
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,250
You should take a rest.

227
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,090
You're sick.

228
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,430
People who love you are worried.

229
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,240
Can you make him a
cup of Marco Polo tea?

230
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,230
He drinks this tea when he's sick.

231
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,860
It helps him feel better.

232
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,820
Hey.

233
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,540
Theo.

234
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,060
Eat and take some medicines.

235
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,750
Not hungry.

236
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,190
But you must eat in
order to get better.

237
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,220
You still have this pillow with you?

238
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,700
Why?

239
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,720
It's my good childhood memory.

240
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,450
Was it really good?

241
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,700
I guess so.

242
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm so lost right now.

243
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,100
I feel like

244
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,610
nobody loves me anymore.

245
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,020
Both my parents left me here.

246
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,410
Don't say that.

247
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,760
They didn't leave you.

248
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,720
You know how much they love you.

249
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,560
But they don't
love each other anymore.

250
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,300
What I used to
believe about their love…

251
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
disappeared into thin air.

252
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,130
I don't know if I can
have faith in love anymore.

253
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,920
Of course, you can.

254
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,270
You have me who loves you.

255
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,550
You will always have
me by your side, Theo.

256
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,350
I thought you left.

257
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,750
I was just afraid you
would be uncomfortable.

258
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,260
I wouldn't leave you.

259
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,000
Hey,

260
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,230
slowly.

261
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,100
Are you feeling okay now?

262
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,020
I am.

263
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,390
What a relief.

264
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,770
Your fever is gone.

265
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,870
Thank you for keeping me company.

266
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,850
I'm not just your company.

267
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,330
I'm your boyfriend.

268
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,840
I was so worried, Theo.

269
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,760
Yes. I know.

270
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,090
Are you here to grab your stuff?

271
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,550
Yes.

272
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,380
I forgot something here.

273
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,630
The painting palette?

274
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,590
It's the only thing I forgot.

275
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,430
What about this?

276
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,520
It isn't mine.

277
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,510
It's yours.

278
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,550
You drew me?

279
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,320
Come back to the art club.

280
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Without you by my side,

281
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,410
it feels weird.

282
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,490
Listen to me.

283
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,090
You were just used to having me.

284
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,930
Meeting Theo
could help you draw again

285
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,130
I'm no use here.

286
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,530
When I saw Theo,

287
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,310
I got the inspiration to draw again.

288
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
But without you next to me,

289
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,330
I feel like I lack air to breathe.

290
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,250
You're exaggerating.

291
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,360
Why so dramatic?

292
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,820
I'm serious.

293
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,210
I've never been
more honest than this.

294
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,220
I can't go on without you.

295
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Come back to me.

296
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,910
I'm sorry for what I've done.

297
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,240
Please.

298
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,130
Please. Please.

299
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,750
Fine!

300
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,510
I'm back.

301
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,020
Really?

302
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,370
Yes.

303
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,440
Take a look at the piece I drew.

304
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,240
Did you really draw me?

305
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,440
This too.

306
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,640
Do you know what it means?

307
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,120
You can just see me off here.

308
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,100
I know that.

309
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,670
I'm okay now.

310
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,520
I feel better.

311
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,960
Are you sure?

312
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,440
Thank you so much

313
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,920
for making me feel like
I can still put faith in love.

314
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,800
Because of you,

315
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,630
I know I made
the right decision.

316
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,090
What decision?

317
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,790
I have something
important to tell you.

318
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,610
I'm going back to France.

319
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,480
Why?

320
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,620
My parents separated.

321
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,930
They probably sell this house soon.

322
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,030
My mom bought a
house in France years ago.

323
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,830
She planned to live there
with me after my graduation

324
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,320
and tell me about the divorce.

325
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
But I moved back here first.

326
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,100
So things turned out the way you see.

327
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,860
And?

328
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,370
I can't let my mom live alone.

329
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,600
Do you get it?

330
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,020
And then what?

331
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,050
If I go,

332
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,710
things between you and me…

333
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,560
This time,

334
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
I don't know when I will come back.

335
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,050
Hello, Sun.

336
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,790
How is it going, Theo?

337
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,410
I just finished work.

338
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I'm all right now.

339
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,750
Have you eaten? Do you
want me to grab you anything?

340
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,070
That's fine.

341
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,970
I'm okay.

342
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,020
Are you still thinking
about your parents?

343
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,310
Your fever might come back.

344
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,720
It won't.

345
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,780
I'm fine.

346
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,340
You don't sound so fine.

347
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Is there anything else on your mind?

348
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,780
Any sick person
would sound like me now.

349
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
When are you
moving back to France?

350
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,100
This month.

351
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,050
Are you sure you're moving there?

352
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,860
You're not alone as when
you first moved here.

353
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,780
I remember you love to eat it with lots of soup.

354
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,380
Right?

355
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,300
What is it?

356
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,370
Why aren't you eating?

357
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,180
Are you sick of Khai Palo already?

358
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,120
Theo learned the
truth about his parents.

359
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,050
His mom is moving to France

360
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,830
and he is too.

361
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,660
I don't want him to go.

362
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,280
We had so little time together.

363
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,490
He already made
his choice to live there.

364
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,010
If you truly love him,

365
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,410
you must accept it.

366
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,110
I'm glad to see you happy with him.

367
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,520
But he is about to
have a life in a better place.

368
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,670
It suits him more.

369
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,980
And his mom might
not be the only reason

370
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,750
but he's too afraid to tell you.

371
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,800
Who is that guy?

372
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,100
I saw him hugging
Theo in front of the house.

373
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,640
He comes to see Theo every day.

374
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,100
Theo's older friend from France.

375
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,890
He flew all the way here to see him.

376
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,430
Are you sure he's just a friend?

377
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,230
You know I love you, right?

378
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,020
I'm going to be frank with you.
I hope you don't mind.

379
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,050
I will always root for you, Akk.

380
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,390
I'm going to be frank with you.
I hope you don't mind.

381
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:35,840
Theo might be thinking there's
someone better for him than you.

382
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,940
People see he's with you.
They just can't help but gossip.

383
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,230
It should be better

384
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,090
if you get to be with
someone perfect for you.

385
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,070
Am I right?

386
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,670
[TWO WEEKS LATER]

387
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,840
Taking everything with you?

388
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,180
How are you?

389
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,910
Just finished the exam.

390
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,150
I'm free now.

391
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,130
Need any help?

392
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,440
I meant…

393
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,480
Us?

394
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,980
If you want to go,

395
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,460
I can't stop you.

396
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm okay.

397
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,220
I've been okay since the
day you told me the news.

398
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,970
I'd do the same if I were you.

399
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,750
Of course, you can't let her live alone.

400
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,960
Remember what I
said about your parents?

401
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,090
I told you to respect what they choose.

402
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:07,720
If I can't even do as I told you,
then I'm a hypocrite.

403
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,360
You said you were okay…

404
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,050
I really am okay to let you go.

405
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,240
I understand.

406
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,860
You'll always be my best friend.

407
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,830
You'll always be my best friend too.

408
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,150
Come on.

409
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
What can I help you with,
little bro Theo?

410
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,720
Let's start with this.

411
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,020
Your white sports car,
do you have a box for it yet?

412
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,960
Should I wrap it for you?

413
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,410
So it can stay in good
condition throughout the shipping.

414
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,790
We can pack the car later.

415
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,820
Help me with that box, will you?

416
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,320
Of course, little bro Theo.

417
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,660
What should I do with it?

418
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,020
Take it downstairs.

419
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,210
These too.

420
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,850
All of them.

421
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,780
Yeah?

422
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,280
Please get in.

423
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,140
Thanks a lot, Sun.

424
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,430
Theo.

425
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,090
Are you sure you have everything?

426
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,220
I am.

427
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,120
Come on.

428
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I already checked you guys in.

429
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,360
Thank you, Sun.

430
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,610
Aren't you going to see him off?

431
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,000
I will just say goodbye from here.

432
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,300
He already has
someone taking him there.

433
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,810
You were actually right.

434
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,450
It's right to let him go.

435
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,670
I don't deserve him.

436
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,020
Come on.

437
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,820
There's only one baguette left, Mom.

438
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,720
Sure.

439
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,660
I might be back in the evening.

440
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,810
If you want anything else,
just let me know.

441
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,610
Thank you.

442
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,300
Thank you. Have a good day.

443
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,050
A flower would be perfect
for a beautiful day like today.

444
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,800
Can I get you a rose?

445
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,300
Yes, please.

446
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,240
Thank you.

447
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,610
You said you hated coming here alone.

448
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,080
Akk!

449
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,510
I missed you so damn much.

450
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,810
Yes. Me too.

451
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,090
You don't need to miss me anymore.

452
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,140
I've come to see you here.

453
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,650
What brought you here?

454
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,010
He's already on board?

455
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,010
Yes. The plane
should take off by now.

456
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,590
Can you give this back to Theo?

457
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,270
I don't think I will get a
chance to see him again.

458
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,030
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

459
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,550
I don't think we can ever make it.

460
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,270
I can't take care of
him better than you do.

461
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,310
You're a better match than I am.

462
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,390
You think?

463
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,010
Well, you suck.

464
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,440
Let me ask you something.

465
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,420
Do you really love Theo?

466
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,960
Why are you asking me this?

467
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,750
He chose you anyway.

468
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,430
Because you gave
up on him so easily.

469
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,340
It made him really sad.

470
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,110
You know what he said to me?

471
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,360
When are you moving back to France?

472
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,600
This month.

473
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,420
Are you sure you're moving there?

474
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,750
You're not alone as
when you first moved here.

475
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,450
Are you leaving everything here behind?

476
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,240
Are you leaving everyone behind?

477
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,100
I want you to think it through.

478
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,570
Think about the one who
always stands next to you.

479
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,550
I love Akk so much.

480
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,440
I don't want to leave him.

481
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,490
But I need to.

482
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,880
The one hearing this
right now should be Akk.

483
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,610
I'm scared to tell him.

484
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,480
I don't want to hold him back.

485
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,530
I don't want him to wait.

486
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,380
I have no clue when I'll come back.

487
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,080
I don't want to be selfish.

488
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,300
Loving each other

489
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,170
but not being able to be together

490
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,840
is freaking terrible.

491
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,860
Are you sure we won't regret it?

492
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,170
I am.

493
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,830
Besides, I'm not
going back to France.

494
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,460
Theo and his mom
live there now. I don't.

495
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,230
You thought you were…

496
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,890
I move here permanently.

497
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,700
If you want to return Theo this pen,

498
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,290
find the way to do it in person.

499
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,400
Ah!

500
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:40,070
So when you acted cool and said
I would always be your best friend,

501
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,530
you thought Sun and I were…

502
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,260
Yes.

503
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,610
I'm sorry.

504
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,140
You're just so dumb.

505
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,060
After talking to Sun,

506
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:00,910
I told myself I'd do
anything to stand right next to you.

507
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,830
I tried every way

508
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,610
until I got a scholarship to
study photography here.

509
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,140
I made my dream come true,

510
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,840
both about being a videographer

511
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,030
and being with you.

512
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,210
I'm so happy

513
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,630
you're here.

514
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,660
I will take care of you.

515
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,090
I used to lack confidence

516
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,250
and thought I didn't deserve you.

517
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:59,570
But now I know the perfect
one for you and the one who
can take the best care of you is me.

518
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,360
I will never let you go again.

519
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,560
It's me. I'm your Te-Te guy.

520
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,250
You're just too much.

521
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,130
Why are you smiling?

522
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,100
I printed it in French just for you.

523
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,900
Important things
can't be seen with the eyes.

524
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:43,000
Only with the heart
that one can see clearly.

525
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,930
For me,

526
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,270
you're the one I
see with my heart, Akk.

527
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,250
What are you saying?

528
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,090
I've just lived here for a few days.

529
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,340
I have no idea what you said.

530
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,890
Do you want to
know what it means?

531
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,390
What does it mean?

532
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,380
Come closer.

533
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,420
I'll tell you.

534
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,810
Enchanté.

535
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,520
Enchanté.

536
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:47,990
When did you arrive?

537
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,080
4-5 days ago.

538
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,070
Where did you stay?

539
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,540
A hotel.

540
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,390
I'm starting to know
some French words.

541
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,730
Really?

542
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,390
Yes. Otherwise,
how could I come at all?

543
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,290
Let's hear some.

544
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,180
Bonjour.

545
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,770
Come on.

546
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,220
Will you marry me?

547
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,120
Hey!

548
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,920
Seriously?

549
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,270
Why else would I be here?

550
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,090
Do you even have a ring?

551
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,840
No.

552
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,730
I forgot.

553
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,340
But I do have a heart for you.

554
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,840
Don't be a wisecracker.

555
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:45,640
You haven't answered yet.

556
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,720
Will you marry me?

557
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,610
You have no ring.

558
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,060
Yet you have the guts
to ask me to marry you?

559
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:00,580
Close your eyes.

560
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,870
Mr. Theo,

561
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,780
will you marry me?

562
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,190
I will.
