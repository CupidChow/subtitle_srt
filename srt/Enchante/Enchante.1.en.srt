I'm Theo.

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,070
Ever since I returned here,
City of Disorder,

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,820
as opposed to its tagline,
City of Life,

4
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,620
The aroma of books and
the ambiance of a library

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,750
make me feel warm and
take me back to my own world.

6
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,410
[It's freakin' boring!]

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
When I'm alone,

8
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,570
I often think back to my childhood.

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,740
It was a time when we were
all happy with small things.

10
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,610
As a kid, I liked to be alone.

11
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,880
I didn't like to play with others.

12
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,260
Right!

13
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,820
I wasn't interested in
getting to know anyone,

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,900
but there was one kid who
always invaded my peaceful time.

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,230
I'm so sorry.

16
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,610
I didn't mean to.

17
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,040
I really am sorry.

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,480
I felt good when I
got to color on papers.

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,240
I liked it when my fingers
touched the piano's keyboard

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,230
because it
made my parents happy.

21
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,910
Shall we, madam?

22
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,350
Were you teasing us?

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Were you teasing us?

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,050
You were.

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,180
On a day with nice weather,

26
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,550
I'd kick the ball around
with my only friend,

27
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,350
the only one who
let me kick the ball at him.

28
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,540
But what was my favorite time?

29
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,170
It's when I got to read.

30
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,270
Reading took
me to another world

31
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,730
while sitting in the same chair.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,760
Let's go, son.

33
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,030
Get in the car.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was in Thailand until 6th grade.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,530
Then I moved to live in France
with my beloved grandmother.

[ 7 YEARS LATER ]

37
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Today's my grandmother's birthday.

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,930
But all I could find was pre-packaged spice.

39
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,620
What should I do?

40
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,320
Her adored grandson is cooking himself.
That's enough to make her happy.

41
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,550
But it may taste awful.

42
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Sun, I gotta go.

43
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,570
Hello.

44
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,230
I baked a carrot cake for Caroline

45
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,290
to thank her for
the Thai food the other day.

46
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,080
Thank you very much.

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,480
I'll keep it for her.

48
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,020
It looks so good.

49
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,430
What's that I'm smelling?

50
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,590
Is it Khai Pailo?

51
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,000
It's Khai Palo.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Right, Khai Palo.

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,960
Khai Palo.

54
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,070
It smells so good.

55
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,790
Well, I need to get going now.

56
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,530
Goodbye.

57

Good evening, sir.

59
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,460
Are you Madam Caroline's relative?

60
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,750
I am.

61
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,790
I'm sorry to tell you that

62
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,270
Madam Caroline got into an accident.

63
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,770
She just passed.

You don't like it?
Then don't buy it.

83

I only sell it to someone
who wants to wear it.

Then this old lady
butted in and left bad comments.

88

sell provocative clothes,

encourage young
girls to be seductive,

Auntie, you can't say that.

Girls are free to
wear anything they choose.

right to sexually harass them.

If you don't have anything positive
to say, don't say anything at all!

Why did I even ask you that?

I came back
sooner than we agreed on.

170
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,710
I wanted it to be a surprise.

171
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,070
Turns out the surprise is on me.

172
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,410
I can't reach my parents.

173
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,320
The plan is all screwed.

174
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,970
How have you been by the way?

175
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Long time no see.

176
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,390
Same old same old.

177
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,770
You look like a fox just the same.

178
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,350
Are you calling me
a dog again, asshole?

179
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,090
Ooh! The language.

180
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,360
Sorry.

181
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,570
I didn't mean to.

182
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,830
Sir.

183
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,080
My apology.

184
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,850
I…

185
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,530
Just talk the way you talk.

186
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,320
If I do that,

187
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm afraid you can't take it.

188
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Asshole!

189
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,810
You just started it.

190
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,600
With the perfect accent.

191
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,830
Back then,
I used a foul term to call you.

192
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,020
Your mom almost forbade
me to talk to you again ever.

193
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,630
We were still young then.

194
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,570
We're free to say it now.

195
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,930
Okay.

196
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,450
What are Im and Egg doing though?

197
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,790
Shit! I forgot.

198
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,450
They're waiting for food.

199
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,200
Come inside.

200
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,970
Come on.

201
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,130
What are they doing?

202
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,990
Akk, why are you
bringing your friend over now?

203
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,870
I have to record it again.

204
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,050
You look hot.

205
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,780
Are you interested in being
a model of my cloth shop?

206
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Don't you remember who this is?

207
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,670
Who?

208
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,270
Theo.

209
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,900
And who is Theo?

210
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,940
There are a bunch
of Theos in this world.

211
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,090
Theo who?

212
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,640
Nat-theo?

213
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,400
Mattheo?

214
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,520
Or Theo-Jiew?

215
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,550
That's New-Jiew.

216
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,510
Right.

217
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,490
Come on.

218
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,860
Do you really not remember him?

219
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,870
It's Theo, our neighbor.

220
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,760
Theo!!

221
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,770
That's me.

222
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,200
You've grown so much.

223
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,220
Your face is so cutesy and adorbs.

224
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,640
You're a hottie!

225
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,270
And you look just the same.

226
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,090
You've changed just a little.

227
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,830
I know I'm hotter.

228
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,900
I just had botox.
Look, my face is very small.

229
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,860
Beauty clinic, you know?

230
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,990
That's my secret.

231
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,270
Right.

232
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,270
Is this Egg?

233
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,000
This is my friend, Theo.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,130
He went to France
when you were very young.

235
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,650
I don't think you recognize him.

236
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,910
That's okay. I'm going
to memorize him right now.

237
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,680
He's so good-looking.
Very easy to remember.

238
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,790
Someone is being precocious here.

239
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,150
Clean up the stuff and get ready to eat.

240
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,390
Go.

241
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,220
Theo, stay with us for dinner.

242
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Sure.

243
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,330
You've just landed and must be starving.

244
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,620
It took two hours to get here from the
airport, and I still haven't eaten anything.

245
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,790
What did you do
with those two hours?

246
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,170
It's the ride from the airport to here.

247
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,050
The cab driver
provided excellent service.

248
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,400
The fare was only 1,200 baht.

249
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,380
Wait a minute.

250
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,470
From the airport to get here,
it's only a 30-minute drive.

251
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,300
And the taxi fare
should be around 200 baht only.

252
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,210
That's price gouging.

253
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,570
Really?

254
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,420
Yes. Now eat.

255
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,620
Take it as my apologies
for pulling you down the fence,

256
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,650
and my consolation for you being fooled.

257
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,760
Are you snubbing me?

258
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,640
No. I completely smacked you in the face.

259
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,230
So…

260
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,230
Can you eat that?

261
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,470
It's a simple dish and it's very spicy.

262
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,220
You lived overseas for so long.

263
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,100
No worries, Im.

264
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,750
I can eat it just fine.

265
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,330
It's so hot!

266
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Very hot!

267
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
You said you could eat it just fine.

268
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
Spicy.

269
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,030
I didn't know it would be that spicy.

270
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,530
Those football prints still there?

271
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,320
Of course.

272
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,390
I never cleaned them off.

273
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,730
Yes!

274
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,860
See?

275
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,030
No one can catch my powerful ball.

276
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,270
[Theo, I missed your calls. What is it, son?]

277
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,550
What's up, son?

278
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,790
I was in a meeting.
Sorry, I missed your calls.

279
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,410
I knew it.

280
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,390
That's why no one is home.

281
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,110
You're already back?

282
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,210
But you said you'd
come back next week.

283
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,150
I wanted to come earlier.

284
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,070
Without grandma there,
I was kind of…

285
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,970
lost.

286
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,040
Right?

287
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,830
Where are you anyway?

288
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm in Chiang Mai.

289
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,290
I didn't know you'd be back so soon.

290
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,970
Is mom there too?

291
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,930
She didn't pick up my calls either.

292
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,350
She's already in bed.

293
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,330
Let's do this. You find a
place to crash for tonight.

294
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,050
Do you want me to book a hotel for you?

295
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,810
Your mom and I will hurry
back first thing tomorrow.

296
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,710
That's fine.

297
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,070
I'll handle it myself.

298
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,410
I should be fine.

299
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,540
Sure.

300
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,930
Alright. Goodbye.

301
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,630
Hey, can you recommend
a place that isn't a scam?

302
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,340
Yeah! There's one at the mouth
of the alley and one at the end.

303
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,890
The first is full of ghosts and
the other one is full of robbers.

304
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,450
You prefer ghosts or robbers?

305
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,050
If you don't mind,
you're welcome to stay here.

306
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,910
I don't want to bother you.

307
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,250
Bother?

308
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,670
You slept over all the
time when we were kids.

309
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,230
My house isn't very tidy.

310
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,370
Especially in Akk's room.

311
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,190
It's okay.

312
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,040
I think I can manage.

313
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Akk's room is so messy.

314
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,340
But mine is clean, no dust at all.

315
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
That's too much, kiddo.

316
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,260
I'm going to tidy up my room.

317
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,130
You, stay here.

318
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,010
We don't usually
get to welcome guests.

319
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,230
We're a little excited.

320
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,030
You're the first.

321
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,470
Why did he seem so rushy?

322
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,770
- Hey.
- Shit!

323
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,940
Are you hiding porn?

324
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,450
I told you to wait downstairs.

325
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,730
It's fine.

326
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,190
It's not like I'm so snobbery.

327
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,720
I can sleep in this bed alright.

328
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,690
I can handle slobbishness.

329
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,270
What are you laughing at?

330
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,430
Seriously,

331
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,430
you don't have to
be slobbish like me.

332
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,590
You don't seem like one.

333
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,230
You're like a prince.

334
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,320
Your room is just the same.

335
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,510
You still have that?

336
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,950
Can I be a prince this time?

337
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Be a pilot first.

338
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I just like to collect things.

339
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:10,560
He joined Real Madrid,
Juve, and he's back again.

340
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,410
Yes. So?

341
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,330
You're so attached.

342
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,970
Yes, I'm loyal.

343
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,830
Do you have your pajamas?

344
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,170
I guess so.

345
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,770
If I said no, you'd make me
wear your favorite team's jersey.

346
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,170
So what if I do that?

347
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,210
I don't want to
wear anything I don't like.

348
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,770
What are you doing?

349
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,460
Sit-ups.

350
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,770
Damn it.

351
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,770
It's 2 in the morning.

352
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,080
I want to be tired
so I can fall asleep.

353
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,840
Shit! I lost count.

354
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,330
You're working out
now and you'll be sweating.

355
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,430
Then you'll
have to take a shower.

356
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,450
You can't be sleepy anymore.

357
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,770
I will just go to bed.

358
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,490
No more shower.

359
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,790
Hold that thought.

360
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,430
I don't want to smell your sweat.

361
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,930
And I don't want
your sweat on my bed.

362
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,170
I can sleep on the floor.

363
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,350
There.

364
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,890
The pillow is all you got.

365
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,250
So you won't have a
sore neck tomorrow morning.

366
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,850
Hello.

367
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,490
Theo, it's mommy.

368
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,940
Mom!

369
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,540
Get in normally.

370
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,200
Don't climb the wall again.

371
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,500
I know.

372
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,410
I should get going.

373
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,590
See you.

374
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,030
Tell your parents I said hi.

375
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,090
Theo!

376
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,600
Theo.

377
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,770
I missed you so much.

378
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,560
Come here.

379
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,730
I missed you.
Can I get a kiss?

380
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,870
Why didn't you say
you'd come back sooner?

381
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,940
She wanted to go get you there

382
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,860
so it wouldn't be tiring for you.

383
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,550
Hello.

384
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,770
So how was last night?

385
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,060
You spent the night
at Akk's place, right?

386
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,040
I did.

387
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,940
Thanks a lot, Akk.

388
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,980
You two hadn't met for almost 10
years and you still recognize each other.

389
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,600
Nearly didn't recognize him at first.

390
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,680
Aren't you going to work today?

391
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,400
I am but I want to talk to you first.

392
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,810
The second semester is
starting soon and I'm getting busier.

393
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,530
Theo, do you want
to see the university?

394
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,990
I think I should do
a little bit of exploring.

395
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,000
But you can go ahead.

396
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
I will go later with Akk.

397
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,500
How about you ask me first?

398
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,340
You should go then.

399
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,640
This place is cute.

400
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But I don't know if
their product is good.

401
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,450
You haven't tried?

402
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,280
You show no interest in
supporting local businesses.

403
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,000
In France, people always
support small businesses.

404
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,080
Small shops can run just fine
and grow with their community.

405
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,430
What's with you?

406
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,280
No. What's with you?

407
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,620
Why gave me a long lecture?

408
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,620
I didn't try it because
I gave you a promise.

409
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,410
An ice-cream shop!

410
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,700
It isn't opened yet.

411
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,660
When it is, let's come together.

412
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,740
Of course.

413
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,040
Do you promise?

414
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,390
Break the promise and
your house will explode.

415
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,800
Are you afraid your
house would explode?

416
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,180
I'm not. That's for kids.

417
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,540
I'm just a man of my word.

418
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Aw! Good boy.

419
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,540
Good boy, my ass.

420
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,090
I'm not a dog.

421
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,100
What's your choice?

422
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,950
A Mercedes-Benz.

423
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,800
That joke is very old.

424
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,540
Thailand Joke Association has
banned people from saying that.

425
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,110
Otherwise, you'll be arrested.

426
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,710
That's exaggerating.

427
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,500
Fine. No more jokes.

428
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,370
What flavor do you want?

429
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,420
Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee,
Strawberry, Green Tea?

430
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,520
Aren't they too ordinary?

431
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,980
Plum, Coconut,
Marshmallow, Cotton Candy?

432
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,000
Anything more interesting?

433
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,510
Mango with Salt Dip, Pickled Guava,
Star Gooseberry Salad with Shrimp Paste?

434
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,630
Do they have Khai Palo flavor?

435
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,740
Damn you! No.

436
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,620
That's too weird.

437
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,060
They have Star Gooseberry
Salad with Shrimp Paste.

438
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,740
Why not add Khai Palo too?

439
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,340
Why Khai Palo though?

440
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,880
I just feel like it.

441
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,610
So, what flavor would you like?

442
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,200
This one looks good too.

443
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
Can we even finish them?

444
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,780
I want to taste them all.

445
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,750
Why didn't you ask for
a taste before you ordered?

446
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,800
If I tasted all of these,
she would kill me.

447
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,760
She wouldn't!

448
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,420
I'll eat it then.

449
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,690
Did you just curse at me?

450
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
This one is really good.

451
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,620
Can I try?

452
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,920
Wow!

453
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,420
It's really good.

454
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,760
You almost finished it.

455
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,680
No. This one is mine.

456
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,720
Go for a new one.
You have plenty of choices.

457
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,640
But I like that one.

458
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,520
I fell for it first.

459
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,890
I fell first.

460
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,970
I will eat all of it.

461
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,980
I fell first.

462
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,000
I fell first.

463
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,450
- I fell first.
- I fell first.

464
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,630
Jackass.

465
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,210
I want that one.

466
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,580
Akk, you have yours.

467
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,440
But I want that flavor.

468
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,630
That one is really good.

469
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,580
But I want that.

470
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,140
Try it.

471
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,160
I want that one.

472
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,760
I want it.

473
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,870
I want what you have.

474
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,640
Okay. Let's share.

475
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Ew! Shimp paste.

476
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,520
Let me call a cab.

477
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,270
Let's not.

478
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,220
Why not?

479
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,460
I have a bad
first impression of cabs.

480
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,730
I don't want to get fooled again.

481
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,520
You won't
because you go with me.

482
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,740
Not all taxis are like that.

483
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,180
You can trust me.

484
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,120
Yeah?

485
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,880
Yes.

486
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Can I try getting on a bus?

487
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,940
Buses here aren't
like the ones in France.

488
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,710
You will be shocked.

489
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,260
That's too much. I can do it.

490
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,430
Excuse me.

491
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
After you, sir.

492
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,140
I'm sorry.

493
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,840
Shocking, right?

494
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,580
You should go ahead.

495
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,930
I need to go to work.

496
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,170
Why did you come then?

497
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,190
To keep you company.

498
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,200
I was afraid you'd get lost.

499
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,470
I can't be that bad.

500
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,640
Thanks anyway.

501
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,050
My workplace isn't far.
I can take a motorbike taxi there.

502
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,520
I should go now.

503
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,840
See you.

504
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,060
Yes, Dad.

505
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,000
Hi, Theo.

506
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,480
Do you like my university?

507
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,150
It's nice.

508
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,240
The surrounding is great.

509
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,850
Should I call staff and tell
him to enroll in classes for you?

510
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,150
That's okay.

511
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,000
I should do it myself.

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,190
I don't want people to say
Dr. Thamrong's son can't do anything himself.

513
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,320
Okay.

514
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,660
Whatever suits you.

515
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,110
All right.

516
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,390
Bye, Dad.

517
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,090
I'm here to
pick up the photos, please.

518
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,120
Of course.

519
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,970
Thank you.

520
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,700
(Are you home yet?)

521
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,560
(Do you know the way home?)

522
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,060
He should be fine.

523
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,000
Akk.

524
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:24,980
Yes.

525
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,040
When you finish
retouching the photos,

526
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,780
print them out
and you're free to go.

527
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,710
Sure.

528
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Why isn't he home yet?

529
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,430
Akk!

530
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,370
Why are you in my frame?

531
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,370
You just ruined my video.

532
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,430
What did I do wrong now?

533
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,930
You came home
just the right time.

534
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,680
Take a shower
and we'll have dinner.

535
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,270
The meal is ready.

536
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,280
Im.

537
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,620
Hasn't Theo got home yet?

538
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,830
No clue.

539
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,930
I didn't look.

540
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,070
He might be out having
dinner with his parents.

541
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,770
Their beloved
son is back after all.

542
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,240
Try calling him.

543
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,950
Yes, Por?

544
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,400
Akk.

545
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,790
Are you free tonight?

546
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,460
M just called in sick.

547
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,900
He was supposed to develop films
after the shop is closed tonight.

548
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,370
This job should be done ages ago.

549
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,420
Many of them are due tomorrow.

550
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,250
Can you come instead?

551
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,830
I just got home.

552
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,150
Why didn't you say
anything when I was still there?

553
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,350
I just told you M couldn't do it.

554
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,180
I always do it myself.

555
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
But I'm supposed to
meet with my wife tonight.

556
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,230
I want no problem with her.

557
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,540
Please. I'll pay you extra.

558
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,010
Can you please help?

559
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,910
Just for tonight.

560
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,130
All right.

561
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,790
You need to take M's shift again?

562
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,450
This guy is always on leave.

563
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,310
It's okay. Por will pay me extra.

564
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,670
I'll make you a dinner box
then so you don't have to buy food.

565
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,690
It's fine. I can do it.

566
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,040
No. I will.

567
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
You're a great dancer.

568
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,050
That's too much.

569
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,300
I can't finish all that.

570
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,850
You must.

571
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,570
You asked me to cook Khai Palo.

572
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,360
You must eat.

573
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,250
Who is calling a home phone?

574
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,570
No idea.

575
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,150
Hello.

576
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,240
May I speak with
Mr. Akk Itsara, please?

577
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,640
This is him speaking.

578
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
I'm calling from a police station.

579
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,270
It's about
Mr. Theo Asawa-ekanan.

580
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,030
Akk!

581
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,420
The Flash Akk.

582
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,610
Why so fast?

583
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,210
Theo!

584
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,330
How are you?

585
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,870
Are you hurt?

586
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,510
Thanks for telling Im to
make Khai Palo for me.

587
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,860
I wanted to eat it.

588
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,310
Why would my
sister cook it for you?

589
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,040
Teur, my ass!

590
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,950
Did you just curse at me?

591
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,910
Mencher?

592
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,790
Menter?

593
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,420
Moncher.

594
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,780
Menter!

595
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,020
Can you stop tapping?

596
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,620
You’re distracting people.

597
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,400
Can I have the ball back?

598
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,260
Are you picking a fight with me?

599
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,160
Done!

600
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,550
This way,
no one knows what I wrote down.

601
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,130
I think someone does.
