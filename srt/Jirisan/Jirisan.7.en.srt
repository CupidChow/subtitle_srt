Are you still afraid of the mountain?

3

If you're scared that people die up there,

You said you didn't want to live a humiliating life, and you got what you wanted.

You said you saw the wildfire closures banner, right?

299
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,981
It was too dark...

300
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,451
I couldn't see anything else.

301
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,655
I must find out where it is...

302
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,699
But that was all I saw.

303
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,743
This isn't your problem only.

304
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,213
Mountains are not like cities.

305
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:40,123
Because there are no fire trails, access to fire trucks is limited,

306
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,209
which means it's harder to directly put out the fire.

307
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,880
A helicopter isn't an option at night or in the wind, either.

308
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,051
So the great damage is inevitable if a fire breaks out.

309
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,581
Forest fire is something everyone must prevent.

310
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,307
We'll all be watching carefully,

311
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,851
so don't burden yourself alone.

312
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:04,821
To be honest... I was hoping it ended.

313
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,694
Because I hadn't had the visions in months.

314
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,322
It's supposed to be a gift from the mountains, right?

315
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,076
That's how you saved Seung Hun and Private Ahn.

316
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,129
And you will this time, too.

317
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,547
Let's eat before it gets overcooked.

318
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,144
Should we add boiled eggs

319
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,054
to celebrate our winning?

320
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,025
And also triangle rice rolls.

321
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,426
Sure.

322
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:17,815
As you know, wildfire prevention season starts next week.

323
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,860
A low humidity level warning has already been issued

324
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,588
and the wind is speeding up.

325
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,632
In other words,

326
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:28,635
this is when the chances of forest fires are the highest.

327
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:33,630
You must focus on trail patrol including restricted trails,

328
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,759
especially on prohibiting the use of fire.

00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:49,810
Hyun Jo, you're on ground duty with Yang Sun until your leg heals.

332
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,367
Be careful.

333
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,829
I'm your senior.

334
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,208
That's why I care about you.

335
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,756
The prevention season doesn't start till next week.

336
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,676
So don't be too anxious.

337
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,543
- Shall we check the equipment first?
- Okay.

338
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:30,228
Are all of these wildland fire gear?

339
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,840
Yes. There shouldn't be the smallest defect.

340
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,009
They're related to the life and death of the rangers.

341
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:38,804
What if there's a report made while up on the mountain?

342
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:40,723
We don't have time to come down to get the gear.

343
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:44,409
There are fire gear cabinets installed in places with frequent forest fires.

344
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,604
They have all of these in there.

345
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,205
- Are these fireproof tents?
- Yes.

346
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,884
It's the last resort for real emergencies,

347
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:53,845
but you can't guarantee 100% safety.

348
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,837
Forest fires are just that dangerous.

349
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,725
When a wildfire breaks out, the temperature of the smoke itself is 600º C,

350
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:02,219
and the core rises up to 1,200º C.

351
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,378
Looks delicious, right?

352
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,145
We need to boil a little more.

353
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,608
- Well done.
- Here, take this.

354
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,301
Take more.

355
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,705
- You first!
- No, go ahead.

356
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,448
Looks so good.

357
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,701
It's so good.

358
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,536
It's my turn now.

359
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,915
Go ahead.

360
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,374

361
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,959

- Is it?

362
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,127
She gave her a bad review last time.

363
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,638
Have these.

364
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,965
- It's amazing.
- Right?

365
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,493
This one also.

366
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,394
So last time...

367
00:37:58,284 --> 00:38:00,369
I'll go to the administration to get some documents.

368
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:03,873
Please go to the office and get the closures banner and the fliers.

369
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:05,074
Okay.

370
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,163

- Oh, hey.

371
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:30,849

Smoke has been detected on a forest watch camera.

377
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:02,431
It looks like Baekto Valley area.

378
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:06,118
Report if any ranger can go check in person.

379
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,965
Haedong Two, currently at the Baekto Valley Ridge. We'll check.

380
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,790
Haedong two. A wildfire confirmed. It looks like Baekto Valley, near Dalgwi Forest.

381
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,226
We're 1 km away. We'll mobilize first.

383

We'll come, too.

384
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,403
The trail will be closed due to a wildfire.

385

I repeat.

386
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,316
The trail will be closed due to a wildfire.

387
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:06,053
Wait! Is that smoke from a fire?

388
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:09,097
- Right there.
- Look at that grey smoke.

389
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,420
Just look.

390
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:16,822

00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:53,620
There's something you can do even with your leg hurt.

395
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,800
Okay.

396
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,399
Arrived at Dalgwi Forest!

397
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:16,660

Jangteomok 1.

No crown fire yet.
[A forest fire that spreads from treetop to treetop.]

The wind isn't too strong yet. We can contain it as long as we get the firelines set.

407
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:37,687
Hey.

408
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:41,174
As you know, we can't use mechanized equipment because no firetrucks can get near.

409
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:42,901
We'll have to put it out in indirect ways.

410
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:44,795
Do your best with the firelines.

411
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:48,470
We must prevent the fires from spreading toward the southeast to the pine tree habitat.

412
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,576
Yes, Sir!

But it's still a relief.

418
00:43:03,338 --> 00:43:06,424
The Dalgwi Forest is a climax forest, mainly comprised of oak trees.

419
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:09,411
Oak trees have thick bark with high moisture content

420
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:12,097
and aren't prone to crown fires.

421
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:16,450
If we can only suppress the front, we'll be able to put it out early.

422
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:20,680
There it is.

423

Get down!

425
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:38,335
We've controlled most of the main fires.

426
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,604
If they drop water one more time, along with the ground work,

427
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:44,280
we'll be able to contain the fire.

428
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,150
Are you all right?

429
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,111

We'll rest up there until we change shifts with the mop-up team.

434

Okay.

435
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,920
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

436
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:59,741
You don't think

437
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:03,795
there's a wildfire closures banner near here, do you?

438
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:07,290
What are you talking about? The banners aren't even up yet.

439
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,929
Plus, who would put up a banner so deep in the forest?

440
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,760
Yeah... You're right.

441
00:47:39,807 --> 00:47:41,407
Get in safely.

442
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:43,368
Are you going back to the mountain?

443
00:47:43,368 --> 00:47:45,370
Yup. I'll be joining the mop-up team.

444
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,438
How long do you have to do that for?

445
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:50,124
Are all rangers joining in?

446
00:47:50,124 --> 00:47:52,752
Mop-up is just as important as initial control.

447
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:57,215
A tiny ember buried underground can cause a bigger fire.

- What is it?
- Illegal herb collecting.

458
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:34,740
I brought them here since it's late and it'll be dangerous to make it all the way down.

00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,390
Oh...

- Herb collectors.

Since the banners are waterproof,

they use them as cushion fabrics or blankets.
