Lee Da Won!

00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,793
- Lee Da Won.
- Da Won!

5
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:03,187
Lee Da Won's cell phone signal was last detected

6
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,814
from the repeater in Seongnae Stream, Jeonmuk Valley.

7
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,191
She's new but still a ranger.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,842
She would have left some kind of a sign.

9
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:12,388
There's a dead tree southeast of Hurricane Lily Habitat in Jeonmuk Valley.

10
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,114
We must check under that tree.

11
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,699
That signal only you and Hyun Jo know?

12
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,600
What's that?

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,893
It's near the pebbly road at Haebawi Rock.

14
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:19,937
How did it go? Did you find her?

15
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:21,589
We found a pink-colored cell phone.

16
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:22,940
It's covered in blood.

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,650
But... what about Captain Jo Dae Jin?

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,694
So this was recorded on Da Won's phone?

19
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:27,903
Then, let's go down together.

20
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,030
No. I'll go by myself.

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,299
Haedong Two! Found the missing at the Amleung Ridge!

22
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,034
How's Da Won? Is she all right?

23
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,604
The missing... has no pulse and is not breathing.

24
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:37,688
Presumed dead.

25
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,331
We have a couple of things to ask you.

26
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,418
The deceased... was holding this in her hand.

27
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,478
Did you do that to Da Won?

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,504
Why did you do it?

29
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:46,672
And Hyun Jo, too?

30
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,966
Did you do that to Hyun Jo?

31
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,468
Why did you do that? Why?

32
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:54,013
Tell Seo Yi Kang at Haedong Ranger Station

33
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,374
that I didn't leave the mark this time.

34
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,935
He said he didn't leave the mark this time?

35
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,171
When you and Hyun Jo had that accident,

36
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,089
why did you go to Black Bridge Valley?

37
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:06,508
What happened to you and Hyun Jo?

38
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:08,819
What were you doing with Da Won?

39
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,738
Why do you suspect the captain?

40
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,965
Why did you return to the mountain?

41
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,867
I can't understand any of it.

42
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,560
Maybe you shouldn't have come back.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,481
When do you think... we can quit this work?

44
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,183
It's not something you can quit when you want to.

45
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,945
It involves saving people's lives.

46
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,446
Saving people's lives is our job.

47
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:31,489
But I'm seeing more dead people than live ones.

48
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:32,660
Do you remember him?
[Chairperson Yang Geun Tak]

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,720
He's come back to the mountain.

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,139
The mountain spirit will be infuriated once again.

51
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,308
The mountain spirit is not the only one up there.

52
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:41,361
Grandma told me a long time ago,

53
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,630
that the evil spirit comes before the mountain spirit.

Never forget, especially the Black Bridge Valley area.

Oh, I see.

62

This place is a perfect location for cable cars.

63
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:38,700
We'd appreciate some help from the national park to get consent from the villagers.

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,031
It'll be good for the mountain and the residents.

65
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,527
The national park regulations require that we stay neutral.

66
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,480
Our job is to show the roads.

67

Please say hello. This is the mayor of Black Bridge Valley Village.

as much relocation compensation as possible.

absolutely regret this.

It's him! The cable car man.

96
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,933
He messed with the well to kick us out from here!

97
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,286
That's right. That's right.

98
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:29,281
- It was him.
- Yes, it must be him.

99
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,636
Has anyone seen him putting that in there?

100
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,996
We've not seen him do it.

101
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,440
We can't report him to the police when we're not even sure.

102
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,292
Are you saying we should do nothing?

103
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,438
This might not be the end. He could do something else to us.

104
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,741
Don't worry too much.

105
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:51,411
We'll do more patrols.

106
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,473
And think of ways to enhance village security.

107
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:00,454
We'll protect you with all our might!

108

Can this be just a coincidence?

Did you guys hear that just now?

114
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,958
Is this the Black Bridge Valley Village?

115
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,669
Yes, sir. It's supposed to be in the Deokseoryeong area.

116
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,356
But it doesn't show on the map.

117
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:51,805
Shouldn't we go look?

118
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:53,849
Has there been any missing report?

119
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,376
No.

120
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,797
Then don't worry about it.

121
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,527
We've had a lot of people asking for time off lately.

Even if we are short-staffed, please plan thoroughly

123

and resolve the mountain spirit ritual without an issue.

124
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,552
But, Sir.

125
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,245
That's enough.

126
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:19,140
He could've staged this for more views.

127
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,834
But it could be real.

128
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,103
Looks like his cell phone was working well enough to post the video.

129
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,589
If he were in real danger, he would've called for help.

130
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,924
He dropped his phone and the video ended.

131
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,870
Maybe the phone broke, so he couldn't call.

132
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,990
You spent two hours carrying that jerk down.

133

It will be exactly like that.

You go up there for this, there's a 98% chance it's nothing.

- Yes, it is!
- What's wrong with that?

- Don't you get days off?
- I take every day off.

The guy who posted that Black Bridge Valley video?

We found him by the road and took him to the hospital earlier, but he was totally out of his mind.

Didn't Yi Kang and Hyun Jo go there earlier?

Yes... Black Bridge Village in Deokseoryeong.

- Is this your first time here, too?
- I never had a reason to come.

215

I heard wild animals' eyes look like that, reflected in the light.

That's impossible. I heard Asian black bears hate people.

Also, they aren't aggressive, as long as we don't attack them first.

I've never seen anything like this before.

328

Even if they aren't aggressive, bears are the wildest of wild beasts.

They're over two meters tall and weigh over 100kg.

I don't know why they're so provoked, but I'm sure it's more dangerous than a ghost light.

00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:54,258
- Pass me your walkie.
- Yes.

332
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,511
The battery's dead.

333
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,595
This is a "no signal" area.

334
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,752
We're trapped.

335
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,520
[1991]

336
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,878
Mayor!

337
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:25,617
Cable cars or whatever...

338
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,410
I can't leave this place now.

339
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,370
We're not here because of the cable cars.

340
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,374
Most of the villagers have left.

341
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,002
The park decided to demolish the village, too.

342
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:39,788
- Why don't you move to...
- I'm not leaving!

343
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:03,143
How have you been? Did you eat?

344
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:06,908
Dad keeps saying he sees things.

345
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,910
What do you mean?

346
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,454
He says he sees ghost lights.

347
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:14,399
There's no such thing. He saw wrong.

348
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,019
No! There is. I saw them, too.

349
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:22,890
Let's call it a day.

350
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,303
Yes, sir.

351
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,022
- This way.
[2019]

352
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:57,609
Why are you trying to meet him at this point?

353
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,669
Are you charging him a fine?

354
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:02,572
- How's his condition?
- They say he's much better.

355
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,190
That's the one.

356
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:19,064
Hello?

357
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,900
So, on my way from Deokseoryeong to Black Bridge Valley,

358
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,027
- there was some woman.
- Excuse me?

359
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:26,370
Anyway, I've made the call.

360
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,799
What did you say?

361
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,190
About what?

362
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:36,764
Someone was at Deokseoryeong?

363
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,501
No, well... It was her fault.

364
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,254
Why did she go up there when she clearly was not in good shape?

365
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:47,172
Don't tell me you left a lost person there and came down on your own.

366
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:50,945
Could you let the rangers know that I'm here?

367
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,487
Jeez, lady.

368
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,642
Do you want me to take myself in for illegal hiking?

369
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:59,412
I'll make a report on my way down, once I'm done with my business.

370
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,135
Where was it?

371
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:09,681
Well, I... I was busy, too.

372
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,171
Where the hell was it?

373
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,133
When will they leave?

374
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:34,438
How would I know?

375
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:37,708
I'm sorry.

376
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,548
But... I didn't expect a place like this in the mountains.

377
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,967
It must have been a secret hideout for the red commies.

378
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,113
What? There's a pole.

379
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:52,615
It must be one left behind by the illegal hikers.

380
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:55,551
More like crampons. Pretty serious.

381
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:11,900
- Whoa!
- What was that?

382
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,360
- Senior...
- What's up with you?

383
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,022
There's someone here.

384
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,703
Her breathing is too weak. She has serious hypothermia.

385
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,924
We must hurry up and get her to a hospital.

386
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,878
Will you be okay?

387
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:37,525
Do I have a choice? We must go.

388
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,065
There's been a missing report.

389
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,827
Please gather at the restricted trail entrance in Deokseoryeong.

390
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:16,574
I called each shelter and the rangers on their day off.

391
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,177
Any news from Yi Kang and Hyun Jo?

392
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,445
No.

393
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:26,559
But... those two aren't the only ones at Black Bridge Valley.

394
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:58,007
Senior, we're back again.

395
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,069
You all right?

396
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,931
What's that?

397
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,057
Ah, honestly.

398
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,636
What happened? We couldn't reach you.

399
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:12,731
Who's that?

400
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,094
- And what's that?
- Get her on your back.

401
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,412
Quickly!

402
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,860
What is that?

403
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,269
- Get on.
- Hurry up!

404
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:28,980
What the heck? What is that?

405
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,664
Hurry up! Hurry!

406
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,318
In here.

407
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,611
Watch your step.

408
00:37:36,611 --> 00:37:38,238
On two.

409
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,259
What happened?

410
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,036
- She's in a bad state.
- I know.

411
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:47,206
That's why we were trying so hard to get down, but couldn't find the way out.

412
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:49,708
Same for us, too.

413
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:53,103
We kept going around in one direction in the foggy area.

414
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,564
We could only come because of your flashlights.

415
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,942
- What's that thing?
- Bears.

416
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,486
- What?
- What?

417
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,039
Nonsense.

418
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:09,636
What are you saying? Are we trapped?

419
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:11,731
Hang on. There must be a way.

420
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,024
A way? What way?

421
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,735
You can't get out because you can't find your way.

422
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,905
- Calm yourself down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

423
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:21,574
Why did you come up here in the first place and get us into this?

424
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:24,884
Did I tell you to come? Go back down then.

425
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,955
- Stop it, both of you.
- Stop what?

426
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:30,041
The promotion test is only a few days away.

427
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,252
I don't have a second to waste, and what the heck am I doing here?

428
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:36,714
Did you take a day off only for that? When everyone's busy as hell?

429
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,134
Only? It's something very important for me.

430
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,862
I'm meeting Yang Sun's mother soon for a pre-wedding introduction.

431
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:48,309
I should at least have a team leader title since I've got nothing else!

432
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,227
Hey, seriously.

433
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,772
Is that something you should say here and now?

434
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:54,899
Team leader? What's the big deal about the title?

435
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,401
Stop bragging. You're already a team leader.

436
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,779
Do you think it's all fun and games for me?

437
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,698
I've not rested a day since I got promoted.

438
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:03,798
And now...

439
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:09,163
I can't use my legs.

440
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:11,916
I might not be able to walk

441
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,226
if I keep climbing the mountain.

442
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:25,221
Her condition's gotten worse.

443
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:27,639
I don't think she can last long.

444
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:36,565
Park Il Hae. Can you hear me?

445
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:39,652
- Did you get to Black Bridge Valley?
- Yes, sir.

446
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:41,112
We met Yi Kang and Hyun Jo.

447
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,407
We got a call about a missing person

448
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:46,216
between Deokseoryeong and Black Bridge Valley.

449
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,578
Do you mean the woman in a red jacket?

450
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:52,915
Did you find her? How is she?

451
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:56,252
She's not good. We must take her to the hospital immediately.

452
00:39:56,252 --> 00:39:59,395
Our situation's not that great either. We can't find our way out.

453
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:03,525
It's hard to secure a clear view because of the fog, and the GPS is not working.

454
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,821
We don't know why, but the Asian black bears aren't leaving our side.

455
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,050
Yi Kang and Hyun Jo tried to carry the victim down, but they failed.

456
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,088
Let me talk to Yi Kang.

457
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:23,845
Seo Yi Kang speaking.

458
00:40:23,845 --> 00:40:26,197
You will take the lead and find the way.

459
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:29,142
You're the fastest, and you know the mountain best.

460
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,328
I'm not confident.

461
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,814
I cannot find the way.

462
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:38,818
I almost got lost there once, too.

463
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:41,364
And a missing person ended up dying because of me.

464
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,978
I analyzed the surroundings and found out why.

465
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,915
It was because I was tracing the animal path, not the human one.

466
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:55,293
I'll take her. You just hurt your knees.

467
00:40:55,293 --> 00:41:00,023
I'll do it. My knees are newer than yours.

468
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,692
The man-made path leads to the village,

469
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:05,737
but the one the animals have made is in the opposite direction.

470
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:09,891
If you feel like you're going in circles, go the opposite way, no matter what.

471
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:14,621
Abandon everything except your headlamps and walkies. Make yourselves as light as possible.

472
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:17,800
Hyun Jo, you take the front since you can steadily carry her.

473
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,350
Goo Yeong, assist him, and Il Hae, the rear.

474
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:30,670
You failed when you were in pairs, but now it's four of you.

475
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,607
Trust one another.

476
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,570
Don't worry about anything, just run forward.

477
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:42,420
Your fellow rangers will watch your back.

478
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:11,537
Let's go. Run!

479
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:02,913
What's the matter? What happened?

480
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,396
Please get rid of the trees, too.

481
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,410
[Kim Jae Gyeong]

482
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,047
Had I saved her...

483
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:06,943
could I have saved this village?

484
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:21,555
Do you... want to quit this job?

485
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:26,212
Quitting won't end it.

486
00:44:26,212 --> 00:44:28,965
You'll keep seeing dead people on the mountain,

487
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,467
and only feel guiltier with time.

488
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:36,381
You can't escape the mountain even if you want to.

489
00:44:36,381 --> 00:44:38,474
With that sympathy in your mind,
[Kim Jae Gyeong]

490
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:42,061

Of course.

It's true.

Well, anyhow.

I guess you should thank the bears.

Without a missing report.

It would have been impossible to find her hidden in the rocks on that huge mountain, otherwise.
