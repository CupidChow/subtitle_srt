There's been an SOS report from Sumgol Rock in Dowon Valley.

This is a false report. Is this okay?

The ghost I told you about!

12

Could there really be a ghost on the mountain?

13
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,052
If someone had a strong soul, they could remain there as a ghost.

Kind of like a landmine.

You've murdered my husband!

It means a civilian died because of a park ranger's mistake.

20
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,761
I saw a hand. There were five scratch scars.

You think people will believe that?

22

I will find that person,

I'm positive.

This is the potato bomb that caused the accident.

If you ever find something similar on the mountain,

please don't touch it and report it to the national park immediately.

How did you know it was here?

169
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:58,395
Se Wook... told me.

170
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,088
Se Wook?

171
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:14,170
He said he saw my grandpa around here, on the day the bomb exploded.

172
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,349
Your grandfather?

173
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,996
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

174
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:27,957
I wanted to trust my grandpa.

175
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,174
Who's there?

176
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,988
Grandpa, I thought you went to the mountain.

177
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:45,017
Well, I had to find something.

178
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,055
- Do you need some help?
- No, no.

179
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,959
Don't worry about it. Just go.

180
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,195
Then I'll be back.

181
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,147
Okay.

182
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,754
Until then, I had no idea it was a bomb.

183
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:10,250
Nor did I know grandpa had such things.

184
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,000
That's when I knew it was a bomb.

185
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,669
Homemade bombs used by poachers

186
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,756
who hunted Asian black bears in the 60s and 70s.

187
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,300
But even then, I kept doubting it.

188
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,054
That it's not grandpa's.

189
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,514
Since it could have already been in the mountain.

190
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,807
But...

191
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,352
You must be tired because of this incident.

192
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,064
Because of the potato bomb or whatever.

193
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:44,060
I'm sorry, but I need to go to the station right now.

194
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,710
What are you doing there?

195
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,488
- What did you do with the bombs?
- What?

196
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,358
The bombs that you were holding!

197
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:04,519
Those bombs... just disappeared.

198
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,755
What?

199
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:10,969
I put them back in storage, but I found out today that they were gone.

200
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,138
Are you sure they disappeared?

201
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,933
Why would I lie?

202
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,213
- Where did you go that day?
- What?

203
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:25,233
You frequent Saema Valley to catch snakes!

204
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,771
You think I killed Mr. Choi with that bomb?

205
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,066
Well...

206
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,228
People might misunderstand.

207
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,415
Don't say a word to anyone, okay?

208
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,901
I wanted to trust my grandpa.

209
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:54,012
That's why I couldn't tell anyone.

210
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,900
But I got scared...

211
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,336
There were three bombs missing.

212
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:13,556
I thought the rest might still be here.

213
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,992
That's why I came.

214
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,165
But I didn't think it would actually be here.

215
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:29,147
Are you sure that trap belongs to your grandfather?

216
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:35,962
First, tell the cops everything you know.

217
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,669
I know how you feel... but that's the right thing to do.

218
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:46,206
Okay.

219
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,337
- Can you get up?
- Yes.

220
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,018
Hold on to my rucksack. It'll be better than walking on your own.

221
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,480
Be careful.

222
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,095
It's not the grandpa.

223
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,306
He didn't have any scars on his hand.

224
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,767
It's Lee Se Wook.

225

Whether it's the grandpa or Lee Se Wook,

the police will uncover the truth.

227

I saw the hand for sure.

228
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,826
There were scars on the hand. Trust me.

229

Do you think people will believe that?

230
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:59,262
Get in. We'll take you to the police substation.

231

I'll come, too.

The potato bomb.

You placed it there at Saema Valley's tomb site.

What nonsense are you talking about?

Yes. This is him, I'm sure.

He left the bomb by the gravesite... after we'd left.

How can I help you?

Could I check the security camera outside the building?

There's no camera on the mountain,

but there is one at the entrance to it.

I must prove that he went to the mountain that day.

If I can only spot him in the recordings...

Then I can prove that he's the criminal.

Why did you keep it a secret that the bombs disappeared?

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,188
Because I was afraid of this exact thing happening!
