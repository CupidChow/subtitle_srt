When I got injured here before,

00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,809
there were yellow ribbons.

5
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,603
As if... they wanted you to get lost.

6
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,900
They tied them another way, not to the top.

The hiker looking at the pink rucksack handed him a yogurt as a reward for working hard.

23 black and 18 yellow rat snakes,

327
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:19,571

Well done.

329
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:26,679

Good night.

331
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:32,134
Oh, right.

332
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:36,288
We should head back now.

333
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,624
Yes.

334
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:44,424
This trail is a lot worse than other restricted areas.

335
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,426
Not even herb collectors come here.

336
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:50,045
And since there are no humans, it's an animal paradise.

337
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:09,694
And… this is the only graveyard where you can see Cheonwangbong Peak.

338
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,664
Is this it?

339
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,324
Yes. This is the place.

340
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,223
Nothing, right?

341
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,795
Yeah… there is nothing.

342
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,755
Let's go down.

343

We've got a special patrol to do.

344
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,725
How come you came with me without a question?

You always yell at me for saying nonsense.

346

But today you came without a complaint.

350
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:47,505
Hurry up before it gets dark.

351
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,324
What if we get caught again?

352
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,135
How else will we pay the fine?

353
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:54,345
Are we going to starve the kids?

354
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,105
It's either do or die.

355
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,711
What are you doing?

356
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,862
You go that way.

357
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,813
How could such a graveyard still remain in a national park?

358
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,816
Aren't illegal properties subject to demolition here?

359
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,493
For the graves that were here before it became a national park,

360
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,054
families often don't agree to move them.

361
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,182
Like that one.

362
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:43,244
Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) is over, and the Cold Food festival's not here yet.

363
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:46,213
No one will come for a while, which means no injuries.

364
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,006
Not only families come here.

365
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,926
There are many animals around gravesites, too.

366
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:55,807
Especially, snakes are spotted a lot under a stone table.

367

369
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,067
Don't come up, Senior.

00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,094
Stay there!

371
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:18,591
A potato bomb?

372
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:19,717
That's right.

373
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:25,181
Homemade bombs were used by poachers who hunted Asian black bears in the sixties and seventies.

374
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:29,251
Bear livers and gallbladders had enormous monetary value back then.

375
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,462
So the poachers set them up here and there on Jirisan.

376
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,050
Kind of like a landmine.

377
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,176
But they're still on the mountain?

378
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,595
In the sixties, when the national park was established,

379
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,764
everyone, including the villagers, searched

380
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,724
and removed the remaining bombs.

381
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,928
But they couldn't reach the deep restricted trails.

382
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:50,856
This is Jirisan, after all.

383
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,085
But how did this old junk explode?

384
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,987
The casing of a potato bomb is entirely sealed with wax.

385
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,655
And because no wind or rain could get in,

386
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,750
the detonator and explosive must have remained inside.

387
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:07,097
We keep telling them not to enter that area but they do.

388
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,762
I have something to tell you.

389
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:19,418
We patrolled the site before the explosion.

390
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:25,599
We've looked all around for any dangerous objects.

391
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,762
But the bomb wasn't there at that time.

392
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:31,063
Is that true?

393
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,626
Yes.

394

Did you really look everywhere?

395
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:39,529
Maybe you confused it with grass or branch or something?

396
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,156
No.

397
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,134
There really was nothing then.

398
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,011
I'm positive.

399
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,321
Are you positively sure?

If you're not sure, this is a huge problem.

401

00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,725
Where's Yang Sun?

658
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,844
Yang Sun!

659
00:58:43,844 --> 00:58:45,687
If I had believed you from the beginning...

660
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,272
could we have saved her?

661
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,316
[Someone noticed our plan.]

662
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,401
It was one of the rangers.

663
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,320
You're the only one I can trust.

664
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,988
Can you help me?

665
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,920
I can prove that he's the criminal.

666
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,470
♫ I lost you ♫

667
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:06,020
♫ even I lost myself ♫

668
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,750
♫ I’m falling ♫
