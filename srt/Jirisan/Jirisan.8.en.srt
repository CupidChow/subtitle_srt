00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,500
Heads up!

167
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,109
- Everyone here?
- Yes!

168
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,364
Jangteomok, Seseok, Moojin, and Main Station teams stay here and draw firelines.

169
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,660
Haedong and Bidam teams go on-site and search for the missing people.

170
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,537
Our destination is the Gap Cave in Saemteo.

171
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,040
- Get on it!
- Yes, Sir!

172
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:58,670
♫ Last thing I wanted, hold me like you used to do ♫

173
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,426
Grab the hose!

174
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,300
♫ Be brave, time to face ♫

175
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,058
Watch out!

176
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,812
Tree falling in the 4:00 direction!

177
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:20,150
♫ Destiny, it’s all meant to be ♫

178
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,150
♫ I will never let you go, never let you fall ♫

179
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,287
Grab the hose!

180
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,570
Yes, sir!

181
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,178
Watch from behind!

182
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,836
Are you okay?

183
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,365
I'm fine.

184
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:57,474
This is the broadcast room.

185
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,494
The wind is gaining more speed. Are the firelines completed?

186
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:04,706
One-third of the firelines are drawn. How's the situation there?

187
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:08,593
200 meters to the Gap Cave in Saemteo.

188
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,829
Was there...

189
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:17,302
Was there anyone missing...?

190
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,251
Seo Yi Kang!

191
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:25,927
Is that you?

192
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:35,512
Seo Yi Kang speaking! I'm descending by the southwest slope of the pine tree habitat.

193
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:39,057
I'm 10 minutes away from the Gap Cave in Saemteo. I'll go check first!

194
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,277
Senior...

195
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:50,235
Three children in total. We'll be up soon!

196
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,528
Let's hurry. We don't have much time.

197
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:53,363
- Let's go at full speed!
- Yes, sir!

198
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:57,133
Moving forward! Keep moving!

199
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:02,597
Grab the hose!

200
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,228
Grab the hose!

201
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,621
Come on out. Let's go down together.

202
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,840
It's dangerous here with all the leaves.

203
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:45,142
Yi Kang!

204
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:47,527
Seo Yi Kang!

205
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,404
Seo Yi Kang!

206
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,907
Yi Kang!

207
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,827
Seo Yi Kang!

208
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,038
Yi Kang!

209
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,869
Seo Yi Kang!

210
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:11,134
Yi Kang!

211
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,121
Seo Yi Kang!

212
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,886
- Is she there?
- Answer me, Yi Kang!

213
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,313
- Where are you?
- Isn't she in there?

214
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,723
- No.
- Yi Kang, answer me!

215
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:28,926
- Get back!
- Watch out!

216
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,206
Put that out!

217
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,984
- You okay?
- Yeah.

218
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:47,954
- Goo Yeong.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you okay?

219
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:51,224
Sir...

220
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,920
Sir.

221
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,521
No, this is too dangerous.

222
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,474
We must go back.

223
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:06,106
Sir!

224
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:11,569
It's not possible to go any further.

225
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:43,240
Haedong-Bidam team.

226
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,690
Failed to find any survivors.

227
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:48,640
Returning to the fireline.

228
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,441
Over.

229
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,129
No way...

230
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,819
Sir, the fire equipment cabinet!

231
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,670
It was closed before,

232
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,710
but now it's open.

233
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,142
Kids! Hurry up and come out!

234
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,127
Hurry up!

235
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:53,546
Hurry!

236
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:19,823
It must be Yi Kang.

237
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:31,927
It's not that far to the equipment cabinet.

238
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:35,672
I'll go alone, you guys get back for now.

239
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:41,335
Sir!

240
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,806
What are you waiting for?

241
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,680
Proceed!

242
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,099
Yi Kang!

243
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,819
Seo Yi Kang!

244
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,491
- Seo Yi Kang!
- Yi Kang!

245
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,085
- Yi Kang!
- Yi Kang!

246
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,174
Be careful and sit.

247
00:30:18,391 --> 00:30:21,185
Is anyone hurt? Any injuries?

248
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,714
Good job, guys. Good work.

249
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,673
There they come!

250
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,747
That's a relief!

251
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,792
Gosh! Are they okay?

252
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,152
That's a relief.

253
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,201
They're okay.

254
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:03,068
- Step back.
- He's fine.

255
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,739
Dong Su! Dong Il!

256
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:09,951
Thank you!

257
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,386
Yi Kang!

258
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:22,146
- Are you all right?
- Good work, sir.

259
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,050
Good job.

260
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,087
Here.

261
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,888
Take her, please.

262
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,611
Are you all right?

263
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:40,715
Se Wook...

264
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,509
What did you say?

265
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:47,004
Se Wook was in the pine tree habitat.

266
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,359
We have to get her to the hospital right away.

267
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,161
Please step aside.

268
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,378
Get up.

269
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,171
Great work, Sir.

270
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,295
Want some water?

271
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,563
You inhaled a lot of smoke, but luckily your lungs are okay.

272
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:08,411
You have light burns here and there, but they're not severe.

273
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:13,574
We'll have to keep a close watch for a while,

274
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:18,470
but you can drink and eat.

275
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,665
You want water?

276
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,738
If not water, you want juice instead?

277
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,919
Someone came to visit

278
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,096
while you were asleep.

279
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,496
Stop right there!

280
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:46,449
The shot is to not make you sick.

281
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:48,768
It scared you?

282
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:51,287
Even your sister got it.

283
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,565
- I don't want to!
- I know.

284
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,200
Mommy will give you a piggyback.

285
00:33:58,361 --> 00:33:59,662
There.

286
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:31,540
She came by with the box of juice earlier.

287
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,438
She sends her thanks.

288
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:39,452
Are the other ones okay, too?

289
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:44,491
- You!
- Ow!

290
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:46,868
What on earth are you doing?

291
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:49,387
What's wrong with you? I'm a patient!

292
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:53,124
I sent you up there to save people, and you come back hurt?

293
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,461
- Stop it, go away!
- Calm down, please.

294
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,261
Stop right there!

295
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,290
How could you worry your old grandma like this?

296
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,928
Where is she? Come here right now!

297
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:08,629
Hey!

298
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,734
Did she leave?

299
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:22,962
She's no joke!

300
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:25,073
She fell asleep on your bed.

301
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:28,593
I was wondering who you took after. It's your grandma.

302
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,194
Quiet.

303
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:33,056
Drink up.

304
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:34,757
Thanks.

305
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:44,072
We found... Lee Se Wook's body.

306
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:48,012
All his articles were burned by the fire,

307
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,014
and it was impossible to do a DNA test,

308
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,435
but the teeth matched his dental records.

309
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:57,897
Considering that his skeleton was fractured here and there,

310
00:35:57,897 --> 00:36:02,977
the police concluded that he fell from the cliff and died.

311
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,415
Then... it's all over now.

312
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:22,130
These are the incidents you've been seeing.

313
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,181
Why did you write them down?

314
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,736
Why did I see only these cases?

315
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,764
What do you mean?

316
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:34,459
There have been 25 deaths that occurred

317
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:38,521
on Jirisan after Hyeon Su died.

318
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:43,117
But why did I only see these?

319
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:45,737
I looked into the 20 cases...

320
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,381
that I didn't foresee.

321
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:50,658
Except for Geum Rye, all the other cases were

322
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:54,762
simple accidents, or hikers who already

323
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:57,620
suffered from heart disease.

324
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:01,978
Then the ones you saw...?

325
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:04,355
Murders disguised as accidents.

326
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,893
That was the case with the poisoned yogurt drinks and potato bombs.

327
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:12,563
Other cases, too, most likely.

328
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:22,440
Here, an old rope on a restricted trail broke, carrying the lady with it.

329
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,825
I also saw the rope breaking.

330
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,786
Someone could have cut it on purpose in advance.

331
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,387
Same with the next case.

332
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,072
He was climbing a snowy mountain.

333

00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,443
There were footprints of two people.

Someone must have pushed the other from behind.

There was a hiking pole next to the cliff.

337
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:53,488
Someone must have tricked the man with it and pushed him from behind.

I asked him about the yogurt and potato bombs, which caught him off guard.

498
00:51:11,517 --> 00:51:13,603
you told me you saw before?

499
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,381
All herb collectors know about that ghost.

500
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:20,009
We all went up on a spiritless day since we're all scared of the ghost.

501
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:24,306
Whoever saw that ghost has died.

502
00:51:24,306 --> 00:51:29,242
So the story you told me before, it's really true?

503
00:51:29,242 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm serious.

504
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,106
Mr. Jang who died in Moojin Valley 3 months ago

505
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:34,716
also told me before he died

506
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:37,527
that he saw a man in a bloody uniform.

507
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:38,986
Not just him.

508
00:51:38,986 --> 00:51:44,867
Gi Yeong, who was going to his ancestral grave and died in Oerae Valley, also said he saw him.

509
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:49,038
And Mr. Hwang, who nearly died in Jeonmuk Valley because the rope broke,

510
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,708
saw him, too.

511
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,730
I saw a guy with a ranger's uniform.

512
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,900
His hands and clothes were covered in blood.

513
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:33,393
You had an accident in Jeonmuk Valley?

514
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:37,605
It was the road I took every day, but the rope broke and I nearly died.

515
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:41,692
If it weren't for the hiker passing by, I would have died.

516
00:53:41,692 --> 00:53:47,394
I heard you met someone in a uniform before the accident.

517
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,546
Was it him?

518
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,499
Who is this?

519
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,000
Do you know him?

520
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,560
Did you see this man?

521
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,104
It wasn't a man.

522
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:05,642
It was a ghost. A grim reaper.

523
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:12,411
Whoever saw that ghost... has died.

He came back to the mountain.

536
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:42,697
And suddenly people started dying.

537
01:00:42,697 --> 01:00:44,682
She's still on the mountain like Yi Kang said.

- Da Won!

539
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:47,952
Still no answer from the commander?

540
01:00:47,952 --> 01:00:49,536
Please check this...

541
01:00:49,536 --> 01:00:52,271
We found a pink cell phone. It's covered in blood.

542
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:54,124
Did she go missing trying to find that?

543
01:00:54,124 --> 01:00:56,627
Why did Da Won record that conversation?

544
01:00:56,627 --> 01:01:00,303
When you're stranded, you panic and do illogical things.

545
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:02,825
He said it wasn't him this time.

546
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,360
You shouldn't have come back.
