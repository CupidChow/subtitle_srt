160
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,114
Did he fall with his backpack?

No, we don't see the hiker.

It takes at least three hours to get there, even on sunny days.

He came to the mountain to kill himself.

That kid, came to the mountain to live.

321
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:27,443
He would surely have found a place like that.

322
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:18,243
Any progress?

323
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,147
I haven't found him yet.

324
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,165
He's nowhere to be seen.

325
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,834
I've looked in all the places you mentioned.

326
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,703
But he wasn't there.

327
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,425
He's still alive.

328
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,170
He must be here somewhere.

329
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,642
But where?

330
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,402
Those that want to live instinctively look for these places.

331
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,530
Where you can keep warm.

332
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,232
Between big rocks.

333
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,168
Senior, where are you?

334
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,460
What is it?

335
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,964
Have you seen a weird mark made with twigs and rocks?

336
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:13,881
No.

337
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,111
Something shaped square. Have you seen it?

338
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:18,595
I've never seen anything like that.

339
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,154
Why do you ask? Just look for the hiker.

340
00:43:21,154 --> 00:43:23,350
What about a black rock then?

341
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,518
What the heck?

342
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,353
There must be an oak tree nearby.

343
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:31,125
There were oak tree leaves scattered around.

344
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,809
What on earth…?

345
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:38,298
Do you mean Sangsuri Rock?

346
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:41,024
Is there such a place? Is it near here?

347
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,730
But that's outside the reception area.

348
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,289
He's there.

349
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,334
He's probably there.

350
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,542
Don't you get it?

351
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:53,547
If he's there, he couldn't have sent the text.

352
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,965
But we've looked everywhere else.

353
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,718
So, please,

354
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,396
let's make it our final place to look.

355
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,096
Senior, over here!

356
00:45:02,096 --> 00:45:03,517
Senior!

357
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,422
We found him!

358
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,475
The hiker found under Sangsuri Rock at Bidam Cliff!

359
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,163
His state of health?

360
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,933
Seo Yi Kang!

361
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,476
He's unconscious.

362
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,829
His body feels very cold.

363
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,897
His pulse and breathing?

364
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,733
Seung Hoon! Yeom Seung Hoon!

365
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,702
Seung Hoon, open your eyes! Wake-up.

366
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,060
Hey! Stop right there!

367
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,002
You all right?

368
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,078
I'll just carry him on my back.

369
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,813
Put him on my back.

370
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,546
Be careful.

371
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:21,837
Come down carefully.

372
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,147
Take your time!

373
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,240
Are you okay?

374
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,460
- Over here!
- There they are.

375
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,655
Check his vitals.

376
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,870
Pulse and breathing, normal.

377
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,614
Great!

378
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,949
Take the lady with you to the hospital.

379
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,693
Yes, Sir.

380
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,664
Take care of her.

381
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,242
See you in a bit.

382
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,548
We're at the bottom.

383
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,800
His pulse is normal, on the way to the hospital.

384
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,153
Come down safely.

385
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,455
Great work.

386
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,332
Thank you.

387
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,583
Where is Yi Kang?

388
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,011
She's probably passed out.

389
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,888
Well done, Yi Kang.

390
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,392
Why aren't you responding?

391
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,718
Hey, Yi Kang! Can you hear me?

392
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:44,106
Hey, Yi Kang!

393
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,830
Did she just turn it off?

394
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:52,910
♫ Our memories hold on to times of the past ♫

395
00:49:52,910 --> 00:50:00,000
♫ Something's gonna bring it to the air tonight.
Can't imagine my life without you ♫

396
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,590
♫ Something's gonna bring it to the air tonight.
Can't imagine my life without you ♫

397
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:10,910
♫ And when the world needs something, about to feel this way ♫

398
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:19,240
♫ When we were young, everything we did ♫

399
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:25,120
♫ When we were young, and wild and free ♫

400
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:31,530
♫ Tell me the truth, walk across to life ♫

401
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:36,190
♫ There's going to be everything I need ♫

402
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,117
Will you not spring yourself up here?

403
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,286
Aren't you going to train?

404
00:50:41,286 --> 00:50:45,174
In… just a sec… Let's rest a bit.

405
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:46,518
Are you here to play?

406
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:49,971
How can you save anyone at that pace?

407
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:52,548
If there is one thing that Jirisan is, is that it's big.

408
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,194
Stranded hikers will be dead while you rest like that.

409
00:50:56,194 --> 00:50:57,779
I think… I'm really dying.

410
00:50:57,779 --> 00:51:01,174
You got your patrol area assigned, right?

411
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:03,076
Have you been there?

412
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:04,477
No, not yet…

413
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,313
Our main task is to guard this mountain.

414
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:13,010
You must have all the place names, tree species, and distribution of vegetation memorized by heart.

415
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,154
Demon Seo…

416
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,639
Do you have a death wish?

417
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:20,059
No, Senior.

418
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:23,180
Even if I die…

419
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:27,617
Can I have a sip of water?

420
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,401
Yes. At Sohn Rock.

421
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,314
Okay. Coming.

422
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,141
Is this Sohn Rock?

423
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,394
Sohn, as in hand?

424
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:03,244
They're making it harder to go down.

425
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,580
Why would they have a date at such a tough place, not a pub?

426
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,142
That's so annoying.

427
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:13,563
Should I… hold your hand?

428
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,319
Shut up and follow me.

429
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,960
Wait… Slow down…

430
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,487
How did you find this place?

431
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,398
It wasn't me.

432
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:42,200
He did.

433
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,158
Newbie.

434
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,859
Yes?

435
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:46,454
How did you know about this place?

436
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,814
Well, umm…

437
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,445
Let's say… the mountain told me.

438
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:56,772
The mountain?

439
00:52:56,772 --> 00:52:59,049
That's believable.

440
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:03,220
People have been serving Jirisan from before the Three Kingdoms.
(Refers to the three kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla)

441
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,723
Being an object of faith for such a long time,

442
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,017
can't just be a superstition.

443
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:12,413
There's energy in this mountain that's difficult to explain.

444
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,957
That's what I mean.

445
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:16,150
This time, for instance,

446
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:20,362
there's no reception here, but a text message was sent.

447
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:24,158
- The mountain saved the kid.
- Ah.

448
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,579
Stop the nonsense.

449
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,831
So what? What is it, anyway?

450
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,817
Oh, that.

451
00:53:32,817 --> 00:53:34,692
This is...

452
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:37,397
how the red commies communicated with each other.

453
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:40,090
When they fell behind from their team or was out of contact,

454
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,586
they made a secret code like this to communicate.

455
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,447
That's still there?

456
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:49,433
They pick a spot that no one else will discover.

457
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,827
A place that won't be…

458
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,561
destroyed in the wind and rain.

459
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,646
Like this place.

460
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,107
What do those twigs signify?

461
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,650
It was to notify their location,

462
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,002
or so we assume.

463
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:03,722
I must go somewhere now.

464
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,620
Thank you for calling me.

465
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,390
See you later.

466
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,290
Wait a moment.

467
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:15,668
Here.

468
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,128
I'm Kim Sol, a cultural resources foundation researcher.

469
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:23,401
If you happen to find another historical place like this, please call me!

470
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:24,886
All right.

471
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,873
This must be quite valuable.

472
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,959
This here,

473
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:46,515
could be useful when we can't use radio or cellphones on the restricted trails.

474
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:49,618
It's perfect for signaling a lost hiker's location.

475
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,138
Look here, Senior.

476
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:58,352
Pretend these rocks are Bidam Cliff.

477
00:54:58,352 --> 00:55:00,338
Here…

478
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,717
Stick a twig in it.

479
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:12,125
See? It's right where Sangsuri Rock is.

480
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,479
Now tell me the truth.

481
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,782
How did you find this place?

482
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:33,170
I saw this place.

483
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,960
It's not my first time.

484
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,111
I keep seeing…

485
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:44,515
where missing hikers are on this mountain.

486
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,664
You really are crazy.
