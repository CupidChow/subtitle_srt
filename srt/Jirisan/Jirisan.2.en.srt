00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,160
A ribbon? The ones illegal hikers use?

164
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,144
Then, it must be in the restricted area.

165
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,022
There's one 4 km away from Moojin Valley.

166
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,130
It's got a great view, so hikers like to go there to take photos.

167
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,550
And it often gets foggy.

168
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,840
Moojin Valley?

169
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:17,172
Hey, isn't this your day off, too?

170
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:20,466
Are you on patrol for illegal hikers?

171
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,119
Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule!

172

That's what I want to ask you.

176
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,302
Do you have permission to be here?

177
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:12,580
Why do I need permission? I can go wherever I want.

Kang Hyun Jo, Haedong Ranger Station.

179
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,656
Didn't you know this area's restricted?

180
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:28,137
Come down with me. I'll guide you down the mountain.

181
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:30,290
It's your day off, right?

182
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,910
You're not wearing a uniform, climbing alone with no partner.

183
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,497
So don't mind me on your day off and do what you need to do.

184
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:40,032
I'll go down on my own.

185
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,068
This isn't your first time, huh?

186
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,070
You know so much about what we do.

187
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,131
You must have the need to stay away from our patrol quite often.

188
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:50,265
Illegal harvesting? Or poaching?

189
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,650
- It's not like that.
- Let me see your rucksack.

190
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,860
I said it's not like that!

191
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,472
Then, why are you here?

192
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:59,543
If you're collecting plants or hunting illegally,

193
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,939
it won't end at paying a fine.

194
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,400
Should I call the cops to get the answer?

195
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,981
I'm not here for hunting or for plants.

196
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,868
I'm here because there's something I need to find.

197
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:25,987
What is it?

198
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,148
A dead body.

199
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,887
A dead body?

200
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:43,388
Of my father who went missing a year ago.

201
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,383
I'm looking for his remains.

- Oh, that's enough.
- I wish you good health.

Oh, that's too much!

209
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,004
- Have some of these.
- Enjoy!

210
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:54,199
Let me know if you need more.

211
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,120
- Why are you looking around like that?
- Huh?

212
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,763
- What are you looking at?
- I ordered fish, but it's not here yet.

Whose ancestral rite is everyone all gathered for?

215
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:24,752
You know, the air current in Jirisan is blocked by the tall, rugged topography,

216
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:27,775
so it's prone to local torrential rainfall.

217
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,754
The summer of '95 was extremely severe.

218
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:34,132
Heavy torrential downpours of more than 200 mm overnight

219
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,601
caused the worst flood damage in the history of mountains.

220
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:41,330
Unfortunately, it was during the peak holiday season,

221
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,540
so many vacationers were there.

222
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,293
And many of the rescuers and volunteer rangers

223
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,838
who tried to save the vacationers also died or went missing.

224
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,050
Over 100 people were sacrificed.

225

Most of the villagers here received damage, too.

You've been a loner since you were young, what can you do?

Yes, and I plan to be one forever. So go away.

And don't stare at me like that. It's all in the past.

What's weird is that they're still having a drinking session down there.

247
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,738
But someone has to remember.

It's not like that for everyone.

There's a man who's been searching for his dead father for a year.

252
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:39,191
I met someone by the pine tree habitat that you told me about.

253
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,013
Here.

254
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,641
The name of the missing man is Hong Sang Gyu.

255
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,162
He was in huge debt after his business went down.

256
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,022
He had no transaction record because he had such bad credit.

257
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,660
And his phone was off, too, which made it hard to investigate.

258
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,447
They've checked all the trails in Jirisan just in case,

259
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,615
but because there was no evidence of him coming here,

260
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,869
the case was closed without a search.

261
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,541
The police gave up, and so did we, but the son didn't.

262
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:16,734
I… want to help him.

263
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:22,015
Why do you think the police closed the case a year ago? Because they're dumb?

264
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:25,988
No. It's because they weren't sure that he came to Jirisan.

265
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:29,183
He took a restricted path, so he wasn't on the security camera.

266
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,744
He said there was a high probability that his father entered through Moojin Valley.

267
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:35,397
Moojin Valley is over 7.5 km long.

How will you find him?

Just give up. And I'm warning you.

Don't go around restricted trails when you're not on duty.

272
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,680
The mountain is not so easy.

273
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,290
But, Senior...

274
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,477
You asked how I knew where Seung Hoon was.

275
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,906
I saw it.

276
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,276
The sign left by the "red commies."

277
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:05,080
Here we go again.

278
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:07,614
I saw it again this time.

279
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:11,868
The foggy area of Moojin Valley, the pine tree habitat.

280
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:15,371
Someone was lying down bleeding there.

281
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:20,884
If that was the man looking for his father, we should stop him.

282
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,466
How much did you drink down there?

283
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,685
Did they force you to drink for being a newbie?

284
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:35,214
I understand.

285
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,545
I know it's hard to believe.

286
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:43,047
Your grandma's been waiting. You should go back.

287
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,317
Sorry to bother you so early in the morning.

288
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,428
What do you mean you want to know about my father?

289
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:14,639
Someone told me…

290
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:21,562
That I need to know his purpose of visiting this mountain to find your father.

291
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:24,983
Are you saying you'll look for him?

292
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,484
That's what we do.

293
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,908
My father was in landscaping all his life.

294
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:40,418
He was obsessed with trees. Especially pine trees.

295
00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:44,385
That day, he said he was going to see the pine trees at the Wusong Cliff.

296
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:48,924
All right. Now I have the route. I'll look in that area.

297
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:52,285
Hang on. I'll come, too.

298
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:57,103
No. I told you yesterday. That area's forbidden to civilians.

299
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:00,059
I'll pay the fine if I have to.

300
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,978
This is for my father.

301
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:05,523
I get how you feel, but a no is a no.

302
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,650
I've been searching for over a year.

303
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,246
It'll save time if you know the areas I've already searched.

304
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:16,951
Soon, it'll be almost a year since he died.

305
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:20,180
I want to find him before then and at least prepare a memorial.

306
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,874
Please.

307
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:27,936
Please let me find his remains… with my own hands.

308
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,850
Oh, no way.

309
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,011
Those things are impossible.

310
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:36,637

311
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:38,781

00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:06,733
- Is that a lottery ticket?
- Yup.

319

My goodness...

00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:15,475
You're too loud.

321
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,954
This headache...

322
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,890
I'm going to die from this raging headache.

323
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:28,796
Hello?

324
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:43,854
Ugh, I'm so hungover.

325
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,274
Hello?

326
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,417
- Please come see.
- Miss.
[Bidam Shelter]

327
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,395
It went flying that way, over there.

328
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:10,928
Miss, that's not what rangers do.

329
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:12,942
But, Mister!

330
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:15,036
Hey, get out!

331
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,836
Mister! It was for 1.4 billion won! (US$1.5 million)

332
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:20,648
- What? 1.4 billion(US$1.5 million)?
- Whoa!

333
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,202
Quick! Let's run!

334
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:25,602
- Oh, no, look at them.
- Run.

335
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:27,606
It's mine! It's mine!

336
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,483
- Hey!
- Help me!

337
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:33,478
Let's go down just once.

338
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,484
What is it? What happened?

339
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:53,316
A lottery ticket's flying around in Jirisan.

340
00:34:53,316 --> 00:34:54,801
A lottery ticket?

341
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:59,806
Bidam One. Mandong Valley. Too many illegal hikers here.

342
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,325
Wusong One. 500m to Mandong Valley.

343
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:05,369
You can't go in there, mister!

344
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,748
Come out, come out. It's dangerous there.

345
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:11,775
You'll fall and break your skull.

346
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,985
Isn't that it, Na Hoon?

347
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,762
- Is that it?
- Did you find it?

348
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:25,340
Where?

349
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,107
I swear I saw it!

350
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:32,045
What a sight.

351
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:37,592
Why are there so many people?

352
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,237
The news must have spread.

353
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,306
The hikers from Jangteomok and Cheonwangbong Peaks all came.

354
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,059
We're busy enough that it's Sunday.

355
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,846
It's 1.4 billion (US$1.5 million). I would jump in, too.

356
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,416
Whoa, 1.4 billion (US$1.5 million) you said!

357
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:57,135
I'll say this as a team leader… How can a ranger say that?

358
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,881
I'm so tired of this…

359
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:00,299
You did nothing to be tired.

360
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:02,476
Found it!

361
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:05,888
I found it!

362
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:09,814
- It's here.
- Really?

363
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,526
I got it.

364
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:23,660
How did you find it so quickly? You're awesome.

365
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,941
Return it to the owner.

366
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:33,020
- Yi Kang, this is…
- Return it to the owner.

367
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,195
Wow, it's 1.4 billion (US$ 1.5 million)!

368
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,381
I want to keep it.

369
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,157
All right, everyone!

370
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:47,243
You've violated Article 28 Clause 1 of the National Parks Act regarding restricted areas.

371
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:50,198

372
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:52,852
Block them.

373
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:55,862
I just got here.

374
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,416
Line up.

375
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:07,550
Let me slide just this time.

376
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,061
Why only me?

377
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:15,232
Excuse me. Where do you think you're going?

378
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,150
I need to check your bag.

379
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,803
Well, I…

380
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:31,098
Didn't you know this is an endangered plant?

381
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:33,833
I just saw it, and… Please let me off just this once.

382
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,653
Your ID, please.

383
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,196
Where's the newbie? Isn't he here?

384
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,448
I can't reach him on his cellphone.

385
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:50,159
Maybe he went to Moojin Valley.

386
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,368
What?

387
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:56,006
He asked me for the entire year's worth of documents on it earlier.

388
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:59,768
Moojin Valley, in the fog… The pine tree habitat.

389
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:02,846
Someone was lying there bleeding.

390
00:38:10,846 --> 00:38:12,773
Is it that tree?

391
00:38:13,516 --> 00:38:16,043
Yes. That's the one.

392
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,230
It is a dangerous topography. Chances are he lost his footing.

393
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,350
You're right. I searched long and hard for a year under the cliff.

394
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,475
But he could have run into danger while coming up here or going down.

395
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,002
What made you so sure it was here?

396
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,819
If he were to commit suicide… I thought it would be here.

397
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,750
He'd been talking about ending his difficult life,

398
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,730
ever since he went bankrupt.

399
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:54,064
I'm sure we'll find him this time.

400
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:57,384
Stay strong.

401
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,773
Hey, it's me.
[Police]

402
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,694
Was there anything reported from Moojin Valley today?

403
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:09,530
No, there hasn't. Did something happen?

404
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,132
No, it's fine.

405
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:15,911
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

406

Wow… Siberian ginseng, mushrooms… It's a riot.

- Thanks.
- Another newbie?

00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:26,005
Yes, introduce yourself.

00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:28,974
Get me some ice water.

411
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,221
Is this a newbie season? They're everywhere I go.

412
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:39,250
Oh yeah. How's the one who's partnered with Yi Kang?

413
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:43,836
He's tall. Slightly less attractive than me.

414
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,650
Is that even human?

415
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,145
I've never seen anyone taller than me, until now.

416
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,474
That was funny!

417
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:58,535
Hello? How's this?

418
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:03,024
Hey, Yi Kang. Nice work today.

419
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,818
When are you off? Do you want to have dinner together?

420
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,050
A year ago.

421
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,464
Someone named Hong Sang Gyu went missing in Jirisan.

422
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:11,925
Do you remember him?

423
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,451
Hong Sang Gyu? Sure.

424
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:17,764
His daughter stopped by last week and asked if we found him yet.

425
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,874
His children are really trying.

426
00:40:19,874 --> 00:40:22,919
I heard his son's looking for him in the mountain, too.

427
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,171
Son?

428
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,980
He doesn't have a son.

429
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:29,993
He only has one daughter.

430
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,650
- Why are you asking?
- See?

431
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,900
He only has a daughter.

[9. Fraud: Kim Gi Chang (33, male)]
[Please help us arrest him by reporting if anyone sees him.]

434
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:56,536
Over there, under the pine tree habitat where we met.

435
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:58,337
Near the pebbly road.

436
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:00,306
From there to the small waterfalls.

437
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:02,701
I've searched them all.

438
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,647
You've searched mainly near waterways.

439
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:10,108
If it is not under the cliff,

440
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:12,969
I thought he could have been swept away by the water.

441
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:18,851
These are the files on Moojin Valley since he went missing,

442
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,145
on August 10th of last year up until now.

443
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,063
The day after he went missing on the 11th,

444
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,667
there was a very heavy downpour of over 390 mm.

445
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,627
Yes, I remember.

446
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,055
That's why I couldn't come.

447
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:37,970
This is the satellite image of the time he went missing.

448
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:41,924
And this one's after the rainfall was over.

449
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,178
The direction of the water changed.

450
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:48,938
That's why I couldn't find him.

451
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:51,224
That's right.

452
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:53,927
You are different from the other rangers.

453
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:57,238
So we can just search around the waterway here, huh?

454
00:41:57,238 --> 00:42:01,367
For now, my safest bet

455
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,061
is this area.

456
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,256
Please go down first and search this area.

457
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,626
And you?

458
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:13,230
I must search another potential area.

459
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,198
That cliff.

460
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,512
He could have got caught along the way when he fell.

461
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:23,473
This is a restricted trail, so no cell phone signals work here.

462
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:27,160
I'll meet you at the point on the GPS in an hour.

463
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,620
Okay.

464
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,457
One second.

465
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:36,261
What was your father

466
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,714
wearing on that day?

467
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:44,435
A green windbreaker with grey pants.

468
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,228
And… a black rucksack.

Are you Mr. Hong Sang Gyu's daughter?

474
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,660
Yes. So what?

475
00:45:23,779 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm from the national park.

476
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,749
I heard that your father was in landscaping.

477
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:41,145
Did he bring this pine tree as well?

478
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:43,940
I don't know anything.

479
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:52,557
A pine tree can't grow like that on plain land.

480
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:54,759
Because there's no wind.

481
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:57,895
It must endure a long time

482
00:45:57,895 --> 00:46:00,523
up in a mountain, on a windy cliff

483
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:03,526
to have spectacular branches like that.

484
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:17,148
It requires a great sacrifice to dig out a tree illegally like this.

485
00:46:20,752 --> 00:46:22,904
Because you need to chop down

486
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,673
hundreds of trees to make a path

487
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:28,676
and drag the pine tree down.

488
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:41,647
It takes years and years for destroyed nature to recover,

489
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:45,176
but the illegal diggers don't care.

490
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:50,123
Such rare pine trees exceed a hundred million won (US$85,000).

491
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,563
On the day he went missing,

492
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,859
did he go up because of a pine tree?

493
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,629
Why didn't you tell us then?

494
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:08,358
We could have started searching then.

495
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,240
Dad didn't do that because he wanted to.

496
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,078
But loan sharks came and used violence every day.

497
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:23,723
Mom was sick, so we needed money.

498
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,969
Dad had a hard time with the job,

499
00:47:29,488 --> 00:47:33,073
because he loved trees.

500
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:36,402
But this was the only way.

501
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:40,198
He told me not to tell anyone.

502
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:43,168
That he'd go to jail if anyone found out.

503
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:48,064
That's why I couldn't even tell the police.

504
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:51,509
Because they would have asked why, if I told them he went to the mountains.

505
00:47:55,572 --> 00:48:02,178
Are you saying if I'd told the truth back then…

506
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:07,320
we could have found him?

507
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:11,654
If he didn't want to do this,

508
00:48:11,654 --> 00:48:15,391
then did someone lure him in?

509
00:48:16,702 --> 00:48:20,613
Who was that person?

510
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:28,112
I've checked all those places, but there was nothing.

511
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:30,381
How about the cliff?

512

He wasn't there either.

His name's Kim Gi Chang.

521
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,920
He was an evil man.

522
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:57,591
He only used the fact that my dad knew about pine trees, and didn't really pay him.

523
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:00,789
He came to see those pine trees a few times after my dad went missing.

524
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,844
Then he stopped coming, so I thought it was weird.

It was in the high of 39℃ when Hong Sang Gyu went missing.

He must have been in short sleeves when he left home.

He must have put on the windbreaker at the top of the mountain.
