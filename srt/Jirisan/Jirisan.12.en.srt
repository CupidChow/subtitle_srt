No one knew it would be raining that much on that day.

168
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:33,490
They just happened to be there and made an unfortunate choice.

169
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,120
It's all coincidence on top of coincidence.

170
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,737
And today's the same.

171
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:48,491
Anyone can get into an accident and die on the mountain.

172
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:51,480
No one knows what will happen.

173
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,192
I found it.

174
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,754
I found it!

175
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,686
Who are you?

176
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,144
Are you all right?

177
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,189
See?

178
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:06,842
If we had cable cars, this accident wouldn't have happened to us.

179
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,564
How can you say that in this situation?

180
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:13,242
If cable car construction started, and all trees were cut down,

181
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,579
we would have all died.

182
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:21,125
We only survived because the trees blocked the landslide.

183
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,462
Trees can be planted again.

184
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:26,647
Seriously.

185
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:29,701
Do you think trees are Lego blocks?

186
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,464
It can't be reversed by planting some trees.

187
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:37,826
Same as a village.

188
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:45,346
That town down there is where I was born and raised.

189
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:51,050
But more and more people are leaving.

190
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:57,662
When everyone leaves one by one,

191
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:00,390
the whole village will vanish.

192
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,405
If you care so much about your hometown, how could you do such a thing?

193
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,499
It's him! The cable car man.

194
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,928
You'll all absolutely regret this.

195
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,764
Black Bridge Village is gone because of you.

196
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,966
I'm not leaving!

197
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:30,020
You've taken a hometown away from its villagers.

198
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,015
I said I'm not the one

199
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,218
who put the dead animal in the well.

200
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:40,005
I swear.

201
00:20:56,022 --> 00:21:01,459
Senior, I don't think this is the way to Fox Hill.

202
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,621
The victim wouldn't be where the landslide happened.

203
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:08,767
They would have gone somewhere else even if they got injured.

204
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,185
To where?

205
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,563
Where there's an emergency repeater.

206
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,485
The repeater temporarily amplifies the terminal signal,

207
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,570
connecting it to the base station.

208
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,241
In other words, you'll be able to use a cell phone.

209
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,411
That phone won't work.

210
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,315
Sir!

211
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:44,727
- Are you all right?
- Yi Kang.

212
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,740
What happened?

213
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,996
He's been bleeding for a while. We need 119.

214
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,736
He's too cold! I think it's a hemorrhagic shock.

215
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,486
Haedong One, current location Clown Rock.

216
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,499
We have a critical victim here. Can we get 119, please?

217
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,159
Site of road damage.

218
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,411
We're approaching via an alternative route.

219
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,455
Apricot Tree Valley, proceeding with rescue.

220
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,850
Strong wind is slowing down the process.

221
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,757
Is the rescue at Beom Rock done?

222
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,359
Yes, sir.

223
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,885
- Over here.
- Yes, right here!

224
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,317
- 911 Please!
- Coming!

225
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:50,534
Well done.

226
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:55,206
Goo Yeong. Another SOS reported at Clown Rock, Moojin Valley.

227
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,909
Can you make it?

228
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,080
Yes. I'll leave now.

229
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,917
Gu Ho and Jin Hyung, come with me.

230
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,338
- What a day.
- Let's go.

231
00:23:19,307 --> 00:23:22,691
Yi Kang, 119 is on its way.

232
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,345
Kang Hyun Jo, you put him on your back.

233
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,945
I'll assist Hyun Jo down and join the support team.

234
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,090
You stay with him.

235
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,850
- I'll come, too.
- No. No.

236
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,594
We must get down as quickly as possible

237
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,264
since he's in a bad state.

238
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,592
Radio me if anything happens.

239
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,560
Be careful.

240
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,854
There will be another 119 team. Please wait here.

241
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,605
I can go down, too.

242
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,308
I must go down with them.

243
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:09,838
I'll come, too! I can make it!

244
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:12,208
Hold on.

245
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,993
Not with those legs.

246
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,079
There's a cave not far away. Let's wait there.

247
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,981
But...

248
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:41,353
Help! Help!

249
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,757
Over here!

250
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:46,768
Wait. Did you hear that?

251
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,820
Help me!

252
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,656
Over here!

253
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,618
On the cliff!

254
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,773
Over here! Save me!

255
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:01,358
Are you okay?

256
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:02,959
Yes!

257
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:08,240
Jung Goo Yeong speaking. We found a stranded hiker

258
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,642
1.5 km from Moojin Valley, on the southwest cliff.

259
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:15,905
We don't have the gear to rescue her from our side.

260
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:21,736
Is any support team available?

261
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,091
Apricot Tree Valley is still in the process of rescuing.

262
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,969
Ranger A Team joined the Chief on their way to Jingye Town at the damaged road.

263
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:33,164
Since the only way to get there is a detour, it'll take more than 5 hours for the rescue.

264
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,520
Will you be okay by yourself?

265
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,388
You're going to go by yourself?

266
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:45,569
Dong Hyup, get ready to go up with me.

267
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:46,945
Yes, Sir.

268
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,088
I'll go.

269
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,992
You must keep watch here.

270
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:59,755
I know you don't trust me, but I've been training

271
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:01,901
with Senior Goo Yeong for months.

272
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,090
I can do this. Please let me go up.

273
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,831
Support team just left. It'll take about 2 hours.

274
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,500
Okay.

275
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,754
- Can you hear me?
- Yes!

276
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,091
Rangers with gear will come to rescue you!

277
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,244
It'll take a couple of hours.

278
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:39,539
Please don't worry and wait patiently!

279
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:44,769
Okay!

280
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,980
All right!

281
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,741
Let's go.

282
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,735
Are you hurt anywhere else?

283
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:41,434
You should watch out for hypothermia on a rainy mountain.

284
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,842
Let me know if you need anything else.

285
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:04,832
What... is that sound?

286
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,394
Sounds like a landslide.

287
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,847
A landslide?

288
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:13,607
Jirisan mostly consists of soil.

289
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,594
Heavy rain can easily lead to a landslide

290
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,446
because the soil holds water.

291
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,866
Then this place can collapse, too.

292
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,993
Let's go down. Quick.

293
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,415
Don't worry. This is safe because it consists of bedrock.

294
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:31,750
Don't lie.

295
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,505
That's what they said then, too, but the whole building was swept away.

296
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,842
What are you saying?

297
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,475
The building was swept away after we left.

298
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,506
You mean...

299
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,775
Dowon Valley in 1995?

300
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,899
Yes.

301
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:28,016
Those who left all survived,

302
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:38,234
but those who stayed behind all died.

303
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:46,834
I can't die here. I must leave.

304
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:49,429
- It's dangerous.
- Move!

305
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:51,047
Watch out!

306
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,053
Watch out!

307
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,573
The trees are leaning. They can fall. It's dangerous.

308
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,250
- Let's go back.
- Move out of the way!

309
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,644
When there's a flood,

310
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,062
you must stay and wait for rescue! That's the protocol.

311
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,839
Didn't you hear what I said?

312
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:20,901
They didn't die because they stayed.

313
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,529
They just made a choice.

314
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,822
And it happened to be an unfortunate one.

315
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,865
No, no, no. They gave up on them.

316
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,644
Because they were scared.

317
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,329
- They gave up!
- No!

318
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,107
They got scared and gave up.

319
00:30:56,062 --> 00:31:00,899
How many times did I tell you not to stand surety for anyone?

320
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,137
He didn't mean to...

321
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:06,723
Whatever. Enough.

322
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,600
So what are you going to do now?

323
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,643
You even got the house confiscated.

324
00:31:11,643 --> 00:31:14,621
So what's the plan for the future?

325
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,727
It's frustrating.

326
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,481
Your son and daughter-in-law had life insurance.

327
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:00,901
Here's the list of the payables

328
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:03,529
and the non-payables.

329
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,951
Please check their identification

330
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,244
and the insurance period.

331
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:14,540
But in cases of deaths from disasters, there are some steps to take.

332
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,520
You might not get the benefit,

333
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,276
if it was suicide.

334
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:28,587
A what...?

335
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,868
- When the police are done with investigations...
- No!

336
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:38,339
My parents...

337
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,651
They didn't do that.

338
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:45,404
My mom and dad...

339
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:49,658
would never do that and leave me.

340
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,216
Switch! Switch!

341
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,960
I'll take him!

342
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,345
Hurry up!

343
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:12,532
There's one more, near Clown Rock.

344
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,452
I'll go up.

345
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,622
Senior Yi Kang.

346
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:24,904
Senior Yi Kang, can't you hear me?

347
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,715
Kang Hyun Jo! You all right?

348
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:31,335
I can't reach Senior Yi Kang.

349
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,844
It must be because of the rain clouds.

350
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:35,698
We'll go up. You head down first.

351
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,189
Kang Hyun Jo!

352
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,940
Are you okay?

353
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,539
I'm sorry.

354
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:21,043
You were right. The mud collapsed.

355
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:28,159
Had I gone down, I would have died.

356
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:43,274
I came here... to die.

357
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:50,639
My business failed and my family's long scattered.

358
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:56,979
I had no reason to live so I came to the mountain to die.

359
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,641
I visited that place for the last time.

360
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,955
Then I realized I wanted to live.

361
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,845
The pagoda ground in Baekto Valley...

362
00:36:22,538 --> 00:36:27,949
That was when I first came to Jirisan in 1995.

363
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:40,363
Wow. I didn't know places like this existed.

364
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:40,989
Right?

365
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,575
It's beautiful here.

366
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,505
Hey.

367
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,583
Let's ask them to take a picture of us.

368
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,320
One, two, three.

369
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,040
One, two, three.

370
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:17,150
It'll turn out well since you're all so good looking.

371
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,818
Thank you.

372
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,038
Have you eaten yet?

373
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:25,818
We brought rice balls. Would you like some?

374
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:29,079
Sure, thank you.

375
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,756
Of course.

376
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,417
- Eat lots.
- Thank you.

377
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:37,212
- Are the three of you friends?
- Yes.

378
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:39,489
Not dating one another?

379
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,533
Oh, no way.

380
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,453
That's a real no.

381
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,066
- You came for a hike?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,294
Isn't it beautiful here?

383
00:37:57,383 --> 00:38:00,661
Does that really grant your wish?

384
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,682
How long do you think this place existed?

385
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:08,101
I don't know. How long?

386
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,978
I don't know either.

387
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,357
Apparently, people have been piling stone pagodas here since a long ago.

388
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:17,527
Sometimes the flood sweeps everything away,

389
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:21,765
but they get piled up again like magic.

390
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:27,245
If it's been a popular wishing spot for this long,

391
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,790
maybe there's a reason.

392
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:34,711
What did you wish for?

393
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,037
I wished to become a good father.

394
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:49,151
The fact that you're wishing that already proves you're a good father.

395
00:38:50,186 --> 00:38:55,507
A good father doesn't ruin the whole family by standing surety.

396
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,947
I'm all right.

397
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:08,979
I can stand strong again as long as I have my family.

398
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,274
I'm sure of it.

399
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:23,544
I thought of that man.

400
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:28,014
"I can stand strong again...

401
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:30,442
as long as I have my family..."

402
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:39,334
- Senior Yi Kang!
- Seo Yi Kang!

403
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:41,612
They are here!

404
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,572
Are you all right?

405
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,735
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

406
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,704
Jung Goo Yeong speaking.

407
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:53,665
We found the stranded in the cave behind Clown Rock.

408
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:56,359
We'll descend.

409
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,646
- Can you get up?
- Yes.

410
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,356
This way, please.

411
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,649
That's right.

412
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,276
- Watch your step. It's slippery.
- Okay.

413
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:08,805
- Be careful.
- Confirmed!

414
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,891
Are you all right?

415
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:15,863
What happened? Are you hurt?

416
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:25,690
No one knew...

417
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:30,269
why my parents went to the mountain on that day.

418
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:35,791
They left without a word to Grandma or me.

419
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,451
These flowers represent happiness.

420
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,468
Here you go.

421
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,306
I don't need stuff like this.

422
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,244
Why are you so angry?

423
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,206
You like mountains.

424
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:20,460
I said I like mountains, not to live on them.

425
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,489
I have no friends here.

426
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,511
I want to go to Seoul!

427
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,348
There's no one there.

428
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:36,117
Your mom and dad are here. Let's stay here together.

429
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:37,327
No!

430
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,982
I hate mountains, I hate you and Mom and everything else.

431
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,656
People wondered out loud

432
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:18,853
if they went to the mountain and died

433
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:22,348
to leave me insurance benefits.

434
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:31,390
I denied it,

435
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,603
and told me they'd never do that to me.

436
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,058
But...

437
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:49,080
What if they made that choice,

438
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,079
because of what I had said to them.

439
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,044
I was scared if that was the case.

440
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:05,532
I wanted to forget.

441
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,733
Are you sure you don't want to leave a note?

442
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,318
Yes.

443
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,247
We'll survive and tell her ourselves.

444
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,830
All of us will survive.

445
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,278
But...

446
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,568
I can't forget anything anymore.

447
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,897
I miss them even more.

448
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:31,002
I miss my parents so much.

449
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,332
I miss them so bad...

450
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,548
Be careful, it's slippery.

451
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:46,953
- It stopped raining.
- That's good.

452
00:46:46,953 --> 00:46:51,530
Oh, I saw a girl up there a while back.

453
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,093
Huh?

454
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:58,523
I found it!

455
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,303
Who are you?

456
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:05,313
Are you all right?

457
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,767
Go away.

458
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,861
I mean, are you okay?

459
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:15,314
Don't come near me.

460
00:47:15,314 --> 00:47:18,543
Go away!

461
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,130
Hey!

462
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,450
You forgot...

463
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:29,062
You forgot this!

464
00:47:29,062 --> 00:47:32,181
Take this!

465
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:34,050
Ouch!

466
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:46,305
What the heck?

467
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:49,316
They said someone would come but where are they?

468
00:48:21,423 --> 00:48:23,858
It hurts!

469
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:27,036
My lottery...

470
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,332
It's all wet!

471
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:42,460
You're my life.

472
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:54,631
We're from the national park!

473
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,100
Hello?

474
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,227
Over here!

475
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:04,073
I'm right here!

476
00:49:04,073 --> 00:49:07,401
- Over here!
- We're from the national park!

477
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:09,011
- Over here!
- Hello?

478
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:12,524
Over here! I'm here!

479
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:23,843
- Over here!
- Over here!

480
00:49:23,843 --> 00:49:27,280
- Be careful!
- Be very careful.

481
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,467
- Oh god.
- Ma'am!

482
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,951
Get me out of here.

483
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:34,153
Wait up!

484
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:40,701
Help me!

485
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:49,093
Chief.

486
00:49:49,093 --> 00:49:51,637
Yang Geun Tak arrived at the hospital.

487
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:55,058
His condition improved so he underwent an operation.

488
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,187
Maybe I shouldn't have saved him.

489
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,750
Rescue at the damaged road has been completed.

490
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,554
Great work, Fire Chief.

491
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,347
Well done, guys.

492
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,307
Did you finish everything okay?

493
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,686
Everyone from Beom Rock, Apricot Tree Valley, and Stone Chamber were rescued safely.

494
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,197
We're lucky this year.

495
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,822
Go ahead.

496
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,425
- Gosh.
- Be careful.

497
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:38,743
Ma'am!

498
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,162
What brings you here?

499
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,523
What do you think?

500

What? What's this? Are you eating without us?

Hello.

535
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,249
We briefly met up there.

536
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,886
I'm Kang Hyun Jo, a national park ranger.

537
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,381
I want to ask you something.

538
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,800
What is it?

539
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,847
I heard you were in the office building during the flood in 1995.

540
00:53:47,248 --> 00:53:49,267
Yes. What about it?

541
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,859
Do you remember them?

542
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,281
Well... I'm not sure.

543
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,577
They were in the office building with you.

544
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,082
They would have been with the volunteer firefighters.

545
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,420
I think there were people like them there.

546
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,881
Why do you ask about them?

547
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:25,302
Did anything, in particular, happen to them?

548
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,013
Maybe an argument

549
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,642
or a common interest or agreement?

550
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,394
I'm not too sure.

551
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,791
It was a situation of life and death.

552
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:40,068
All I remember is we escaped the building together.

553
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:46,346
But...I don't think they fought.

554
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,877
Have you seen Yang Sun?

555
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,754
No, I haven't.

556
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,825
- Have you seen Senior Yang Sun?
- No.

557
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,264
We can just walk down and take the bus.

- She mobilized.
- What?
