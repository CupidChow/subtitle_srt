I still don't get what happened then.

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,020
Why did you climb the mountain that day?

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:07,107
What on earth happened to you and Hyun Jo?

6
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,277
We only tried to protect the mountain.

7
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,820
Because that was our job.

8
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,948
I heard you're a legendary ranger in your time.

9
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,784
Is there anything I can do to help?

10
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,595
We could search together.

11
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,537
At the 4 kilometer point in Dowon Valley,

12
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:25,350
there's an old oak tree behind Mangbawi Rock.

13
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,062
There should be a rotten root base at the bottom.

14
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,732
Can you make this mark there?

15
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:33,175
Yi Kang, when did you return?

16
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,961
I came to ask you something.

17
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,905
Do you know anything about this case?

18
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:40,766
Isn't this that Yang Geun Tak guy who was found recently?

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,934
What about this yellow ribbon?

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,853
Why are you asking about the ribbon?

21
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,565
I found a spot for you at the headquarters in Wonju.

22
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,892
But I…

23

Go to the headquarters.

24
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:54,238
When I got injured here before,

25
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:56,049
there were yellow ribbons.

26
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,700
If they belonged to the illegal hikers,

27
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,954
wouldn't they lead to the top of the mountain?

28
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,889
But not those ribbons.

29
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:08,458
They tied them another way, not to the top.

30
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,619

31

No, you did a great job.

51

No, not that I know of.

Do you know what that bell is for?

54
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:19,287
Apparently, there are 28 other worlds

besides the one we're living in.

the ghost world opens up beyond the world that humans live.

58

167
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,734
You should be doing your homework instead.

168
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,535
All right?

169
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,329
Don't fall! You'll break your skull.

170
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,831
And that would hurt a lot.

171

- Be careful.

172

What's going on?

173
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,963
It's a royal command. A royal command.

174
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,856
What's going on?

175
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,216
Jeez.

176
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,490
The stretch exercises didn't help.

177
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,301
Let's wrap it up quickly and go down.

178
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,144
Team Leader!

179
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,182
- Well done.
- You wretch!

180
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:05,873
You've violated the legislation.

181
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:07,559
- There will be a 100,000 won (US $800.00) fine.
- You wretch!

182
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,027
That's per person.

183
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,570
You know what happens if you don't pay it right away.

184
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,073
There's a late charge if you don't pay it quickly.

185
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,621
Are you all right?

186
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,939
You're destined to roam the mountains even when you're dead.

187
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,507
What?

188
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,233
What was with that kid?

189
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:05,934
What's that?

190
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,811
I've never seen this kind of talisman before.

191
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,188
I'll have to take it and do some research.

192
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:13,065
People like these must come here often?

193
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:16,235
You know the expressions in Korean, "go to a valley" or "will send you to a valley?"

194
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:17,945
Have you heard them before?

195
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:19,865
"Gone to a valley…"

196
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:25,454
It originated from here because of the belief no one walks out of this Baekto Valley alive.

197
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:28,731
This place has especially strong yin energy, even for Jirisan.

198
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,832
The Donghak Peasant Revolution.

199
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:30,892
The Japanese Invasion.

200
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,753
The Korean War and the battle with the mountain Red Commies.

201
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:35,922
Many people died here for a period of time.

202
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,409
Even to this day, we find human bones when we dig the soil.

203
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:46,600
There are many places in the Baekto Valley with a cross or stone pagoda.

204
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,854
They're for those who died without a grave.

205
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:55,766
If ghosts exist, this is the place that suits them.

206
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,355
That's why these shamans come here to get energy.

207
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,218
This place had such a history...

208
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,746
If ghosts exist...

209
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,565
If there's something...

210
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:13,459
This is the place more than any other...

211
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,999
Thank you!

212
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,333

Where to?

219

Gamnamu (Persimmon Tree) Restaurant would be ideal…

220

No. If grandma joins us, it'll be all night.

221
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:46,492
Then, the residence?

222
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,060
Sure. Okay.

223
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,579
What are they saying?

224
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,706
What do you think?

225
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,141
We have to drink to chase the ghosts away.

226
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:56,937
Oh… What about Senior Sol then?

227
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:59,981
She doesn't want to drink the ghosts off.

228
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,493
Do you mean he was the top entrance this year?

229
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,762
Yeah.

230
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:08,615
Jirisan's so wide and rough, everyone avoids coming here.

231
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:11,417
But they were shocked that the top of the class volunteered to come.

232
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,937
Wow. He's the total opposite of Yi Kang.

233
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,830
She was the lowest. At the bottom.

Actually, that's true.

the lowest score in the history of the national park service.

Ugh, seriously.

246

how did you become a ranger if you hated mountains so much?

I'll tell you…

262
00:22:56,224 --> 00:23:00,628
how I became a ranger.

Listen carefully.

When I was eight…

270
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:34,237
I brought a coca-cola and drank it there.

271

I then... started climbing the mountain.

272

Ask the police for cooperation, too.

330
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,794
What are you doing?

331
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:23,921
There's a signal here.

332
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:28,108
If she's near, we'll hear her phone.

333
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,174
It might be on vibrate mode.

334
00:30:35,174 --> 00:30:36,517
Let's split and search some more.

335
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:39,103
You take the side road.

336
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,938
Wait.

337
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:45,606
Baekto Valley, stone pagoda ground. Can we search there?

338
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:49,061
Why? Are you seeing false images again?

339
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:50,889
What did you see?

340
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,539
Did you believe in the Seven Wonders of the World as a child?

341
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,527
Just because you don't get them doesn't mean they're lies.

342
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,355
The pyramids, the Easter Island Moai statutes, the Bermuda Triangle…

343
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:09,217
Those things all exist...

344
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:11,310
What nonsense...

345
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,264
Never mind.

346
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:19,026
If you don't trust me, I'll go alone.

347
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,234
Hey!

348
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,602
What?

349
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:30,211
Wrong way.

350
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:36,894
Follow me.

351
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,362
I found nothing.

352
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,005
You?

353
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:34,435
I saw it for sure. It was right here.

354
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,959
I shouldn't have trusted you.

355
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,819
I'm serious. It was here.

356
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,437
Whatever.

357
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,824
Are you the national park staff?

358
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,885
Yes, we're from Haedong Ranger Station.

359
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:19,263
We were informed about your march.

360
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,063
Captain Kang…?

361
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:25,652
Is that you?

362
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,881
It's been a while...

363
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,313
Is Granny back yet?

364
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,814
She hasn't come back yet.

365
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,751
She didn't go to a friend's either.

366
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:52,547
Have you checked the security camera?

367
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:55,490
I've checked all the CCTV's near the entrance to Baekto Valley.

368
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,950
But she's not on any of them.

369
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,154
I think she's still on the mountain.

370
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,562
I heard that you were discharged,

371
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:10,706
but I didn't expect to see you here.

372
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:16,287
Was it… because of what happened?

373
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:26,926
It was here, right? Where Sergeant Kim was found.

374
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:29,099
How's the march going?

375
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,994
No incidents?

376
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,464
Training is training, right?

377
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:38,159
It'll be over tomorrow.

378
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,856
Are you on patrol this late at night?

379
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,127
We're just checking something.

380
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,273
By chance, did you see an old lady during the march?

381
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,341
No, I haven't seen any civilian.

382
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,218
What's wrong?

383
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,095
An old lady went missing.

384
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,722
Any small thing you noticed?

385
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,493
She seems to have crossed your way.

386
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,495
Sir.

387
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:08,230
What is it?

388
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,866
When I fell behind earlier…

389
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:15,546
Oh, this is Private Ahn.

390
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,883
He lost his water bottle at the Baekto Valley ridge 3 hours ago,

391
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,787
went AWOL, and fell behind.
(T/N: AWOL - absent without leave, disappeared without telling anyone)

392
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,654
So? What happened then?

393
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,495
Did you say you saw a civilian?

394
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:50,730
Yes, sir. He said he came for hiking.

395
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,166
He was looking at a rucksack,

396
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,585
and said he was wondering whose it was.

397
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,129
What color was the rucksack?

398
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:59,081
It was pink.

399
00:36:00,149 --> 00:36:02,927
Was this it?

400
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,987
Yes. That's the one.

401
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,256
Where was this?

402
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:15,330
It was the 50-minute point from Baeksil.

403
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,858
Yes, right here.

404
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:22,029
If we take the shortcut, we could get there in an hour. Let's go.

405
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,022
Get back safely.

406
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:37,829
Over there!

407
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,906
That's her rucksack, for sure.

408
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,765
They are Rustgill mushrooms.

409
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,676
They are extremely poisonous, so why…?

410
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:51,827
What happens if you eat them?

411
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:55,373
You get dizzy, nauseous, stomachache, and hallucinations.

412
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,441
And if you eat a lot, you might die.

413
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,095
We must find her now.

414
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:18,746
[Moon Ok's Granddaughter Yi Kang]

415
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,979
No answer?

416
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,957
Wait.

417
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,922
[Moon Ok's Granddaughter Yi Kang]

418
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,387
No pulse. No vitale signs.

419
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:45,812
Senior.

420
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:49,557
Please radio them.

421
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,654
Senior.

422
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,966
Senior?

423
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:14,290
Senior!

424
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,280
Please sit down.

425
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,174
No… I'm all right.

426
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,176
Please sit.

427
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:27,312
Can you do that?

428
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:41,601
Breathe deep. Slowly.

429
00:43:46,682 --> 00:43:48,533
One more time.

430
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:21,157
This is Kang Hyun Jo speaking.

431
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:22,718
What happened?

432
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:24,202
Did you find Granny Geum Rye?

433
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,638
She still hasn't called home.

434
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,184
We found the missing person.

435
00:44:31,184 --> 00:44:32,210
You did?

436
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,188
How is she?

437
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:39,183
There are no vital signs.

438
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:41,920
She's presumed dead.

439
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,269
Her location?

440
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:58,953
Thirty meters northwest of Hyeongje Rock in Baekto Valley.

441
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:05,743
It's 30 meters northwest of Hyeongje Rock in Baekto Valley.

442
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:08,605
I'll let Bidam Shelter know.

443
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,082
It'll be a couple hours.

444
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,555
This is the second time.

445
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,544
That I'm seeing a dead person on Jirisan.

446
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,131
Back there...

447
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,986
At the stone pagoda ground… I had to let a sergeant under me die before.

448
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,915
I valued him more than anyone else.

449
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:52,146
But he died alone and lonely on the mountain because of me.

450
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,546
If we keep this pace, we'll set a new record.

451
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,066
Carry on, soldiers! Speed up a little.

452
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:04,027
Yes, Sir!

453
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,545
That's the spirit.

454
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:12,869
Kim Hyeon Su, are you all right?

455
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:15,262
Yes, Sir!

456
00:46:15,262 --> 00:46:16,790
Your hometown is near here, right?

457
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,483
That's right, Sir!

458
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,710
What a nice place to live.

459
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,438
Let your hometown energize you and get strong!

460
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:24,864
Thank you, Sir!

461
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,833
Let's go!

462
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,584
What do you mean?

463
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,919
Sergeant Kim is missing?

464
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,420
He disappeared in an instant.

465
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,796
How long has it been?

466
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,641
About thirty minutes.

467
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:45,576
Sergeant Kim!

468
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,989
Sergeant Kim!

469
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:52,383
- Sergeant Kim.
- Sergeant Kim.

470
00:46:52,383 --> 00:46:55,769
- Sergeant Kim!
- Sergeant Kim!

471
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:57,955
Kim Hyeon Su!

472
00:46:57,955 --> 00:47:00,249
Kim Hyeon Su!

473
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,962
Kim Hyeon Su!

474
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,964
Hyeon Su!

475
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,188
Hyeon Su...

476
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,130
is here...

477
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,380
And that's when I started…

478
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,784
to see people dying on this mountain.

479
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:06,400
At first, I thought I was imagining things...

480
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:12,930
Last night, a 70-year-old woman fell off a cliff while coming down from Jirisan...

481
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:17,393
Allegedly, the accident happened as a rotten rope on a cliff breaks...

482
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,413
National Park Service has been accused of an inadequate facility.
[Man Fell From Cliff... While on Restricted Trail]

483
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:23,941
But they were always followed by

484
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:30,349
the news that something bad happened on Jirisan.

485
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,516
I was afraid of coming back here.

486
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,121
But I thought it was the right thing to do.

487
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,700
Senior Kim Sol told me…

488
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,280
That there's something about this Baekto Valley.

489
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:58,267
I'm not sure if it's a ghost or a mountain spirit.

490
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,937
But I think it gave me a gift.

491
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:05,416
To save people.

492
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,573
I believed in them.

493
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:14,292
What?

[Lieutenant Choi]

496
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:30,901

He said he needed to throw up,
