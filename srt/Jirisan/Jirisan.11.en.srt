I'll be right back.

167
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:18,610
He went out to report,

168
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,571
and never came back.

169
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,744
Right, I heard that he called the station that morning.

170
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,936
Haedong Ranger Station.

171
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,298
Black Bridge...

172
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:57,858
Senior is hurt.

173
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,219
Hello? Hyun Jo?

174
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,622
I can't hear you. Where are you?

175
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,657
Black Bridge Valley!

176
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,502
Quick!

177
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,466
Seo Yi Kang!

178
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,095
- Hyun Jo.
- Kang Hyun Jo!

179
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:18,929
- Seo Yi Kang.
- Kang Hyun Jo!

180
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,048
Senior Yi Kang!

181
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,678
- Is that Hyun Jo?
- Hyun Jo!

182
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,097
Hyun Jo!

183
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,050
Hyun Jo.

184
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,628
I can't find his pulse!

185
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,399
No pulse, Sir.

186
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,690
That wasn't just an accident.

187
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,882
We weren't the only ones up on the mountain that day.

188
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,027
Seo Yi Kang!

189
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,970
Do you mean someone tried to kill you two?

190
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,057
Who would that be? Did the police tell you?

191
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,710
You're saying...

192
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,404
there was someone else at the site besides you and Hyun Jo?

193
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,297
Yes.

194
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:03,408
Someone left a pole on a snow cornice.

195
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,243
That person intentionally led us to get into an accident.

196
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:10,662
I'm not asking about that. Has the person directly threatened you in any way?

197
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:14,166
No... But he had blood on his clothes.

198
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,063
I'm sure Hyun Jo got hurt because of him, too.

199
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:20,083
Did you witness how Mr. Kang Hyun Jo got hurt?

200
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,128
No one believed me.

201
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,965
But someone was surely there.

202
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,720
Though I couldn't see the face...

203
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,748
We must find the person.

204
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:38,309
That way, we can clear the commander's false charges.

205
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,102
How can we? We don't know who it was.

206
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,255
There is a way.

207
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:43,940
What's that?

208
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:48,653
Black Bridge Valley.

209
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:57,229
Hyun Jo went there just before the accident.

210
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:01,320
If we go there, we will find evidence there.

211
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,169
What evidence?

212
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,298
Not sure yet.

213
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,288
But we'll find out when we get there.

214
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:17,590
Please take me there.

215
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,614
I can't do this alone.

216
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:27,634
Please. Help me.

217
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,901
One, two, three!

218
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:47,294
I said we can go by ourselves.

219
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,339
How will you get there without assistance?

220
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,460
[4 hours ago]

221
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,354
Jeong Goo Yeong?

222
00:26:21,354 --> 00:26:24,316
No way. Why would he...?

223
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,375
It has to be one of the park rangers.

224
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,796
The murderer was wearing our uniform.

225
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:39,206
Goo Yeong was on the mountain when Da Won got lost.

226
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:42,267
He could've easily got the commander's gloves into her hand.

227
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,257
So? What are we going to do?

228
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,484
Take Goo Yeong in?

229
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,945
No. The police won't believe us.

230
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,990
We must take him ourselves.

231
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,253
Once he finds out I have crucial evidence,

232
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,064
he'll try to kill me.

233
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,957
- Let's get the proof then.
- No.

234
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,792
No way.

235
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,379
You could get into danger.

236
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,422
Be careful.

237
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,824
There.

238
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,805
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

239
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:29,272
By the way...

240
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,950
Why did you go to the mountain that day?

241
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,420
The day Da Won went missing.

242
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:43,645
Why did you go there?

243
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,363
Da Won?

244
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,200
Is that you?

245
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,929
I had things to do.

246
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,108
Let's get going.

247
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:40,343
One thing I couldn't tell you guys about...

248
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,104
Hyun Jo.

249
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:46,691
If I end up dying...

250
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,719
maybe I can meet Hyun Jo.

251
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,757
If I see him,

252
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:58,978
maybe I could tell him what I couldn't hear, what I couldn't say.

253
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,380
Let's take a break here.

254
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:36,232
Here.

255
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,569
Oh, thanks.

256
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:57,587
How long have you and Hyun Jo known about this?

257
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:02,050
Have you two been investigating on your own the whole time?

258
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,916
That's why you two were always together.

259
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,572
Did Hyun Jo tell you anything

260
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:18,316
before the accident on the snowy mountain?

261
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,810
No.

262
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:27,183
After that incident last summer,

263
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:29,118
I haven't been able to see him.

264
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,122
Last summer...

265
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:37,780
A lot of painful things happened.

266
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:52,060
[2019]

267
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,509
Gosh.

268
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:06,264
Why do we lose every single game?

269
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:10,268
You shouldn't throw "yut" sticks so hard.

270
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,145
You drop them outside the mat every time.

271
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:15,664
Hey! We could've easily won if you avoided "geol" there.

272
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,374
Exactly, right, Senior.

273
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,003
You should use your brain more often.

274
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:34,000
You said you saw black hiking gloves.

275
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,627
Yes.

276
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:40,507
As you're aware, plenty of black hiking gloves are strewn all over Jirisan

277
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:41,991
And I don't mean just rangers.

278
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:46,154
If you include the hikers and the residents, you can't even count them.

279
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,400
We can't tell the murderer just by the gloves.

280
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,479
It has to do with the mountain.

281
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,733
All the victims had something to do with the mountain.

282
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,544
Poachers, herb collectors,

283
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,570
Hyeon Su, who died during the march,

284
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:08,426
also said that this is his hometown.

285
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,890
But...

286
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,486
there are a decent number of people who have lived near Jirisan for generations.

287
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,763
It could just be a coincidence, too.

288
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,926
But why exactly?

289
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:28,640
Why is the murderer

290
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,325
killing people on this mountain?

291
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:35,912
One thing I'm sure of.

292
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,957
It's a totally crazy person.

293
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,011
You know what though?

294
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:54,981
What?

295
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:58,893
Today's our one-year anniversary.

296
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,740
What?

297
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,927
Are we dating? Why would you keep track of that?

298
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:10,346
I didn't say that.

299
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:14,158
I just meant it's been a year since the day we saved Seung Hoon.

300
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,981
So what?

301
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:22,583
Should I light a candle on a cake for you?

302
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,087
Seriously.

303
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:30,141
Jeez.

304
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,102
Hey, go run the errands by yourself.

305
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:34,344
Huh? But we lost together.

306
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,097
I'm busy!

307
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,653
Look who it is!

308
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,015
"Yut" game loser Hyun Jo!

309
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:57,293
- Hurry over here.
- Hurry up!

310
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,340
Ugh, this is warm.

311
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,719
It took four hours to get here.

312
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,355
Two hundred and forty minutes.

313
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:21,484
Back in my days, we carried an icebox with drinks on our heads.

314
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:24,312
- Filled to the brim with ice.
- I'm leaving.

315
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,191
Hey!

316
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,135
That's my drumstick!

317
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,138
Hey!

318
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,615
That's not yours.

319
00:34:36,432 --> 00:34:37,767
This one's spicy.

320
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,519
How dare you take the crispy one.

321
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,553
Really?

322
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,622
Ready to go?

323
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,940
The "yut" game loser Seo Yi Kang.

324
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,142
We will get off first.

325
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,438
See you tomorrow.

326
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:19,825
Hello? Hello?

327
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,352
What happened?

328
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,313
I saw a man collapse on my way down the mountain.

329
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:27,415
I shook him, but he didn't wake up and didn't seem to be breathing either.

330
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,677
I was too scared and my battery ran out.

331
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:32,030
- So I just ran...
- Where did you see him?

332
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,922
Well, umm...

333
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,384

345

Well... His military dog tags were never found.

346
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,860
That kept bothering me,

347
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,616
so I came here to look for them.

348
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,447
This mountain frightened me

349

since Hyeon Su died.

350
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:31,438
But... I wanted to find my junior's article

351
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,362
and return it to his family.

352
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,399
I walked with my head down,

353
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,736
because I didn't want to see anything else.

354
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:48,100
I only thought about finding the dog tags and coming back.

355
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,286
That was the only thing on my mind.

356

But on that day...

357
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:08,179
the mountain looked so beautiful.

358
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:12,410
The mountain I saw that day wasn't an object of fear.

359

360

It's not going to be good news anyway.

- Sit, sit.

I'll go ahead since everyone's here.

378
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:53,244
The most representative summer disaster is a torrential downpour.

379
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,355
There's a saying, "Clouds hang on the mountain ridge."

380
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:59,708
When rainclouds can't pass over huge mountains over a thousand meters tall,

381
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,294
local torrential rainfall can occur,

382
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:07,091
which is unpredictable by the weather forecast and is therefore very dangerous.

383
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,243
Such local torrential rainfall is also dangerous

384
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:13,180
because it could pour on the top of the mountain but clear below,

385
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,809
so it's hard to estimate the danger.

386
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,502
The rougher the geographical features,

387
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:22,089
the more water it'll collect, increasing the flow ever so fast.

388
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:25,818
At its most rapid, it'll engulf downstream with more than three meters per second,

389
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:29,805
which is strong enough to uproot trees and wipe buildings away.

390
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:32,208
Like the expression, "Water comes standing,"

391
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:36,395
it might be too late for you to run by the time you detect danger.

392
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:41,984
A good example would be the Dowon Valley flood in 1995.

393
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:45,738
Over 200 mm of torrential downpour occurred then,

394
00:42:45,738 --> 00:42:47,406
sweeping everything in the valley

395
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:51,160
in less than an hour.

396
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,163
We were helpless in the past,

397
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:56,515
but not as much now.

398
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,334
Thanks to the response systems

399
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:01,437
such as AWS and the automatic rain gauge,

400
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:04,865
casualties are less than before.

401
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,427
But we still need to be vigilant.

402
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:11,504
Take special caution on preventing flood-related accidents

403
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,283
by fortifying patrols during the disaster prevention period

404
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,118
for illegal camping and cooking

405
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:18,136
in the national park and on campsites

406
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:22,307
near valleys vulnerable to flooding.

407
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,934

How did they pass away?

414

The shelter they were in

415
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:02,548
got swept away by a valley flood.

416
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,278
I understand why Yi Kang doesn't want to come to the ritual.

417

Pardon?

418
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:13,433
