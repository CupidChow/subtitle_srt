171
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,541
- What happened?
- We lost him.

172
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,876
What do you mean, you lost him?

173
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,879
This jerk knew the chip was in his bag.

174
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,408
He led us here on purpose.

175
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:33,884
He couldn't have gone far.

176
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,594
We can't lose him. You must find him!

177
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,426
What's going on?

178
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:57,182
I don't see him. He's gone.

179
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,870
It's Sol. He's the murderer.

180
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,306
Goo Yeong and Il Hae followed him, but they lost him on the mountain.

181
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:08,776
We must find Sol quickly before he gets rid of the evidence.

182
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,399
Captain, we must find Sol.

183
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:40,308
Goo Yeong, Il Hae. Switch the frequency to the shared channel.

184
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:45,664
Where was his last location?

185
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,049
Byeori Forest in Deokseoryeong.

186
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:51,837
Haedong Ranger Station, to all rangers.

187
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,147
An SOS reported in Deokseoryeong.

188
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:56,708
It's a national park ranger,

189
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,219
Kim Sol.

190
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:14,067
He was last seen in Byeori Forest of Deokseoryeong.

191
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,861
He can't be far.

192
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:20,307
Search 3 kilometers within Byeori Forest.

193
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,201
It must be a bedrock area.

194
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,403
Like Black Bridge Valley Shelter, with a cave.

195
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,647
It's most likely the bedrock northwest or south of Byeori Forest.

196
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,866
We're the closest. We'd get there first.

197
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,046
Let's think of this as finding a stranded hiker.

198
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,353
He's here somewhere.

199
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,142
This way!

200
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:59,012
There's a trace of someone going northwest.

201
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,514
We'll search that area.

202
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,672
So you found it easily.

203
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,142
After all that's happened,

204
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:47,986
you still stayed on the mountain to capture me?

205
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:52,766
See?

206
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:54,251
I told you ghosts exist.

207
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:57,028
People don't believe me, though.

208
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,440
You're the murderer.

209
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,376
That's right.

210
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,510
I killed all those people.

211
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:16,147
All those victims... Why?

212
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,802
Because they didn't remember.

213
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,310
They didn't remember

214
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,027
what happened back then.

215
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:34,124
I didn't mean to kill anyone at first.
[2017]

216
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:36,368
In fact, I was going to kill myself.
[2017]

217
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,052
The sound of ghosts...

218
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:06,523
They never left me alone.

219
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,154
I've tried many times to kill myself,

220
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,701
but I was saved by others every time.

221
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:25,884
So if I was on the mountain...

222
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,670
I thought they wouldn't be able to find me.

223
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:36,845
So I mixed poison in the yogurt and went there.

224
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,993
Oh, hello.

225
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:12,764
Please help me. I think I'm lost.

226
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,450
I didn't recognize him at first.

227
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,896
I thought maybe I could have some mercy on him before I died.

228
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:24,301
You're from... Jirisan's Black Bridge Valley Village?

229
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,880
That's right.

230
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,188
Why?

231
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,083

232
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,370
Are you Hyeon Su?

233
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,372
Do you know me?

234
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,917
It's me. Kim Sol.

235
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:42,911

236
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,548
- Beekeeper's Sol?
- Yeah.

- Good.

Oh, can you give me your number?

243

I'll call you when I finish my time in the military.

244
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:14,101

245
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,352
I would love to see him again.

246
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:19,364

247

248
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:32,343

249
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,722
What's wrong?

250
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,727
Here.

251

Thanks.

253
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:23,920
No one thought it was murder,

254
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,565
but an accident.

255
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:31,511
The mountain was on my side.

256
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:39,319
And I came back to the mountain as a ranger.

257
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:10,725
It wasn't hard convincing Se Wook.

258
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:15,727
He was living a hellish life like me.

259
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,734
Since then, we killed them...

260
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,029
one by one.

261
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,459
All of a sudden,

262
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,203
I stopped hearing bees.

263
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,106
Same with Eung Soon.

264
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:36,750
He wasn't aware of what his father had done.

265
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,346
But he came to investigate the flooding accident.

266
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:43,725
When I threatened him that I'd reveal the truth about the death of Se Wook's father,

267
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,519
he couldn't do anything.

268
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,881

00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:39,864
I was able to meet you.

282
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:44,327
The mountain was telling me that you were the criminal.

283
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:46,904
I should have known then.

284
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:51,034
I have no idea what you're saying.

285
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:57,707
But the truth is that you couldn't catch me.

286
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,168
That means the mountain's on my side.

287

No.
