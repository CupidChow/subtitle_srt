The murderer was trying to kill someone today, too.

175
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,314
I think...

176
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,819
you were the target.

177
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,501
But...

how do you know about that?

179
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:30,294
Did the mountain tell you that, too?

180
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,484
I found out while doing some investigating

181
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:40,179
after what happened to Lee Se Wook.

182

All the victims were...

183
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,903
from the Black Bridge Valley.

184

First, it was my mom,

192
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,340
then Se Wook's dad...

193
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,785
and then my father's was the last one.

194

197
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,660
committed suicide.

198

I was too young to remember.

202

to such a young child?

203

What about the ghost lights you mentioned?

204

You told me...

205
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,847
that the village disappeared not because of the cable cars or the demolition,

206

but because of the ghost lights.

After the village got demolished, I left Jirisan.

Because both my parents passed, I went to live with relatives in Seoul.
