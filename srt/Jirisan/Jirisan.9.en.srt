- Yup.

350
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,766
- How much water did you drink?
- Not much, but...

351
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,144
- I want to pee.
- You want to pee?

352
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,608
- Oh, I'm worn out.
- We're almost there.

353

- Are you good?
- Yeah.

354
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,034
Not many people know about this place.

355
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,561
It's slippery here.

Isn't this great?

357
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,717
It opens up your chest!

358

If you come up here in the evening,

359
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,784
the sun sets right over there.

360
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:52,630
And the moon from over there, they hang side by side on the horizon.

361
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,457
It's beautiful.

365

I feel like a real ranger now.

Why do you say that?

367
00:39:17,046 --> 00:39:19,814
It's always bothered me.

368
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,410
I can't climb the mountain,

369
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,861

You can try rope climbing, too.

I've been feeling sick. Is your phone working?

Mine has no signal.

Why would mine work if yours doesn't?

I'm sorry, but can you please help me?

I'd appreciate it if you could take me

Then,

00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:40,253
could you let the rangers know that I'm here?

517

Jeez, lady.

518
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:45,341
Do you want me to take myself in for illegal hiking?

519
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:48,562
I'll get kicked out of here too, if I tell the rangers.

520

I'll make a report on my way down, once I'm done with my business.

Am I not allowed to get some rest?

Maybe you should take a break, too.

Hey! Is our job a joke to you?

Why don't you just quit?

It's a very bad omen.

On Jirisan,

there are restricted trails where people aren't allowed to enter.

575

In the deep, rough mountain pass of Deokseoryeong,

They look like they've been deserted for a long time.

This village is called Black Bridge Valley Village.

585
00:56:13,878 --> 00:56:17,072
It was maintained until 1991,

586
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:19,550
well, after Jirisan became a national park.

587
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:24,914
Apparently, there were about 15 families living there at the time.

588
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,908
But...

589
00:56:27,575 --> 00:56:31,930
why did the people in this village all disappear?

590
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,720
I'll dive right into that unanswered question.

Everyone,

00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:39,004
where could all the villagers have gone?

593
00:57:39,004 --> 00:57:41,357
There are many rumors.

594
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:46,011
That they'd been forced to move out by National Park Service to restore nature,

595
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:49,316
or that they moved all together to the foot of the mountain for a better living.

596
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:53,185
But one strange thing stood out.

597
