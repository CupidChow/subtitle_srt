I cannot imagine how tough it will be for her to arrange a funeral alone.

That bridge was in danger of collapsing, so we'd blocked off that road.

It's a mystery that the bus went that way.

The driver may not have seen the warning sign because of the heavy rain.

The murderer did.

00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,934
He must be stalking the villagers.

503
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:09,027
Someone might die there tomorrow.

504
00:59:09,027 --> 00:59:10,546
I should stop before then.

505
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,557
What brings you here?

506
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,467
Someone made a false report.

507
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,980
Are you going to kill him, too?
