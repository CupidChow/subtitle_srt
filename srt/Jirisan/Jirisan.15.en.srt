What do you know, kid?

381
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,323
My family's been collecting herbs and catching animals on that mountain

382

since my grandfather's grandfather.

They never had any reason to remain there...

What?

385
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:48,562
The wildlife protection law became stronger in the late eighties.

386
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,940
And the national park's law enforcement became strict, along with it.

387
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:56,387
Snake hunters and poachers must have received great damage.

388
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,430
Not only that.

389
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,059
The national park legislation, both criminal and civil, were reinforced around that time,

390
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,160
so people couldn't easily collect things from the mountain.

391
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,621
It must have been hard for the herb collectors for example.

392

They probably wanted to leave.

393

But not beekeeping.

395
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:21,458
Right. The government took various measures to preserve native species of bees at the time.

396
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,305
They even gave financial support

397
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,960
and planted trees like chestnut trees that produced nectar.

398
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,421
Some of them wanted to leave,

399
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,157
but others wanted to stay.

400
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:40,431

Did the person responsible get caught?

409
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,557
It happened on a path only the villagers took,

410
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,228
so they suspected the villagers, but no one was caught.

The police searched for the old bumper but couldn't find it.

There was no CCTV camera or eyewitness,
