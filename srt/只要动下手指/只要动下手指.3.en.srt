1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:05,553
Oh, this is annoying

2
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:06,700
She's impossible

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:08,075
Ugh

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,616
There she is

5
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:18,021
Darn it

6
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:24,858
Excuse me

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,115
Oh

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,140
What?

9
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,371
It was you?

10
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,006
Darn it

11
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,576
(Hello)

12
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,247
(Is the wallet still for sale?)

13
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:46,074
(Yes, it is)

14
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,347
(How much are you
willing to come down to?)

15
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:51,172
(How much are you willing to pay?)
Ugh, she's such a slow responder

16
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:53,465
Seriously?

17
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,353
(I think I see a scratch in the buckle)

18
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:02,298
(Can I get a closer look?)

19
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:16,273
(You'd need to take
50,000 won off for that)

20
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:18,005
(Can you do that???)

21
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,448
Come on

22
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:26,911
(It's the start of the semester
so I'm short on money)

23
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,683
(My friend gifted it to me)

24
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,983
(but I lost it...)

25
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,648
(and I feel so sorry to her)

26
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:33,460
(Can you please reconsider?)

27
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:36,026
(I need that same wallet)

28
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:39,339
(Sorry, I have a buyer who's
willing to buy it at the listed price)

29
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:40,904
Oh, darn it

30
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,872
(Actually, the thing about
my friend was a lie)

31
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:50,612
(I really wanted to buy that
so I saved money for a month)

32
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:52,717
(I really wanted to have it
so I worked part-time in telecom sales,)

33
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:55,616
(at the supermarket,
and I also distributed flyers)

34
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,688
(Please???)

35
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:00,921
Come on

36
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,335
Please, please

37
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,920
Please

38
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,119
(Eunvely sent you a message)

39
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:09,096
(Okay, I'll give you
a 50,000 won discount)

40
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,499
Yay

41
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,766
You should've said that earlier

42
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:18,977
Baby, I'll see you soon

43
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,674
How pretty

44
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,610
Was it you, Sae-na?

45
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,216
I would've given it for free
if I knew it was you

46
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,350
Oh

47
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,318
You can take it

48
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,385
Hey, I have money, too

49
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,294
This doesn't even cost that much

50
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,131
You don't have to
I haven't used it for over two years

51
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,342
I didn't even think
someone would buy this

52
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,802
It's from an old season

53
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,409
I was going to donate it to a flea market

54
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,906
I'm perfectly fine

55
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,982
It's not as pretty in real life

56
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:04,644
I'm not buying it

57
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:06,235
Bye

58
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:10,157
Oh, this is so embarrassing

59
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:19,771
(Episode 3)

60
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,439
Is he the guy you mentioned last time?

61
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Yes

62
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,076
He looks better in real life, doesn't he?

63
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:32,906
Can he sing?

64
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,693
Or dance?

65
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:37,879
Well...

66
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:39,993
if he can't do both,

67
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,489
just send him to the other place

68
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,607
Throw that away on your way out

69
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,348
Soo-bin

70
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,892
Tomorrow's your pay day

71
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,329
but you still haven't sent me
a copy of your bank account and ID card

72
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,810
Can you...

73
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:29,563
please pay me in cash?

74
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,657
That would complicate the paperwork

75
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:36,651
I have my reasons

76
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:39,513
You can pay me less

77
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:44,017
Please do me a favor

78
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,289
You're not

79
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,700
a student at Hankuk Arts University,
are you?

80
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:48,892
Why are you here?

81
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,630
You don't have to come here anymore

82
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,885
Where are you going?

83
00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,359
You don't have to know

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,103
Joo Sun-jae, pick up your phone

85
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:21,784
You're the only one
wearing noise-canceling headphones

86
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:24,958
You should put your phone
on silent mode or turn it off

87
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:30,422
I'm leaving

88
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,242
Hi

89
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,509
You're Moon Ye-ji

90
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:40,262
Since the door is open,

91
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:41,626
I'll let myself in

92
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,796
(This is crazy)

93
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:50,510
(Ye-ji is in Sun-jae's studio!)

94
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:06,809
Time for school

95
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:23,855
Hey!

96
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:26,175
You trash

97
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:27,835
What?

98
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,316
Trash

99
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,203
You're cute

100
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,126
Hey!

101
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:41,969
Did you smoke in the hallway again?

102
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,734
I can't believe this

103
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,868
Come out for a second

104
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,506
You should go to school

105
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:10,013
Have you ever gone to school
with a cat?

106
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:17,178
I'm Ok-sun, and I'm lonely!

107
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,176
Let's go to school!

108
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,216
Ugh, what's wrong with her?

109
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,924
- Hi
- Hi

110
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,077
You're here again

111
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:45,425
Did you go to Sun-jae's again today?

112
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:46,993
Yeah

113
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:48,995
I go there every day

114
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,653
I might win the perfect attendance award

115
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,020
You're putting in so much effort

116
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,045
Joo Sun-jae

117
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,070
Joo Sun-jae

118
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,956
Oh!

119
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,304
"Please find Joo Sun-jae"?

120
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:02,842
Joo Sun-jae

121
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,856
Sae-na, let me see

122
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:12,519
Your lips look beautiful

123
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,650
That color is so you
Where did you get it?

124
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:15,797
- Isn't it pretty?
- It is

125
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,288
It's so pretty

126
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,761
It's no.3 Dragon Planet

127
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,894
Let's buy that on our way home

128
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,065
We have to

129
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,090
Ju-hyuk

130
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:25,532
Yes?

131
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:26,833
How do I look today?

132
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,482
Incredible

133
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:35,441
I'm so pretty

134
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,581
Sae-na

135
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,794
Is your ideal type
still a good-looking guy?

136
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,053
Of course!

137
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,989
(But you're looking right at him)

138
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,594
(Does Sae-na have poor vision?)

139
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:53,426
How many fingers am I showing?

140
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:57,134
Joo Sun-jae seemed 
pretty handsome last time

141
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,431
Does he have a girlfriend?

142
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,093
I don't know

143
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,611
- Why isn't Sun-jae coming to school?
- Joo Sun-jae

144
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,636
Joo Sun-jae

145
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:09,776
Joo Sun-jae

146
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,308
Joo Sun-jae

147
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,654
Joo Sun-jae

148
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,248
No, I like Tae-jun

149
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,314
When is Tae-jun coming?

150
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,134
Choi Tae-jun

151
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,474
Choi Tae-jun, Joo Sun-jae

152
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:39,985
Hi

153
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,593
Were you waiting for me?

154
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,073
Of course, not

155
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,171
I know

156
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,509
Trash

157
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,733
I told you I'm not trash

158
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,666
Do you have no social skills?

159
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,359
Hey

160
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:59,848
You shouldn't say
things like that to anyone

161
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:02,488
especially me

162
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,260
You're already in trouble

163
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,721
Sungwon Villa Room 203

164
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,335
What do you think will happen
if I upload this?

165
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,688
Everyone is wondering who you are

166
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:26,861
What's wrong?

167
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:27,988
(I told you I had no choice)

168
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,019
What are you doing?

169
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,683
(I told you I was sorry)

170
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,492
Let's skip school today

171
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,799
There's this place I go to
every Wednesday

172
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,436
Let's skip school and go there today

173
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,043
Open the door

174
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,551
Just once, come on

175
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:25,171
Let's get some air

176
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,574
Your mind is full of this right now

177
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,924
He looks thrown off

178
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,949
Hello

179
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:46,974
Hi

180
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,547
This does look a bit stuffy, I know

181
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,203
Where's the guy you used to
come here every week with?

182
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,206
Who's the new face?

183
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,442
Did you get a new boyfriend?

184
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:05,445
I told you he's not my boyfriend

185
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:07,361
And

186
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,948
he's not my boyfriend, either

187
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,441
We should clean that up first, right?

188
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:14,868
Yes

189
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,228
Please do a good job like you always do

190
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:19,253
Sure

191
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:20,841
Thanks

192
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,633
Think of this place as your mind
and empty it

193
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:28,995
Let's go!

194
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,930
What?

195
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,675
You'll have to work all day at this pace

196
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,840
Do they have bowel problems?

197
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,768
Their poo is so stiff

198
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,838
What was it I had to feed them?

199
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,112
#I found Joo Sun-jae

200
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,772
Sun-jae changed his number
Stop calling

201
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,381
How about doing this in this part?

202
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,583
Play that again

203
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:04,998
Da-eun

204
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,128
We won't be able to win like this

205
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,447
What do you mean?

206
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:13,500
You can't focus at all

207
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,244
Are you in a bad mood today?

208
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:30,283
Everything

209
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,044
got complicated

210
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,386
I don't drink plain milk

211
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,888
Oh

212
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,145
But it's good

213
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:17,803
Go away

214
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:19,365
You can't eat this, anyway

215
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,136
Hey, don't stroke him

216
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,428
Why?

217
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:29,357
You're getting his hopes up

218
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:35,348
You can't even take responsibility

219
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:36,830
but you're pretending to be kind

220
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,151
and making him expect you
to always be there

221
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:44,223
You're giving him false hope

222
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:46,559
I don't like that

223
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,599
He might not want you

224
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:57,336
to take responsibility

225
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,709
He might just want
a warm touch at this moment

226
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,811
Looking away right now

227
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,835
may hurt him even more

228
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,120
Right?

229
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,709
If you can be so considerate to dogs,

230
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:49,689
can you be more considerate to me, too?

231
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,036
Please

232
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:35,607
How did you do that?

233
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,202
By being flexible

234
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,582
Why are you in Ye-ji's seat?

235
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:52,685
Because she's not here yet

236
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,756
Sae-na, I knew it

237
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,792
You're practicing really hard

238
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:02,030
I should practice harder, too

239
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,295
Why would you say that?

240
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,934
Because your shoes are worn out

241
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:16,127
They're vintage

242
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:18,377
You!

243
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,859
Soo-bin, you're here

244
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,863
I haven't seen you two
together in a while

245
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:34,863
I know, right?

246
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:36,556
You were always talking about Joo

247
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:37,710
- Sun
- Jae

248
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:38,974
these days

249
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,034
No, I wasn't

250
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,177
We met in the hallway

251
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,183
Oh, right
Joo Sun-jae

252
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:59,043
Is he performing with you?

253
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,488
Probably

254
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:03,761
Probably?

255
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:07,293
Why do you sound uncertain?

256
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,629
Isn't today the last day of applications?

257
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,015
Today

258
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,098
Today

259
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:17,603
You have to submit
the application in person

260
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,719
He'll be here

261
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,322
Sun-jae will be here
Let's wait

262
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,340
Hi, guys

263
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,818
Hello

264
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,603
Good morning

265
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:05,885
Who's submitting their applications?

266
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,203
- Me
- Okay

267
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,062
- Are you performing, too?
- Yes

268
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,042
Sir!

269
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,175
Good morning

270
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:28,428
Yes, it's a wonderful morning

271
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:32,173
But you troublemakers 
should go back to your class now

272
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:34,647
We're not troublemakers

273
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,173
We're artists

274
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,351
Fine, off you go now

275
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:41,627
- Hurry up
- They're hilarious

276
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:45,457
You know today's the last day
to apply for the arts festival, right?

277
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:46,793
Yes

278
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:48,478
Have you all submitted
your applications?

279
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:49,724
Anybody left?

280
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:51,258
No, right?

281
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:52,551
- No
- No

282
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,499
Oh

283
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:56,249
Moon Ye-ji

284
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,774
Have you finally gotten back
to your senses?

285
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:05,947
But who are you performing with?

286
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,081
Probably Soo-bin

287
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:15,688
Yes, Cha Soo-bin

288
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:19,325
But Soo-bin is performing with Da-eun

289
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,659
Really?

290
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:02,757
- Oh
- Whoa

291
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:03,857
- Joo Sun-jae is here
- Isn't that Joo Sun-jae?

292
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:05,462
That's Joo Sun-jae

293
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:08,095
He's actually here

294
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,135
He's even performing
at the arts festival

295
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,160
No way

296
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:31,554
Oh, okay

297
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,281
Hey, I got something

298
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:39,738
You, too?

299
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:42,032
I got a picture

300
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,176
What's this?

301
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:15,599
(Snap and Spark)
