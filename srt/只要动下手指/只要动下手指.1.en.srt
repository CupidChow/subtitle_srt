This is the freshmen welcome party

2
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:17,591
Hey, can you zoom in?

3
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:19,442
How about another picture?

4
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:20,944
Just strip off everything

5
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:23,039
You're crazy

6
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:25,309
Crazy genius

7
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:28,912
This is awesome

8
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:48,819
I...

9
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:51,204

Yum

13
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,084
Somebody should stop him

14
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:13,600
Hey, pig

15
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,857
It's time to eat
Not human food

16
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,415
Pig food

17
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:21,885
Go on

18
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:23,226
Eat it

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,172
A pig can't use hands

20
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:38,862
Use your mouth

21
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:51,948
Look here

22
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:54,317
One, two, three

23
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:01,017
Moon Ye-ji?

24
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:03,693
Did you just take a picture?

25
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:09,339
My debut is fixed now so my producer said
to be careful about pictures

26
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:11,728
Don't worry

27
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:14,144
I'm not uploading you on my feed

28
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:16,899
Sorry, my producer makes a big deal

29
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:17,894
You're too...

30
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:19,623
below my league

31
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:22,739
What?

32
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:25,515
Also

33
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,885
who you should be scared of now

34
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:31,536
is not your producer

35
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,530
but him

36
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:39,215
(New friend) (_dddongyu)
(New Friend, what should we eat tomorrow?)

37
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,143
I picked him

38
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,737
Whoa, how do you know Moon Ye-ji?

39
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,773
How are you close with Ye-ji?

40
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,478
How close are you two?

41
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:06,346
Whoa, no way

42
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,833
(What brand is that t-shirt?) (Link, please)
(Ye-ji's beautiful as always)

43
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,077
(A New Friend is up) (Isn't that Lee Dong-gyu?)
(Congrats on becoming popular)

44
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,185
(Please read my DM) (Will I get to see
Ye-ji if I attend Hankuk Arts High School?)

45
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:28,665

(Thanks for posting me on your feed!
I'll always follow you, this is a present)

49
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,299
(And I even gain money)

(in secret)

55
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:44,922
Amazing

56
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,350
He's so amazing

57
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:51,390
Cha Soo-bin

58
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,601
He's cute

59
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:05,348
(But he never said he liked anyone)

60
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:07,824
Hey, everyone's crazy
about your boyfriend dyeing his hair black

61
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:09,986
Boyfriend?

62
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,861
(No way)

63
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:15,091
Ye-ji, Soo-bin looks amazing
with black hair

64
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,449
Ye-ji, just leave Soo-bin
for all of us to secretly admire

65
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,838
Don't be ridiculous

66
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:25,502
The only guy suitable for Ye-ji
in school is Cha Soo-bin

67
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:27,284
We're not dating

68
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,305

Look at this

69
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,849
Everyone's talking about you

70
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,730
'Where's Moon Ye-ji?'
'He's a sculpture'

71
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,244
Don't be ridiculous

72
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:38,788

Da-eun is amazing

81
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,258
I want to win that award, too

82
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,450
You're too loud

(Kim Da-eun)

84
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:27,319
Da-eun got expensive private lessons

85
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,612
and she won an award
from the start of the semester

86
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:34,130
Money does solve problems

87
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:46,142

88
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:50,046

and when you look at each other)

90

91
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:01,554
Did you see me?

92
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:02,424
I did

93
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,447
You lit up the stage back there

94
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,550
You're good-looking and smart

95
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,512
Good for you

96
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,581
It was hard this time

97
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:17,053
The goddess of the Dance Department
wants your number

98
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,215
Do you know what
"Confession Day" is?

99
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:24,001
(Confession Day=
100 days before Christmas)

100
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,182
Everyone in my class is wild about that

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,757
You have to help me out

102
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,433
I don't have time to date anyone

103
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,059
You're right

104
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,114
You don't have time to date

105
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,346
You changed your earrings

106
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:46,212
You look pretty

107
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:55,733
You're a jerk

108
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:57,021
This is why...

109
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,351
You two are dating, aren't you?

110
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:06,129
Tell me
I won't tell anyone else

111
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:08,818
I said we're not

112
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:15,601
You two are suspicious

113
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:19,395
The whole world is hooking us up

114
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,739
(But I decided to ignore it completely)

115
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,395
(I was tricked by that smile of his
for ten years)

116
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:29,850
(My favorite snack) (Snowboarding class)
(Moon Ye-ji/8) (Cha Soo-bin/8)

117
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,808
(Cha Soo-bin and I were friends
since we were 8)

118
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,322
(When Soo-bin and I went to the valley)

119
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:36,272
(He was an ordinary guy friend)

120
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:39,422
(Moon Ye-ji) (Cha Soo-bin) (Middle school)
(I never thought of him as anything else)

121
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,512
(Why are you smiling like that, Soo-bin?)
(But one day)

122
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:44,534
(On a hot day) (Enjoying the night view)
(Wearing winter uniforms) (he grew...)

123
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:46,339
(Cha Soo-bin) (Moon Ye-ji)
(When did Soo-bin grow this much?) (so much)

124
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:49,393
(Spring, first year of high school)
(It started that day)

125
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,582
(We were shooting Reels for fun)

126
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,038
(Once)

127
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:12,344
(Twice)

128
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:17,587
(Three times)

129
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,223
It tickles

130
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,511
(I couldn't be friends anymore)

131
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,044
(A guy and girl friend can't hold hands)
(This is crazy) (I'm getting butterflies)

132
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,232
(Tell us you two are dating)
(So, are you two dating?)

133
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,600
(I want to unsee that and see it again)
(Look at this, it's so cute)

134
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,003
(I came to see this again)
(Anyone know the guy's Instagram?)

135
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,168
(They look perfect together) (I think he likes her)
(If that's a guy friend, I don't have friends)

136
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:02,624
(But that girl looks cute)

137
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,433
(I'm a girl, but I'm jealous of that guy)
(Look at her, she's cute) (And...)

138
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,716
(I'm a guy, and I'm jealous of that girl)
(Is that possible with a friend?) (my life changed)

139
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,870
(That must be ticklish) (Anyone know his handle?)

What was that?

146
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,219
Don't copy that

147
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,967
It's Cha Soo-bin and Moon Ye-ji

148
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:46,856
You two are dating, aren't you?

149
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,778
- Tell us

150
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:49,545
No

151
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,305
But...

152
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,321
Cha Soo-bin

153
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:09,453
Why did you give me this?

154
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:13,162
Because I like you

155
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,075
Things are going to change from now

156
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,423
Cha Soo-bin

157
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:29,595
Let's go out

158
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,755
Ye-ji

159
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:48,421
Sorry

160
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,210
Now is not the right time

161
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,039
'Why did you give me this?'

162
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:24,503
'Because I like you'

163
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,698
Why?

164
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:33,556
What was this, then?

165
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,421
(Now) (Mint chocolate milk)

166
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:53,609
Ye-ji, how about performing
at the arts festival?

167
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,148
Hankuk Arts University and entertainment
companies are sponsoring it, so...

168
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,181
I don't do things like that

169
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:01,885
But you're a good singer

170
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:06,596
If you win, you get additional points in
entering university and even companies

171
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,117
Universities and entertainment companies

172
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:10,871
There's nothing I want to do
in any of them

173
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:13,709
Working my guts out
just because everyone else is going

174
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:15,054
I don't want that

175
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:31,193
I'm working really hard so that
I can do things with the girl I like

176
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:34,283
like strolling the campus with her
and saving money to travel together

177
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,037
Who is that?

178
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:50,109
Let's go

179
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:07,197
I think you're the one

180
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,252
who's pushing Soo-bin away

181
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:13,642
How about accepting Soo-bin now?

182
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,583
How about that?

183
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:17,910
Guys

184
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,166
If you've been friends for a decade,
you're family

185
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:25,441
- You look pretty
- You look pretty

186
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:27,848
This?

187
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,399
Do you call this a family?

188
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,479
Family...

189
00:15:30,774 --> 00:15:31,768
I can't do that

190
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:34,193
Never

191
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,401
Just imagining my brother doing that...

192
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:42,192
Isn't that ??? lip tint?

193
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:43,867
I heard this is crazy long-lasting

194
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:47,260
It doesn't come off when you eat
and I love the color

195
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:48,951
Moon Ye-ji

196
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:50,249
It's the perfect shade for you

197
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,536
This would look good on you too

198
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:56,100
But Da-eun doesn't wear makeup

199
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:57,273
Right?

200
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:00,182
Let me try it

201
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:09,565
This is beautiful

202
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:10,807
- Beautiful
- Yes

203
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:12,588
I'm going to wear this
at the arts festival

204
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,464
Da-eun

205
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,802
Didn't you say you wanted
to perform at the arts festival?

206
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,041
I did

207
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:25,061
Have you decided on
who to perform with?

208
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,093
No, not yet

209
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:31,834
Soo-bin and Da-eun
should perform together

210
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:34,805
They can play a piano duet

211
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:40,943
Ju-hyuk

212
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,365
Be quiet

213
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,643
Show us...

214
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:49,554
your talent

215
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,768
I want to listen to you play Beethoven

216
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,185
Beethoven is all you know, isn't it?

217
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,872
Yeah, do you know anyone else?

218
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:02,139
Of course, I do

219
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,103
Who?

220
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,661
I know Gogh, Van Gogh

221
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,636
Oh, do you wear this, too?

222
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:24,907
What's so funny?

223
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,831
Because it's hilarious
Why are you wearing it in secret?

224
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,301
But I wasn't

225
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:38,129
Da-eun, don't hide

226
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,057
What's wrong with copying others?
It's totally fine

227
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,761
Here, you look adorable

228
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,666
See you

229
00:17:57,437 --> 00:17:58,327
Okay

230
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,169
Bye

231
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:22,958
I didn't copy her

232
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:27,721

235
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,097
You took...

236
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,573
everything

237
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,638
(Cha Soo-bin)

238
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,091
(Can I talk to you for a minute later?)

239
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:29,027
(All of a sudden?)

240
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:30,282
(Why?)

241
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,004
(I have to tell you something)

(September 17th Sunday=Christmas D-100)
(= Confession Day is TODAY)

00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,038
(I'm working really hard so that
I can do things with the girl I like)

244
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,678
(Who is that?)

245
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,699
No way

246
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:17,282
(I wonder...)

247
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:18,557
(what he's going to say)

248
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:26,778
Sorry

249
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,325
I'm going to confess my love

250
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,363
(Today is the day)

251
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,465
to Da-eun

252
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:42,150
I'm going to confess my love

253
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:43,121
to Da-eun

254
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,893
You look pretty
Because I like you

255
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:46,041
You two are dating, aren't you?

256
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:48,944
The only guy suitable for Ye-ji
in school is Cha Soo-bin

257
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,053
I'm going to confess my love

258
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:53,557
to Da-eun

259
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,604
to Da-eun

260
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:02,052
What?

261
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:09,458
Who?

262
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,319
[Snap and Spark]

263
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:33,929
Joo Sun-jae

264
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:38,664
He's a new face

265
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:39,985
I know, right?

266
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,924
He's Joo Sun-jae

267
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:46,148
With his skills, he's got no problem
going into Hankuk Arts University

268
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:49,044
but he's not coming to school

269
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:51,193
What a shame
