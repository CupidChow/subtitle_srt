1
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:32,640
If you stop getting private lessons,

2
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,269
you fall behind right away

3
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:45,846
So think about it

4
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,481
There's an easier way

5
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,227

8
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,558
- What?
- Isn't that Joo Sun-jae?

9
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:31,274
It's been such a long time

10
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:49,059
Oh, okay

It's already our 16th day

16
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:22,719
It feels good to be here
because it's just the two of us

17
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,948
16th day?

18
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:26,856
- What does that mean?
- What's this?

19
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,726
Wasn't that Kim Da-eun's voice?

20
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,967
Then Soo-bin and Da-eun...

21
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:32,358
Are they dating?

22
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:34,731
- What?
- Really?

23
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:35,779
- Are they dating?
- Seriously?

24
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:37,426
- It seems so
- Is this real?

25
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:38,682
- They're dating?
- For real?

26
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:41,605
- What was the 16th day thing?
- They've been dating for 16 days

27
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:42,613
I sent the wrong file

28
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,168
I was going to send
an announcement about the midterm

29
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,746
Be quiet, guys

30
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:49,966
You've submitted
all your applications, right?

31
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,928
Time's up now

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,976
Soo-bin, come see me
at the teachers' room

33
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,849
- What is it with those two?
- Is this for real?

34
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,520
Your tuition fee came in too late last time
The 4th quarter deadline is soon

35
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:25,849
Is there anything I can help with?

36
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,509
I had my reasons last time
It's fine now

37
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,496
I'll keep it a secret

38
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:36,240
(6 months ago)

39
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,098
But promise me one thing

40
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:49,232
then I'll keep it a secret no matter what

41
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,563
(I hoped nothing would change)

42
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:57,247
I told you I can't pick up
when I'm at school

43
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,416
I have three semesters left
and the monthly rent to pay

44
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:02,025
Yes

45
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,474
I have to keep taking lessons

46
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:07,431
The first performance test
and arts festival is coming up soon

47
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:09,746
No

48
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,283
It's lunchtime now

49
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:14,754
I'll hang up now

50
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,607
(2023 3rd/4th Quarter Tuition Payment)
(Tuition: 1,535,830 won)

51
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,063
(Due by Friday, October 6th) (Notifications will
be sent individually if unpaid until the 3rd date)

52
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,911
Do you want me to help?

53
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:31,578
I didn't mean to eavesdrop

54
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,519
but I can help you

55
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,915
(Yes, I'm going to get a part-time job,
so don't worry)

56
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:21,444
(I read your application, Can you come
for an interview at 4:30 tomorrow?)

57
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,755
You said you're a student
at Hankuk Arts University, right?

58
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,181
Yes

59
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:33,029
You play well
and you look handsome, too

60
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,140
But are you sure you're of legal age?

61
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,120
I can't figure it out
just by the looks these days

62
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,030
(I wasn't hoping for anything special)

63
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,619
(Can we meet at 5:30 in the playground?)

64
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,876
Cha Soo-bin

65
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:25,418
Let's go out

66
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,151
Sorry

67
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:38,938
Now is not the right time

68
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,730
(And)

69
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,454
(Now)

70
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,848
(Everything has changed)

71
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:09,188
Soo-bin

72
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,775
The teacher wants to see us

73
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,094
Why?

74
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:18,469
To talk about the piece we're playing

75
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:20,236
Let's go

76
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:40,947
Let's go

77
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:42,632
You scared me

78
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,108
We have to practice

79
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,355
Sir

80
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,099
Sir

81
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,420
It's the entrance examination soon

82
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,312
Oh, guys

83
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:13,839
Why are you here?

84
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:16,246
I heard you wanted to talk
about the piece we're playing

85
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,612
Did I?

86
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,402
You told me to come see you after class

87
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,463
Oh, I did?

88
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,330
I'm forgetting things these days

89
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,297
What song are the aces playing

90
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,835
at the arts festival?

91
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,719
We're thinking about arranging
the song you recommended

92
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,182
Arranging it faster?

93
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,011
No, actually slower

94
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,437
I want to start out lyrical
and then progress to a jazzy vibe

95
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:47,030
It won't be easy to play it like that

96
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,643
But I'm not worried about the aces

97
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,928
It's Ye-ji and Sun-jae
who I'm worried about

98
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,585
That incident with Joo Sun-jae...

99
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:57,394
I'm hungry

100
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,397
Make sure you practice
until next Wednesday

101
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:01,414
You can go

102
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:09,745
I can't believe
Soo-bin and Da-eun are dating

103
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,618
Did they fall in love
while preparing for the arts festival?

104
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,188
They say a man and a woman
can never be friends

105
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:17,496
Do you think a man
and a woman cannot be friends?

106
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:20,890
Hey!

107
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,293
(Ye-ji, this is Yeon-hoo
Can we talk today?)

108
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,943
Don't go on a diet
I don't want to lose even 1 gram of you

109
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,221
(Please help me just once
I'm begging you)

110
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,871
(I might have to drop out of school)

111
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,621
(Please see me just once)

112
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:38,374
(See you next to the arts building
at 7 PM today)

113
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,801
I heard Tae-jun likes girls
who watch their figure

114
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,721
Ye-ji

115
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,046
Choi Tae-jun

116
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:52,922
What should I do now?

117
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,625
Sun-jae, let's do it

118
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,368
No

119
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,425
Let's just give it a try

120
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,597
I'm already prepared to do it

121
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,650
But we're not...

122
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,026
that close yet

123
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:26,629
Why not?
I saw the teacher watch your video

124
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,108
That was just a guide version

125
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,593
But if I write the music
and also sing,

126
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,803
what are you doing?

127
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:39,992
I'll write the lyrics

128
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:42,655
Do you have any experience?

129
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:44,905
Isn't writing the lyrics

130
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,821
all about writing the story inside you?

131
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,988
There's a lot to tell inside me

132
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:53,609
Okay

133
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:55,865
Love

134
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:57,847
It's about love

135
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,918
I'm perfect, but I cannot have you

136
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,818
You don't look at me

137
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,712
and you say you like someone else

138
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:13,936
The person you like...

139
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:19,305
is my friend

140
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:24,877
You and I must've been friends, too

141
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:28,661
Fine, I misunderstood everything

142
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,620
You were just being nice

143
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,705
But I thought you liked me, too

144
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,116
You made it confusing

145
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,392
That's why I asked you out

146
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:42,972
You're the first person
I ever asked out

147
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,267
He's not listening again

148
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:03,797
Delusion

149
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,380
True feelings

150
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:15,241
Whoa

151
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,881
That's Sun Ju-hyuk

152
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:18,437
Who's Sun Ju-hyuk?

153
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,410
Don't you know him?

154
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,626
He got into the debuting team in a regular
high school and transferred to our school

155
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,990
Oh, the guy in the Dance Department?
Is he the dancer of the team?

156
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:27,979
No

157
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:29,452
Is he the vocalist?

158
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:31,721
No way

159
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,319
The rapper?

160
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,393
Oh, he's the team visual

161
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,442
That's right

162
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:51,301
He's the face of the group

163
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:54,484
Actually

164
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:58,480
I don't think I'm handsome

165
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,105
He's way uglier than me

166
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:38,557
from every angle

167
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,281
He's so ugly

168
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,818
Good-looking men are the best

169
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,139
(She said good-looking men are the best)

170
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,013
(I came to school looking my best today)

171
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:07,069
- (You look nice)
- (I know)

172
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:10,012
(I have a nice face, nice hands...
Every inch of me is beautiful)

173
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:12,397
But why isn't it me?

174
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,141
Aren't I good-looking?

175
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,759
(Ju-hyuk, the good-looking men
that Sae-na talks about)

176
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:25,494
(are men with overwhelmingly
good-looking skills)

177
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,009
I'm going to look good-looking

178
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:36,165
with my skills, not my face

179
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:46,402
How did that awkward guy
get in the debuting team?

180
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:47,526
With his looks

181
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,919
Hey, turn off the lights
before you leave

182
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,443
I'm sorry,
but the lights will never go off

183
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,893
Even the light in my heart

184
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:13,145
Choi Tae-jun

185
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:28,594
Sun Ju-hyuk, you're really good-looking

186
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:29,903
Your face?

187
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,831
Nope, your skills

188
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:38,694
Sun Ju-hyuk, you're absolutely
good-looking right now

189
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:43,967
It's nothing

191
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:46,430
I really like you

192
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,555
(I said I had no choice)

193
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:51,844
(I said I'm sorry)

194
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:58,551
Get out

195
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,761
- (Sun-jae is doomed now)
- (He made a fool out of Heo Sol-a)

196
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:03,777
- (I knew he'd do that someday)
- (He's a piece of trash)

197
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,521
- (Poor Heo Sol-a)
- (He's such a scum)

198
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:56,105
Nice

199
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:00,116
This part sounds way better this way

200
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,016
I like you

201
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:13,939
I've liked you
since the first time I saw you

202
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:19,925
You need me

203
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:29,799
How about...

204
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:34,157
going out for real?

205
00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:39,512
I mean

206
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:43,612
let's go out

♪ I found out the truth ♪

208
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:12,961
♪ Our breaths meet, Heart You ♪

209
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:49,415
I like it

210
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:58,577
Let's do it
