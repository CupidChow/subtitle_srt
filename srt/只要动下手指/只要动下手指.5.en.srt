1
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:08,387
I like it

2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:15,669
I like

3
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:23,548
your voice

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,380
Hey

5
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,428
Say the full sentence, you idiot

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,300
So

7
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:34,307
I want you to sing

8
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,131
this song

9
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,643
(I'll be there on time)

10
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:50,496
Oh, right

11
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:55,849
I'll be right back

12
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:15,497
(You seem to be doing well)

13
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,065
(Here's what happened to Heo Sol-a,
who blew up for her cover of "Get Ya")
(Heo Sol-a was falsely accused)

14
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,752
(1. Pictures of Sol-a drinking, smoking,
and bullying others circulated online)

15
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:29,957
(2. It was her boyfriend JSJ's doing
but Sol-a took the blame)

16
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:33,544
(3. She kept quiet because he was her
boyfriend, but her friends uploaded proof)

17
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:34,642
(Proof for the post on NAVE
2022.08.06)

18
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:35,765
(4. Conclusion: Heo Sol-a foolishly tried
to cover for her boyfriend and got screwed)

19
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:38,986
(103 comments)
(Best comment: Screwed because of her bf)

20
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,036
(I went to the same school as JSJ
and he was always a bully)

21
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:40,991
(LOL Sol-a is such a fool, poor her)

22
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,102
(But JSJ's songs are great)

23
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,536
That incident with Joo Sun-jae...

24
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,347
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,959
Oh, right

26
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,258
Kim Yeon-hoo asked Ye-ji
to see him this evening

27
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,503
He's crazy, don't you think?

28
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:33,285
Why isn't she replying?

29
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,890
See you

30
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:36,926
Where's Ye-ji now?

31
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:51,268
Ye-ji

32
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,360
You're alone

33
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,522
I've had a hard time lately

34
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:21,503
Hey!

35
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:29,486
Please help me just once

36
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,976
Get up

37
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:33,692
I got kicked out
of the debuting team

38
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,190
These days, you can never debut
with rumors like that

39
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:37,477
You know that

40
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,597
It was my first time
bullying Dong-gyu, this is unfair

41
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:43,253
It was just a joke

42
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:44,199
I said get up

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,926
I was jealous of Dong-gyu

44
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:48,603
I was a trainee for five years
and barely got in the debuting team

45
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,835
I've never bullied anyone else
including Dong-gyu after that

46
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,110
So please upload a post on your Instagram

47
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,932
Everyone believes in everything you say

48
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:07,357
Say I've come back to my senses
and the rumors were exaggerated

49
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,714
Please say Dong-gyu and I are
on good terms again

50
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,454
I'm not the one you should be begging to

51
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,668
If you sincerely apologize to Dong-gyu,

52
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,436
then I'll think about it

53
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:29,522
Okay

54
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:31,947
I'll do that, Ye-ji

55
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:43,188
Hey

56
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,411
What do you think you're doing?

57
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,258
You've been acting strange lately

58
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,823
Say something

59
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:05,798
If you're going to keep quiet again,
you should stop disturbing me

60
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,634
Don't come to my house, don't talk to me,
and don't even call me

61
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,147
I just

62
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:17,272
want you to

63
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,185
get out of my sight

64
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,171
Please

65
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:48,967
give me a hug

66
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:31,032
Are you okay?

67
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,650
No

68
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,115
This won't do

69
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:07,964
What's going on?

70
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,497
Can you tell me now?

71
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:15,597
No

72
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:21,788
Here

73
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,475
Come on

74
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,097
I told you I went through trouble
to get that

75
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:47,663
You're sorry, aren't you?

76
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,204
Say so

77
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,529
That's how I'll know

78
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:55,834
Does it make a difference

79
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,058
if I say it?

80
00:07:58,808 --> 00:07:59,949
It does

81
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,475
Because I'll know

82
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,304
Listen

83
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,378
When I do this,
this is all you have to do

84
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,529
This means I'm angry

85
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,593
It's the worst, I hate it

86
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,259
I'm so sorry

87
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:45,223
Moon Ye-ji is the best
Everything you're saying is right

88
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:53,447
I

89
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:56,048
need you

90
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,497
What are you sorry about?
I told you not to pick this

91
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,336
(Boss)

92
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,299
Hold on

93
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:43,185
Hello?

94
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:46,097
Sorry

95
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,370
I'll be there now

96
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:57,542
Who was that?

97
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:00,562
Wait for me here

98
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:02,152
I'll be right back

99
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:03,686
Where are you going?

100
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:06,766
It won't take long

101
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:36,638
Soo-bin

102
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,141
If you suddenly quit like this...

103
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,527
it's going to be a problem

104
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,260
I keep dozing off at school

105
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,540
and barely finding time
to study for the midterm

106
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,801
I can't do this any longer

107
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:54,091
Then have you thought about the thing

108
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,438
I mentioned to you earlier?

109
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:57,991
Yes

110
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,971
I won't be able to do that, either

111
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,266
But it's nothing big

112
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:13,658
Starting it is the hardest part

113
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,357
But after you start, it's so easy

114
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:20,168
Come on

115
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:51,634
Where are you?

116
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,530
I told you we have to finish this today

117
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:56,453
I'm really sorry,
but let's call it a day

118
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:58,349
Something really important came up

119
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,919
This is really important, too

120
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,423
It's something even more
important than that

121
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,248
Moon Ye-ji

122
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,940
Yes?

123
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:05,481
I'll be waiting

124
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,106
What? Hey!

125
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,777
I'm good at waiting

126
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,125
Yes, I'm on my way now

127
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,587
(Da-eun)

128
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,805
(Soo-bin, where are you?)

129
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:21,747
(You're not picking up)

130
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,049
(Ye-ji)

131
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:09,787
Soo-bin, what's going on?
Why aren't you picking up?

132
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,130
Hello?

133
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,810
Kim Da-eun?

134
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,642
Soo-bin can't pick up now

135
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:38,902
Where is he right now?

136
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,027
Ye-ji

137
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,199
I'll take care of Soo-bin

138
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,907
I'll get you a glass of water

139
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:03,881
You can sit down

140
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:32,401
(Kim Da-eun sent 1,600,000 won
to Cha Soo-bin's DH bank account)

141
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,105
How handsome

142
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:06,076
How long has it been
since we've practiced together?

143
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:08,354
Uh...

144
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:11,983
It's already our 16th day

145
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:16,170
It feels good to be here
because it's just the two of us

146
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:20,783
Let's hurry and practice

147
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:22,945
I have work at 8 PM

148
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,419
You're going to keep working there?

149
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,907
You can pay me back slowly

150
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:38,043
since our relationship is special

151
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:41,881
Our relationship?

152
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,594
We're not even friends

153
00:16:59,023 --> 00:16:59,923
Soo-bin

154
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:04,114
Where's your conscience?

155
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,599
I'm not being greedy

156
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:18,246
All I need is you beside me

157
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:39,158
[Snap and Spark]

158
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:42,344
- Don't hold it like that
- How should I do it, then?

159
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:45,935
(Freshman year, 1st semester)

160
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,017
No, this is wrong

161
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,703
I don't like it

162
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,010
We need 100 pictures
to get a single good one

163
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,395
Da-eun

164
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:18,899
Let's take a picture together

165
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:29,711
What middle school did you go to?

166
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:32,272
Seoul Arts Middle School

167
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:34,297
Oh, you're an elite

168
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:36,237
What major are you?

169
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,410
Piano

170
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:41,301
Wow, I heard there are only
a few piano majors

171
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:44,127
You know him, right?

172
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:45,502
He's Cha Soo-bin

173
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:46,727
He's also a piano major

174
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,597
Hey, Soo-bin!

175
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:53,811
Come here

176
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,096
Da-eun is also a piano major

177
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:06,522
Hi

178
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:08,576
I know you

179
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,921
I heard you're smart
and also good at playing the piano

180
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,540
We could prepare for
the entrance examination together

181
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,167
Okay

182
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:23,318
You two should shake hands

183
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:37,269
Let's take a picture together

184
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:41,343
Hey, Ju-hyuk

185
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:42,826
This is a better spot

186
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:43,926
Come on

187
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:44,751
This is the best spot

188
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,320
Smile

189
00:19:50,345 --> 00:19:51,545
Come on, smile

190
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:55,656
Is that a crown?

191
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:18,973
(To Ye-ji)

192
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:21,260
(Ye-ji, thank you for talking to me)

193
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:24,490
(I was worried I might not have
any friends here, either)

194
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:41,988
(I saw Da-eun put a letter in your
locker last time) (Ye-ji, I'm Han-sol)

195
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,501
(Hi, I'm Ji-soo from the Dance Department)
(I saw Mi-yeon put a letter in your locker)

196
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,400
(Hi, I'm Min-kyung from the classroom next)
(I saw Han-sol put a letter in your locker)

197
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:47,825
(Kids put letters in your locker last night)
(I saw Min-kyung put a letter in your locker)

198
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,481
Five, six, seven, eight

199
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,367
- Yeah
- Yeah

200
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,708
I think this one would look nice

201
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,106
Does it look okay?

202
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,583
You should practice dancing some more

203
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,697
But you've improved

204
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,722
(Hi, Ye-ji)

205
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:19,257
(I'm Sae-na of the Dance Department)

206
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:22,182
(I saw Da-eun put a letter
in your locker last time)

207
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:25,902
(Can you upload a post
about me, too?)

208
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,053
(I think I became the target
in my classroom)

209
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:46,877
- There's something here
- "Take this back"?

210
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:54,335
- Why is that on Ye-ji's locker?
- I don't know

211
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:55,732
Let's go

212
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:04,988
(Why Da-eun and not me?)

213
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:06,613
(How much did Da-eun pay you?)

214
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:21,151
(You have no idea
what I go through every day)

215
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:23,887
(Uploading a picture can't be that hard)

216
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,258
Sae-na

217
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:01,222
You're Kang Sae-na, aren't you?

218
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,919
This is what you mentioned last time

219
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:12,626
Let's take a picture

220
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,998
Don't forget to come today

221
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:23,129
This is for last time

222
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:26,983
Thank you
