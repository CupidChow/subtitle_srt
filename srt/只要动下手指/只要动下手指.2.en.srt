1
00:00:01,531 --> 00:00:02,331
I'm going to...

2
00:00:02,787 --> 00:00:03,987
confess my love

3
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:12,827
to Da-eun

4
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:16,781
Sorry

5
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:20,800
I like Da-eun

6
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:30,131
No!

7
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:31,496
Stop!

8
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:39,398
(Episode 2)

9
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:44,019
Oh, what a nightmare

10
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,703
(Ye-ji)

11
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:48,850
(Are you asleep, Ye-ji?)

12
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,434
(Are you really asleep?)

13
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:52,459
(Moon Ye-ji!)

14
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:54,791
(Ye-ji)

15
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,607
(What is love?)

16
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,284
(Nothing's going as planned T.T)

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,536
I'm the one who wants to cry right now

18
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:20,374
I don't understand

19
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,921
What are you staring at?

20
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:30,931
The sun's in your eyes

21
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:33,461
(Why are you)

22
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:35,211
(still the same?)

23
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,516
The weather

24
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:41,077
is good today

25
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:43,699
It's annoying

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,617
Da-eun

27
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:51,881
Oh

28
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,350
Hi, Ye-ji

29
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,050
What are you doing after school today?

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,550
Me?

31
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,151
I'm just...

32
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:07,695
Let's meet after school

33
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:09,865
at the cafÃ© in front of school

34
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:12,771
(No)

35
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,057
(I'm the one who is still the same)

36
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,347
Did you buy new headphones?

37
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,081
They look nice

38
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:42,574
Hey

39
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:44,784
- Did you call me?
- Yes

40
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,613
Whoa, the noise cancellation is amazing

41
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,060
I didn't hear you at all

42
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,090
- Really? Are they new?
- Yes

43
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,587
These are really light

44
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,778
They're great for practicing

45
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:58,874
I'll specially let you wear them

46
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:01,561
What do you think?

47
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,981
You can't hear anything, right?

48
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:11,253
(Where are you, Sun Ju-hyuk?)

49
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,864
(Get out as soon as they call the roll)

50
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,305
(Guys, stop it)

51
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,085
(Ju-hyuk, you can take your time)

52
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,490
Ye-ji

53
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:52,912
What do you think

54
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:54,956
love is?

55
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:58,256
I don't know

56
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,296
What is it?

57
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:02,551
Love is

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,552
fire

59
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,687
Whenever I see Sae-na...

60
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,813
my heart is on fire

61
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,046
Me, too

62
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:18,697
You, too?

63
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,711
You, too? Why?

64
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:26,942
Oh

65
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:28,348
I see

66
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,028
Guys!

67
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,995
Shocking news!

68
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,820
- What is it?
- What is it?

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,914
Dong-gyu is signing with a company

70
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,414
- Dong-gyu?
- He's signing with an entertainment company

71
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:46,338
- Whoa
- Whoa

72
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:48,497
- You styled your hair
- Where are you going?

73
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,534
- Who did you sign with?
- Hey, look at you

74
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,001
Dong-gyu! Are you really debuting?

75
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,007
- Wow!
- Wow!

76
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,430
You're debuting!

77
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,836
Don't tell me...

78
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:00,148
it's one of the three major companies

79
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,086
- Really?
- Whoa

80
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:02,673
That would be insane

81
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:04,065
- Wow!
- Wow!

82
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,053
It's a new company

83
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,088
They were looking for someone
with my image

84
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:11,554
They said they saw me on Ye-ji's account
and said they'd let me debut soon

85
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,879
I'm also debuting soon

86
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:14,521
Ye-ji's the best

87
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:16,583
- This is crazy
- Ye-ji

88
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:18,380
- Can you upload a picture of me, too?
- Me, too

89
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,892
- Ye-ji, please
- Come on

90
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,917
- Just once
- Me first

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
- Ye-ji, please
- Leave, guys

92
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,526
- I came here first
- No, I was first

93
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:26,575
Just once, please

94
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,855
I was here before you

95
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,262
- Please upload a picture of me
- Please

96
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,675
- Take a selfie with me
- Upload one with me

97
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,439
Hello, everyone

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,886
Get back to your seats

99
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:36,834
- Ah
- Ah

100
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:37,746
Guys

101
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,801
- Ah
- Ah

102
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:42,154
- I want to practice
- Not again

103
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:44,179
I don't like class

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
(Why was I)

105
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,778
(so sure he would like me?)

106
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,634
I'm going to...

107
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,464
confess my love

108
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,910
to Da-eun

109
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,525
What?

110
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,001
Who?

111
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:38,788
So

112
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,462
please do me a favor

113
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,638
Upload a picture

114
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:52,905
Of what?

115
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,042
A picture of Da-eun and me

116
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,388
Say we're an official couple
starting today

117
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:15,958
Darn it

118
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,179
I should go

119
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:23,979
And just so you know,

120
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,713
I don't do favors like that

121
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,560
Adapt is correct, isn't it?

122
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:41,671
- Yes
- Yes

123
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,727
And this part...

124
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:46,048
"Approach" here and

125
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:49,526
through "process and accept the change"...

126
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:53,794
Oh

127
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:54,618
Da-eun

128
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:56,386
Hey

129
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,899
It's smeared

130
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
Ye-ji

131
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:15,464
Thanks

132
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,726
Wow, I have so many followers

133
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,649
The bumping effect is crazy

134
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,968
Oh, not again

135
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,342
Come to school, dude

136
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,894
People will think you dropped out
as soon as you transferred here

137
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,459
Sun-jae

138
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,344
I leveled up

139
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:05,649
I got a call from
TenH Entertainment Company!

140
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:23,486
Why?

141
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,998
What?

142
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,022
What is it?

143
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,238
What's wrong?

144
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:31,904
What?

145
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,609
What a jerk

146
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:02,036
Oh, Ye-ji

147
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,585
What are you doing here?

148
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:07,844
Uh

149
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:10,272
I'm seeing someone here

150
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,552
Who?

151
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,349
Oh

152
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,815
Oh, my bad

153
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:23,420
Have a sweet time together

154
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:24,947
- It's not me
- What?

155
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:26,176
Let's go somewhere else

156
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,756
Oh, hi

157
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,897
You said you were leaving first

158
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,540
I did

159
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,076
I called her

160
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:39,376
You?

161
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,096
Why?

162
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:42,616
Uh...

163
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:43,992
Actually...

164
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,616
No need to ask
Let's go

165
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,945
Bye

166
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:49,202
We're performing
at the arts festival together

167
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:51,662
What?

168
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:52,996
The arts festival?

169
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,783
You two are performing together?

170
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:00,799
Yes

171
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,264
Oh, I see

172
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:04,931
For a second,

173
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:06,635
I thought it was something else

174
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:10,543
Da-eun, why are you so flustered?

175
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:18,042
(I'm working really hard so that
I can do things with the girl I like)

176
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:22,287
Bye

177
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:23,726
Hey, Ye-ji!

178
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,254
Ye-ji

179
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,070
Are you okay?

180
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,096
Can you wait for me?
We'll be over soon

181
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:39,021
Cha Soo-bin

182
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,744
Pick a side

183
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,260
Soo-bin

184
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,174
Are you leaving?

185
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:00,856
No

186
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,429
Let's go back inside

187
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,895
Bye, Ye-ji

188
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:23,843
(It's over)

189
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,221
(Soo-bin let go)

190
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,263
(of my hand)

191
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:40,398
See you guys tomorrow

192
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:44,445
Did you hear?

193
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,281
The Hankuk Arts University
campus is really beautiful

194
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:49,538
They're performing together?

195
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,473
Ye-ji, let's go eat tteokbokki

196
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:03,776
- You can go first
- Ye-ji!

197
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,710
(It's not over for me yet)

198
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:10,561
Why am I not the one?

199
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:21,412
That's just

200
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,732
my choice

201
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:35,723
(Your choice?)

202
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:38,672
(It should've been me)

203
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
(You'll see)

204
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,865
(CEO Kim Chang-yong)

205
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,617
Say hello to our CEO

206
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:48,978
- Hello
- Hello

207
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,030
You don't mind, do you?

208
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,619
I know you guys smoke, too

209
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,624
Yes, it smells good!

210
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,382
If you pick me,
I'm confident I'll do everything I can

211
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:19,130
as best as I can!

212
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,637
We have some interesting players today

213
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,184
Yeah

214
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:47,090
We need someone like him, too

215
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:55,928
Oh, please! Come on!

216
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:58,297
Nice!

217
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,312
Phew

218
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:05,606
Nice

219
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:07,386
- Hey
- What?

220
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,058
Where's Dong-gyu?

221
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,891
He went to sign a contract
with TenH Entertainment

222
00:15:15,118 --> 00:15:17,149
Wow, your life really can
change in an instant

223
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:19,774
Who knew Dong-gyu would be the first one
to succeed like that?

224
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:23,823
I wish Ye-ji would upload
a picture of me, too

225
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:26,630
Huh?

226
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:33,136
Joo Sun-jae!

227
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,510
How could you?

228
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:37,772
I didn't expect this from you

229
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:39,854
Look at this

230
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:41,948
Isn't this you?

231
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,543
#wanted

232
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,916
#Is he alive or not? #Report to me

233
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:49,913
#Please find Joo Sun-jae

234
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:12,880
Hello

235
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,714
This is TenH Entertainment's
recruiting team

236
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:18,339
We were looking for someone
with your image, leave us a reply

237
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,024
- This is not good
- What is it?

238
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,456
Dong-gyu is screwed

239
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:31,681
- Dong-gyu?
- Dong-gyu?

240
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:33,731
Didn't you say he was debuting soon?

241
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,504
- What happened? Tell us
- Come on

242
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,429
You said you even went to his studio

243
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:44,798
Oh, no

244
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:47,373
Ah!

245
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,482
The floor looks good on you

246
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:51,707
Pig

247
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,078
Hey, you pig

248
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,952
You were showing off
saying you became a trainee

249
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:02,307
So why the long face?

250
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,464
Tell us

251
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,805
when you're debuting

252
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:10,305
Hey

253
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,923
Were you so excited
Ye-ji made you popular?

254
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:15,383
I'll show you

255
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,801
where you belong

256
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:19,731
It's right here

257
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,825
The floor that people step on

258
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:26,105
No matter how hard you try
to climb up, this is where you belong

259
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,171
Get it?

260
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:29,582
Huh?

261
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:33,456
What's going on?

262
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,520
He thought he was cast by
an entertainment company

263
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:38,145
but it was an escort pub

264
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:39,796
The whole school knows about it

265
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,350
Joo Sun-jae?

266
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:06,582
Delete it

267
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:09,435
Delete what?

268
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:12,103
My picture

269
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:13,569
Oh

270
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:16,134
What if I don't?

271
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,376
You're trash

272
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,168
What?

273
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:28,194
You sell your friends for money,
so that makes you trash

274
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,679
Look what offering your friend
to those punks did to him

275
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:48,860
Let's go

276
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,563
I said let's go

277
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:57,952
I did it

278
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:05,904
I went to see them myself
because I wanted to

279
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:07,553
What?

280
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,129
Ye-ji, thank you

281
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,799
Although it was brief...

282
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,927
I was really happy

283
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:32,438
I was always looked down on

284
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,631
but for the first time, I felt worthy

285
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,849
It felt good to hear
someone wanted to work with me

286
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,317
I almost said yes

287
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:53,158
I'm going to work really hard now

288
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,251
I'm going to lose weight

289
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,651
and try as hard as I can

290
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,858
to become someone
everyone wants to work with

291
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:08,509
Hey!

292
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:11,677
What's going on?

293
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,014
Joo Sun-jae

294
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:02,128
You cause trouble as soon as you show up

295
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,164
Especially that incident!

296
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:13,806
Why did you pay a fortune and transfer to
this school if you aren't coming to class?

297
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,431
If you keep skipping school,
you're giving me no choice

298
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,856
Either drop out of school,
come to class,

299
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,116
or fail to graduate

300
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:23,775
Those are the options

301
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:30,864
And Ye-ji

302
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:33,716
I told you

303
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:36,061
You should prepare for college
or plan for your future

304
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:37,665
Didn't I tell you that?

305
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,336
Even if you start now,
you'll be pressed for time

306
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,338
Sir

307
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,037
I'm going to perform

308
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:52,331
at the arts festival

309
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:03,602
Hey

310
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:05,213
I'm not deleting your picture

311
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,026
You know me, don't you?

312
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,396
I've seen your videos

313
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:19,864
Help me out just this once

314
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,716
He said you're getting suspended
if you don't come to school!

315
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:27,461
Hey!

316
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,170
Trying hard to achieve something

317
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:42,474
seemed pathetic

318
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:45,833
But I realized that also requires courage

319
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:51,265
I'm going to cheer for myself,
even if I look pathetic trying

320
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:53,279
So help me out

321
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,103
And while you're on it,

322
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:58,403
you could cheer for yourself, too

323
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:01,943
Do you think the world
revolves around you?

324
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,705
Oh, this doesn't work on you

325
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:09,436
Then

326
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:11,849
if you perform with me
at the arts festival,

327
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
I'll delete your picture

328
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,566
What about that?

329
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:15,721
Oh, come on

330
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:16,738
Hey

331
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,709
Are you crazy?

332
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:20,091
I know there's a reason
you transferred to this school

333
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,840
Let's help each other out

334
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,337
as partners

335
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:26,873
Partners?

336
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:30,276
I don't trust anyone

337
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:38,271
I don't trust you, either

338
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,526
It's your skills I trust

339
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:56,704
[Snap and Spark]

340
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,725
Oh, thanks

341
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,130
Really

342
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,306
You went through trouble coming here

343
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,694
Oh, tell your father to come by next week

344
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,711
- Okay
- Alright

345
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,833
- I'll be on my way then
- Take care

346
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:19,386
Huh?

347
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:21,417
Why? Do you know him?

348
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:23,295
No, I don't

349
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,337
He's a student at Hankuk Arts University

350
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:28,935
He's quite talented

351
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:31,422
He'd be a good asset

352
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,515
- Hankuk Arts University?
- Yes
