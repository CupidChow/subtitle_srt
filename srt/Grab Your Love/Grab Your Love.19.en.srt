00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,480
Mr. Qin,

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,920
I've received the

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,760
new dress and lotion.

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,630
Thank you.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,560
You're the first user of
Mu Xi beauty cream.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,520
How does it feel?

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,840
It's better than other
creams on the market.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,880
The scent is pleasant too.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,320
This scent suits you.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,470
So does the brand.

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,230
This cake…

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,350
Do you want a bite?

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
Absolutely not.

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,640
Don't worry.

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,400
I never keep things to myself.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,790
I'll share when it's done.

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,870
No need.

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,400
Though it doesn't look good,

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,310
once the burnt part's off,

28
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,760
inside…

29
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,870
No big problem. I can fix that.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,200
Well done.

31
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,510
(Otherwise, eating this could be fatal.)

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,960
How about

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,870
I bake the cake base?

34
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,280
No need.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
(Did I hurt his pride?)

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,790
Well.

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,400
There's one Cui made this morning.

38
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,480
Perfect.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,430
Is this button

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,470
so valuable to you?

41
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,710
Did its owner

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,470
also bake a cake for you?

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,870
This is from my lifesaver.

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Without him, I wouldn't be here.

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,990
Mr. Qin,

46
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,910
did you just say

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,800
that you made this cake for me?

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
Since you joined our family,

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,470
you've been in deep trouble.

50
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,870
It's just a cake.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,960
Consider it a token of appreciation.

52
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
Mr. Qin,

53
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,430
you've done so much for me.

54
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,710
I remember it in my heart.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,840
Even if you want to be kind,

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,150
just say it.

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,800
I won't take it for granted.

58
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,650
Don't…

59
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,910
Put less cream,

60
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,310
or it might affect the grape aroma.

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Mr. Qin,

62
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,480

are you making ammo or a cake?

Why so slow?

102
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,800

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,510

Is there justice?

111
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,510
Don't show up when you're not needed.

112
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,030

113
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Spit it out.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,000
I lost again. I'm done playing.

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,480
Jiading,

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,510
accept your shortcomings.

118
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,870

If you two got married,

120
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,120
I'd have a tough life.

121
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't talk nonsense.

122
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,310
Great idea.

123
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,750
If we got married,

124
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,270
I could save a lot on tuition.

125
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,390
Mr. Qin, you don't need the money.

126
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,270
Why join in the fun?

127
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,750
I'm a businessman.

128
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,310
I prioritize benefits.

129
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Think about it.

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't want to.

131
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,160
I want to marry someone
who truly loves me,

132
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,600
not someone who wants to
take advantage of me.

133
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,200
(The person who set fire isn't
in Yecheng but in Shencheng.)

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,920
The person who set fire
isn't in Yecheng

135
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,360
but in Shencheng?

136
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,030
Yes.

137
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,160
No wonder we've found

138
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
nothing in Yecheng.

139
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,600
Send more people to check on Mother.

140
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,750
Make sure she's safe at all times.

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Yes.

142
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,160
That arsonist has been
hiding in Shencheng,

143
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,390
causing my people

144
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,120
to waste time in Yecheng.

145
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,680
But he's even more hidden in Shencheng.

146
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,600
I only found out his last name is Lin,

147
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,670
and he used to be a barefoot doctor.

148
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,790
A barefoot doctor named Lin?

149
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,720
I discovered the man

150
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,360
who analyzed medicine for Feng Jingyun

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,870
was also surnamed Lin, Lin Guangyao.

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
He's not only skilled in pharmacology,

153
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
but also the leader of
Shencheng's gang Hongmen.

154
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,870
What a coincidence.

155
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
She even used gang influence

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,320
to win a man over.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
Qin,

158
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,320
aren't you tempted?

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,550
She used all means in the name of love.

160
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,510
I can't handle such a vicious woman.

161
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,960
You're a decent person.

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,870
You aren't swayed by beauty.

163
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,200
There are countless beauties out there.

164
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,080
If someone wants to
seduce me with beauty,

165
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,050
they better know
who they're dealing with.

166
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,200
Feng Jingyun couldn't

167
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,960
be able to invite the Hongmen leader.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,350
There must be something between
the Feng Family and Hongmen.

169
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,910
If you ask me,

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
we might as well bring
Lin Guangyao to light.

171
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,080
I wiped him out.

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,320
It doesn't matter who's behind him.

173
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,790
If anyone dares to back him,

174
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
they're linked to the gangs.

175
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
But we must see

176
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,390
if Lin Guangyao acted
alone about the fire

177
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,670
or if he was directed by someone.

178
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,060
If it involved both gangs and officials,

179
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,550
we'd need a thorough plan.

180
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,120
Enough

181
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,750
of this.

182
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,390
Why?

183
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,480
Qin's business relies on
the Feng's shipping.

184
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,390
Jiang's always follows the right path.

185
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,320
They value profits over human lives.

186
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,550
I don't want you risking
yourselves for me.

187
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,390
What about you?

188
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,390
Are you just going to accept this?

189
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,950
Or are you planning to take risks alone?

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll figure out

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
my family's vendetta myself.

192
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
Xi,

193
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,000
I can help you find a way.

194
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,600
(When will you)

195
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,670
(prioritize yourself?)

196
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,390
Come in.

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,270
Lin Guangyao is a reckless man.

198
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,000
Feng Yuanzhang is powerful.

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,390
Either of them

200
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,390
is beyond

201
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,750
what you can handle alone.

202
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,080
I'll get the Jiang Family to help me.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,480
If you agreed to Jiang Family's help,

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,510
Jiang Dong wouldn't return defeated.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,270
Clearly, you want to handle this

206
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,510
on your own.

207
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,510
In Shencheng, I'm

208
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,510
the only one who can
do something to them.

209
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,630
And Feng Jingyun

210
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,030
got me involved this time.

211
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,720
I can't do nothing.

212
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,480
Mr. Qin,

213
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,670
how will you handle

214
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,150
Feng Jingyun stealing the formula?

215
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,120
It's not my concern.

216
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
But the fire is

217
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,350
related to people's lives

218
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
and is risky.

219
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,120
I can't involve outsiders.

220
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,350
Outsider?

221
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,000
Now you treat me like an outsider?

222
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,450
What else would you expect?

223
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,120
We're just in a business relationship.

224
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,550
Don't you think you're too concerned?

225
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,470
I won't see you off.

226
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,580
