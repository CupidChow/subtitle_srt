Don't you think

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,520
Min Jiangxi and Jiang Dong
are a bit too close?

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,350
Why did you have someone follow her?

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,710
Are you blaming me for interfering?

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,470
But the moment you heard her name,

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,750
you came out with me.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,960
I've warned you

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,390
not to use my name as an excuse

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,710
and meddle in my affairs.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
Don't accuse me of interfering

19
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,280
to hide your intent to
protect Min Jiangxi.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,710
She's my woman.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,000
I can do whatever I want.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,650
Putting aside personal feelings,

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,710
your goods need to be shipped by sea.

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,200
This concerns our family's business.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,120
I won't allow anyone with ill motives

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,760
to affect our mutual interests.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter her hidden motives,

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,120
it's enough as long as I like her.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,870
- But…
- Qian.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,910
Yes.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Take Miss Feng home.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,240
Yes.

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
This way, Miss Feng.

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,120
(Just wait.)

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,310
(I won't lose to Min Jiangxi.)

36
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,990
Come in if you have something to say.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,310
I don't need a doorman.

38
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,710
You're getting bolder.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,960
You dared to meet in secret

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
with my rival behind my back.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,750
Mr. Qin,

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,520
I've been visiting
the Jiang family often

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,280
because my mom is staying there.

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,000
That's how I became like
a sibling to him.

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,710
But aren't you an orphan?

46
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,190
That's not important.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,680
I wanted to clarify

48
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,710
why I met Mr. Jiang today.

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,280
He might have accessed that cream

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,190
due to my oversight.

51
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,280
I need to confront him.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
If he did it,

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,560
I'd make him explain it to you.

54
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,800
What's your relationship
with Jiang Dong?

55
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,150
Will he listen to you?

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,680
Not the kind you're imagining.

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
I heard your conversation
with Jiang Dong.

58
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,750
I believe you.

59
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,710
From today, you don't need
to hide anymore

60
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,200
if you want to visit the Jiang Family.

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,430
Just tell Mr. Chang and

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
let the driver take you.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,150
Thank you for trusting me.

64
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,750
But

65
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,800
I have one more question.

66
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,400
When Jiang Dong asked if you like me,

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,910
why didn't you answer?

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
Because

69
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,030
I…

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Answer me.

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
It's taboo for a tutor to
covet their employer.

72
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,470
Besides

73
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,360
you're the most talented
and beautiful in town.

74
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,120
How could I dare to think otherwise?

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,270
You flattered me so much.

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,270
Are you afraid of losing your job?

77
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,950
Is it that obvious?

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Very obvious.

79
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,790
Don't worry.

80
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,560
I won't let you lose your job.

81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,120
Then I need to work harder.

82
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,720
(I mean so much to her.)

83
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,270
(That's why she's hesitant.)

84
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,230
Hello?

85
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,270
Qin.

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
Jiang Dong?

87
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,710
Dong.

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,670
Dong.

89
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,820
(Prescription)

90
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,990
Is there a problem
with this prescription?

91
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,310
That's strange.

92
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,950
I used it the day she gave it to me.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,950
It worked well.

94
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
(This naive fool.)

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,390
(He was used.)

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,120
The formula's effective.

97
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,000
The problem is it came from Qin.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,070
And Qin is investigating me.

99
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,390
No way. Ding….

100
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Ding?

101
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Did Ding Bining give you this?

102
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,310
I was wrong, Dong.

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,190
Miss Ding gave it to me.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,190
I thought she cared for you and

105
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,060
believed it was fine.

106
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,160
So I passed it to you.

107
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,120
But I didn't know

108
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,950
it was related to Qin.

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Dong, did I

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
bring trouble to you again?

111
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,390
Leave this to me.

112
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,310
You should leave Shencheng.

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll handle the rest.

114
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,870
Darn it.

115
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,560
How dare Ding Bining

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,480
plot against me?

117
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,270
I'll deal with her right now.

118
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,150
Reckless fool.

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,480
She's blaming it on me.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
How could I stay classy?

121
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,720
Ding Bining?

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,480
There's another person with access to
the Universal Ointment

123
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,750
who is close to Ding Bining.

124
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,310
Feng Jingyun?

125
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,230
Miss Min,

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,510
I put the Universal
Ointment in your bag.

127
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,750
Remember to change it on time.

128
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,510
Don't let anyone use
your injury as an excuse.

129
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,680
Good for her.

130
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,040
She even got you involved.

131
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,680
The Feng family lacks
medicinal expertise.

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,190
If they can decipher
my formula precisely,

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
there must be someone guiding them.

134
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
Is there a medical expert in Shencheng

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,270
I don't know of?

136
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,750
If there's a hidden expert in Shencheng,

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,190
it won't bode well

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,920
for our business.

139
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,800
What do you plan to do about it?

140
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,000
Follow the clues

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,390
and find the real mastermind.

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
It'd be best to uproot the Feng Family

143
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,270
who exploits Shencheng's merchants.

144
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,960
Qin,

145
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,000
you're not being discreet.

146
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,310
Don't you want to do it?

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Of course, I do.

148
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,920
They monopolize Shencheng's shipping.

149
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,310
Just because my father

150
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,550
refused to raise medicine prices
to cover shipping costs,

151
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,870
he's forced to do business only in town.

152
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,720
I've wanted to deal with him.

153
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,590
Qin.

154
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

155
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
I realize you're

156
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,240
just and loyal.

157
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
You're a real man.

158
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,830
I've always been like this.

159
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,310
You just noticed?

160
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,640
Don't make me laugh.

161
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm still used to

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,750
your look of wanting to stomp me.

163
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,590
Yes, exactly.

164
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,680
That exact look.

165
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,870
- Keep it up.
- You're sick.

166
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,110
I have a remedy.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,910
One more thing,

168
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,910
why is Min Jiangxi's mom at your house?

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
As you suggested, let's split up.

170
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,700
I'll investigate the Min family fire.

171
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
You know a lot of people.

172
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,510
You'll find out who's
backing Feng Jingyun.

173
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,390
Look into

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
someone skilled in pharmacology

175
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
but disappeared suddenly years ago.

176
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,500
(Mu Xi)

177
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,120
(Anyone who threatens you)

178
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,870
(must be eliminated.)

179
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Mr. Qin,

180
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,750
are these for me?

181
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,870
(What's going on?)

182
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,320
One more thing,

183
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,200
why is Jiangxi's mom at your place?

184
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,120
I can tell you.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,630
But I need a share

186
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
in your ointment.

187
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,230
Deal.

188
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,360
Two years ago,

189
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,200
the Min family faced a big fire.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,510
Some of them died and some separated.

191
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,120
Min Jiangxi has had a tough few years.

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,670
Some neighbors close to the Min family

193
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,360
offered help to her.

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,080
But some affected by the fire

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,360
called her a jinx.

196
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,870
She came to Shencheng to earn money fast

197
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,600
to repay the neighbors' losses.

198
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,120
Mr. Qin, the clothes have been measured.

199
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,910
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

200
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,790
I'll send the finished

201
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,720
garments once done.

202
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
Thank you.

203
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I'll leave you to it.

204
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,870
Wait a minute.

205
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,350
Mr. Qin,

206
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,120
it's almost winter.

207
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,600
I need to be remeasured too

208
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,910
for some winter clothes.

209
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,360
It's okay. Your measurements
were taken last month.

210
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,550
It's accurate.

211
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,750
I've been downsizing lately.

212
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Re-measure it.

213
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,150
You must've gotten a little misty-eyed.

214
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,790
I...

215
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,150
It's okay. I have glasses.

216
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,630
Oops.

217
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Where are my glasses?

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,550
I probably left them at the store.

219
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Miss Min,

220
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,600
can you do it for me?

221
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,390
I may have left my glasses at the store.

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
I...

223
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,390
Didn't you measure them just fine?

224
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
Suddenly I can't see clearly.

225
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,920
How about this?

226
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,870
Get closer.

227
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
It'll be more accurate.

228
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
The clothes will fit better.

229
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,150
You have a busy schedule.

230
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
And you've had to worry about
buying me new clothes.

231
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,870
Shoulder width, 50.

233
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,120
The clothes you brought
with you are outdated

234
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,840
and you wear them to see your mother.

235
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you want her to think

236
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,480
we treat you badly?

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,510
Sleeve length, 67.

238
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,480
Jiang Dong has told me the reason why

239
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,870
your mother is at the Jiang family.

240
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,000
Please keep this confidential, Mr. Qin.

241
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,510
Of course.

242
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,680
Chest circumference.

243
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,260
Then

244
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,870
you should get along with Jiang Dong

245
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,120
as siblings.

246
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,120
(Jiang Dong, the bigmouth.)

247
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,720
Chest circumference, 96.

248
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,600
I guess it's time to measure the neck.

249
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
Why are you blushing?

250
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,840
It's too hot today.

251
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
The autumn night

252
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,720
is indeed hot.

253
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,750
It's almost done.

254
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,240
I shall head back.

255
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Goodbye.

256
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,080
Why are the glasses…

257
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,080
- They…
- Sir.

258
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,720
Glasses shouldn't be in the sleeve.

259
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,120
They can easily break.

260
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
(You're so childish.)

261
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,980
