What did you do to Min Jiangxi?

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,550
I just had a drink with her.

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
Do I need to report to you?

89
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,870

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,610

Got it.

101
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,840
Why should I care about
Min Jiangxi's past?

102
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,790
I'm just curious

103

she care so much about.

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,750
What happened?

106
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,000
Someone used drugs

107
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,030
at the Qin Family.

108
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,030
Qin asked me about it.

109
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,670
You've all been with me for a long time.

110
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,600
You should know the rules.

111
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,790
Maybe Qin is playing tricks.

112
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,390
I'll go find him.

113

114
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,200
Don't follow me. I'll go alone.

115

Mr. Dong, it was me.

116
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,480
I did it.

117
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,910
What did you use?
