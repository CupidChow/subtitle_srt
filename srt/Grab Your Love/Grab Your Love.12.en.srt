you're a good match for my uncle.

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,870
would you be with him?

40
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,000
You seem to have a lot of free time.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,750
It seems like I gave you

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,470
too little homework.

43
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,520
Women are terrifying.
Can we have a nice talk?

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,710
Cui, where's the nearby market?

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,680
Miss Min, you're being arrogant.

46
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,360
Miss Min, the watermelon looks nice.

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,600
- Let's buy one.
- Watermelons.

48
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,900
- Sure, let's take a look.
- Sweet watermelon.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Have a look.

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,070
Miss, take a look. They're sweet.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
Boss, is the melon tasty?

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,030
Yes, it's sweet.

53
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,080
- Miss, try it.
- That tutor…

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,030
- flirted with Mr. Qin
- This is nice.

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,960
and Mr. Jiang at the same time.

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,590
She's really something.

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,310
She appears virtuous in public,

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,470
but secretly sells charm for gain.

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,680
Don't insult from the shadows. Speak up.

60
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,560
If you dare to act, I dare to speak.

61
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,150
In broad daylight,

62
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,310
do you dare to silence me?

63
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,470
Come see. Come look!

64
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,680
She wants to

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,080
sleep with the Young Masters.

66
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,240
Take a look of herself.

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,280
Crazy woman, I'll shut you up!

68
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,310
Vixen!

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,870
What bad luck.

70
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,280
I have no grudge against you.

71
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,470
You can't attack me without reason.

72
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,680
Who taught you to say that?

73
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,470
No one taught me. I figured it out.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
Keep an eye on your men.

75
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't let that Vixen enchant them.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,430
- You!
- Cui.

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,800
Let's go.

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
Does she think

79
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,870
I went crazy from the fever?

80
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,350
Miss Min.

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,270
Change your clothes, I'll wash them.

82
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,190
No worries, I'll handle it.
You go ahead.

83
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,030
Alright.

84
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,680
Can't you knock before
entering a lady's room?

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,510
There wasn't a woman living here before.

86
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm not used to it.

87
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,670
Sorry about that.

88
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,880
Are you done?

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,910
Not yet.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
Now I am.

91
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,870
Why so grumpy

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,680
after going out?

93
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,480
I was affected by some personal issues.

94
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,270
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,390
What personal issues?

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,950
Where are the grapes you promised?

97
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,690
Do you still remember it?

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,310
I have a cold, not amnesia.

99
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,160
The fruits weren't fresh, so I skipped.

100
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,360
Then when you kissed me…

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,390
My head hurt.

102
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,800
I didn't remember everything.

103
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,390
What did you just say?

104
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,150
Nothing.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,480
Your necklace pendant is unique.

106
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,870
Does it have special meaning?

107
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,720
That's also a personal issue.

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Mr. Qin,

109
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,870
last night's incident was an accident.

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,120
I won't get tangled up with you over it.

111
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,310
I'll remember your kindness.

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,560
But please forget

113
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,030
the process.

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
Min Jiangxi,

115
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
what do you take me for?

116
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,450
Now you're discarding me?

117
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,720
Miss Min.

118
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,190
Uncle, why are you here?

119
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,270
Can't you knock before
entering a lady's room?

120
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,190
Sorry, Miss Min, we…

121
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,630
There wasn't any women here before.

122
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,920
You're not used to it.

123
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,900
How did you know
what I was going to say?

124
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,240
You burst in loudly.

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
What's going on?

126
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,480
Cui said someone dared to

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,390
so bad things to my tutor.

128
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,480
Come on, I'll help you get revenge.

129
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,240
Jiading, this is an adult matter.

130
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,800
I have my way of handling it.

131
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,160
Using violence isn't the solution.

132
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,910
What's going on?

133
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Mr. Qin, I'd like to handle this myself.

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,440
Miss Min,

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,680
there's a call for you downstairs.

136
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,160
Okay, I'll be right there.

137
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,470
Uncle,

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,450
they're bullying our family.
You can't ignore it.

139
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,190
Did you memorize the book
I asked you to?

140
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,870
I'll test you when I get back.

141
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,270
Got it.

142
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,950
Miss Min.

143
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,310
Ding Bining?

144
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,160
Congratulations, Miss Min.

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
You've become a star in Shencheng.

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,510
So it was you.

147
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
Where are you?

148
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,680
Why does it matter to you?

149
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,070
You still dare to challenge me?

150
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,390
Name a place, see if I dare.

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
Yunshan Pavilion.

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,560
Yunshan Pavilion.

153
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,720
Mr. Chang, where is Miss Min going?

154
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,360
She just got a call

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,720
and said she was going to
Yunshan Pavilion.

156
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,750
Qian, get the car ready.

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
Wait.

158
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,510
Young Master, you're still unwell.

159
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
Ning, why are we doing this

160
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,390
at Mr. Qin's place?

161
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,960
Mr. Dong can't see her
embarrassing herself.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
Yunshan Pavilion is

163
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,120
the news center in Shencheng.

164
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,480
I want Min Jiangxi

165
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
to lose face here

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,870
and make sure she can't stay here.

167
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
You're beautiful and smart.

168
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,000
How can she compare to you?

169
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,510
You actually dared to come?

170
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,440
No wonder people talk about you…

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,670
Vixen, you dared to hit me?

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,670
What's there to fear about

173
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
hitting a gossipmonger?

174
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,000
You dare challenge Ning?

175
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,670
Which graveyard exploded

176
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
and some ghosts popped out?

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,150
Why do you look so odd?

178
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,080
Min Jiangxi, you lack courage.

179
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,930
It's between us.

180
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,480
Why bring a man here?

181
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,390
You're quite a coward too,

182
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,910
afraid of one-on-one.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're not worth Ning's effort.

184
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,870
Why not all three of you come at me?

185
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,870
He's not going to fight.

186
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,270
He's just here for the aftermath.

187
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,790
Still talking tough at the end?

188
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,440
I'll take you down today,

189
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,390
or I'll lose my name.

190
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,700
Let's not get ahead of yourselves.

191
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
I'll number your bones first.

192
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,150
My friend's quite strong.

193
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,360
She may scatter you soon and

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
you won't piece back together.

195
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,440
Don't think you can prove

196
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
you're loyal by slandering me.

197
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,480
Let go of my hand now!

198
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,200
I'll teach you a lesson today.

199
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,750
Should we call Mr. Qin?

200
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,270
- We can't mess with them.
- Stop.

201
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,480
- Just ignore it.
- Let go.

202
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,630
Let's go.

203
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,450
- Stop spreading rumors.
- You're hurting me.

204
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,750
- You're hurting me.
- I mean it.

205
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,870
I thought you wouldn't use force.

206
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,200
- It hurts.
- Come here.

207
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,120
Let go.

208
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,990
- I didn't use my hands.
- Let go.

209
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,350
Come here.

210
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't touch me.

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,100
Don't think of running.

212
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Hit me? No one shall leave.

213
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,360
How dare you say that.

214
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,750
How dare you say that.

215
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,440
Yes!

216
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,120
- I'll help.
- Wait up.

217
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,600
Hit them.

218
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,200
Let her vent a bit.

219
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,240
Let go of me!

220
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,600
You're not smart enough for this.

221
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,670
Who told you to do this?

222
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,750
No one instructed me.

223
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,030
You have too many enemies.

224
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,630
Many people want to get you.

225
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,600
Watch out, Xi!

226
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,510
Whose side are you on?

227
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,870
Ning, I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

228
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
You hit hard. Thanks.

229
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,750
Spill it.

230
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,630
Who made you do it?

231
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,270
I apologize.

232
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,960
I shouldn't pay people to slander you.

233
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,800
Is that alright?

234
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,690
Move.

235
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,960
Anyone who spreads rumors
about me will face this.

236
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,870
Xi, they're still breathing.

237
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,300
I don't think I need to clean it up.

238
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,670
- Ding Bining.
- Let go of me.

239
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,720
How dare you do that?

240
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,480
Xi, stop fighting.

241
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,390
Is my face hurt?

242
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,870
Quick, take me to the hospital.

243
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
Don't mess with me.

244
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,990
Let's go.

245
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Mr. Qin.

246
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,320
You fought with my people

247
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,510
in my territory.

248
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,840
I didn't start it. She hit me first.

249
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,690
You brought them here.

250
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,600
You know what your attempts are.

251
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,320
This needs to be settled.

252
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,200
But I don't hit women.

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,950
Thanks for your understanding, Mr. Qin.

254
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,390
Handle it yourselves.

255
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,510
If there's no blood in fifteen minutes,

256
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,870
none of you can leave.

257
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,870
Begin.

258
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,230
Harder.

259
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,750
Keep your eyes on them.

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,080
I remember you chased after

261
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,750
the guy who drew on your book

262
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,510
for two blocks.

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,510
But since that big fire,

264
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,670
you've been holding everything in.

265
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm worried you'll get sick from it.

266
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,480
Even a cornered rabbit fights back.

267
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
Now that things are out in the open,

268
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,390
I won't be

269
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,320
an easy target anymore.

270
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,590
I'm with you.

271
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,320
I'll watch you go inside.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,670
I'm worried someone might jump out

273
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,200
and try to bother you.

274
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,670
Open your eyes wide.

275
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,440
This is the Qin Family.

276
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,720
Who dares cause trouble here?

277
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,360
Alright.

278
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,270
You're still a handsome guy,

279
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
even with those injuries.

280
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm worried about you going back alone.

281
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,600
You haven't found a boyfriend yet.

282
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,670
Are you interested in me?

283
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,670
Relax, you're not my type.

284
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,480
Alright, hurry inside.

285
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,200
- Go on.
- Goodbye, handsome guy.

286
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,710
Here you go.

287
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,120
Miss Min, what happened to your hand?

288
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,440
It's nothing.

289
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,200
Don't hide it.

290
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,750
Come over here.

291
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,320
Jiading, go to the study
and get my medicine.

292
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,120
- Sure.
- I have medicine here.

293
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,510
This medicine only
reduces inflammation, not scars.

294
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Uncle.

295
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,120
I'll do it myself.

296
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
Don't move.

297
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,670
Mr. Qin, I hit Ding Bining

298
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,000
today at Yunshan Pavilion.

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
I know.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,200
Right, that's your place.

301
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,120
Who said

302
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,200
violence isn't the answer?

303
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,270
Sometimes it works, though.

304
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,550
But don't follow my lead.

305
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm not a kid.

306
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,320
I understand your reasons.

307
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,670
I won't blindly follow.

308
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,320
You seem so gentle,

309
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,000
but you're quite brave.

310
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,360
It's just appearances.

311
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,510
Does it hurt?

312
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,790
It doesn't hurt at all.
What's this medicine?

313
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,670
I spent a lot on this

314
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,600
exclusive TCM formula.

315
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,240
It reduces inflammation
and speeds up healing

316
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,120
without leaving scars.

317
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,320
Why doesn't it have a name?

318
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,720
I haven't decided yet.

319
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
You dislike taking medicine

320
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,310
but are in the pharmaceutical business.

321
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,880
Those foreigners inflate prices

322
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,680
and monopolize markets.

323
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,070
I want to pave a new way
with this medicine,

324
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,310
so people won't suffer

325
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,480
due to unaffordable drugs.

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,110
Uncle said

327
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,590
he wanted to help drive those

328
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,110
ruthless foreigners out of the country.

329
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,960
(Is he really evil?)

330
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,520
What are you thinking?

331
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm thinking

332
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,270
you've built such a big empire,

333
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,400
but you still work so hard.

334
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,680
It's inspiring.

335
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,920
The world is uncertain.
We can't rely on heritage.

336
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,350
We must explore more paths.

337
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,300
Keep your hands steady.

338
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,110
I'll get you a bandage.

339
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,310
You hit the daughter of Qin's partner.

340
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,110
I'm curious how you'll handle it.

341
