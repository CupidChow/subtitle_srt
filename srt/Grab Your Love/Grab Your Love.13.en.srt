00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
Zhan.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,360
Miss Feng,

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
what brings you here so late?

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,750
I heard Miss Min was injured.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,150
I know some top tutors

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,960
who can take over her classes.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,030
My uncle used
the miracle medicine on Miss Min

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,240
before it was released.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
She doesn't need your concern
for such minor injuries.

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,480
(I can't believe Zhan
trusts her so much.)

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,240
Besides, it's not

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
up to you to decide for my uncle

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,310
on Miss Min's stay.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
Miss Feng and Miss Ding
are like sisters.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,280
She's so hurt.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,070
Instead of caring for her,

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,230
you're eager to replace me.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,790
No one would believe it if you say this

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
has nothing to do with you.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,840
You sharp-tongued woman.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,510
How dare you try to blame me?

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,120
If I let you stay by Zhan's side,

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,680
it just shows my incompetence.

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,680
You make enemies everywhere for a man

33
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,710
who doesn't love you.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,870
Not a wise move.

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,040
This is just the beginning,

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,510
and you're panicking?

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
True.

38
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,760
After all, I can achieve

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,200
far more than you can

40
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,350
in Shencheng.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,760
Can you make Mr. Qin like you?

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,350
Mr. Qin doesn't like you

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,030
not because of me,

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,240
but because you don't impress him.

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,520
It's not your place

46
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,630
to judge us.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,430
The Qin Family

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,630
doesn't need an outsider's opinion.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,470
The Ding and Qin Families
have a long partnership.

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
She talked like this.

51
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,470
Do you want our family to think

52
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,400
you're using her

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,710
to cut ties with our family?

54
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,030
Ask Ding Bining why she spreads

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,750
rumors about our family
because of personal matters.

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,430
Is her father sending her

57
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,680
to sever ties with our family?

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,240
That's not what I mean.

59
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,520
Min Jiangxi is on my side.

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,430
Whoever is upset with her

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,960
is upset with me.

62
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
I dislike troublemakers.

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,870
If there's an issue, bring it on.

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,630
She acts so recklessly.

65
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,710
If you keep her,

66
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,750
your family might gain a bad reputation.

67
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,590
What?

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,960
Did your father send you

69
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,120
to cut ties with the Qin Family too?

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
The Qin Family doesn't need a martyr.

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,430
Not responding isn't my style.

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,630
You did well.

73
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,120
I'll remember Mr. Qin's advice.

74
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,550
Miss Min,

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,150
I put the Universal Ointment
in your bag.

76
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
Change it on time.

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Don't let anyone use
your injury as an excuse.

78
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,520
Since Miss Min is fine,

79
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,910
I'm relieved.

80
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Zhan,

81
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,710
I'm heading back.

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
I won't see you off.

83
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,470
Be careful not to get

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,190
your injury wet.

85
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,150
Got it.

86
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,070
What a rare guest.

87
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,240
Miss,

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,830
what brings you here?

89
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,390
Check the ingredients of this medicine.

90
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,870
I need the detailed formula.

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
These are rare herbs.

92
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,950
But they're made into paste.

93
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,600
It'll take some effort

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,310
to find the formula.

95
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,910
I want the answer

96
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,560
in three days.

97
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,270
Okay.

98
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,870
Leave it to me.

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
Mr. Qin,

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,430
the bottle factory is arranged.

101
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,680
Now we just need a name
for the medicine.

102
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,160
Please come up with one.

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,270
Let's use this one.

104
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,040
Do you have good news recently?

105
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,310
I noticed you've been
in a great mood lately.

106
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,620
(Mu Xi)

107
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Mu Xi.

108
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Good.

109
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,200
- Add this too.
- Sure.

110
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,450
Mom, how's the selling going?

111
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,550
We still have some at home.

112
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,640
- Okay.
- Here you are.

113
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,520
Alright.

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,440
I'll weigh it for you.

115
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,070
Alright, that's it.

116
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,990
Please pack it up.

117
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
- It's hot.
- Okay.

118
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,430
Does this look alright to you?

119
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,480
Move aside!

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,550
- Where's the protection fee?
- Go, go!

121
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,670
Hand over the money.

122
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,680
Give it to me.

123
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,310
Return my wallet.

124
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,430
Without a protection fee,

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
you can't set up here.

126
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,680
I paid the stall fee.

127
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Why can't I do business here?

128
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,270
Let me tell you.

129
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,750
Stall fee and protection fee

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,040
both need to be paid.

131
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,150
Stop pretending.

132
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,750
Cut the nonsense, hit him.

133
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,030
Stop it!

134
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,870
Miss Ding.

135
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,600
How dare you bully others

136
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,070
in broad daylight?

137
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,120
Do you have a death wish?

138
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
It's a misunderstanding.

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
Get lost, now!

140
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,230
Let's go.

141
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,640
What are you looking at?

142
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,910
Move along.

143
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,870
Thank you, Miss Ding.

144
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,350
Thanks.

145
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,910
Wait.

146
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,160
Are you Jiang Dong's people?

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,150
You've got the wrong person.

148
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
You were often with him.

149
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,270
I'm sure I didn't mistake you.

150
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm begging you

151
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
not to tell Dong.

152
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,560
I don't want him to worry.

153
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,120
You've injured your arm.

154
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,480
It will be difficult

155
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
to survive here.

156
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,560
This secret remedy heals many injuries.

157
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
It was meant for Jiang Dong.

158
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
Now it might not be needed.

159
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Miss Ding,

160
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,560
you just saved me.

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
It's already a huge favor.

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,950
This is too valuable.

163
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,070
I can't accept it.

164
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,270
It's just a burden

165
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,120
that makes me miss him.

166
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,950
Consider it my good deed.

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Thank you, Miss Ding.

168
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,560
No need for thanks.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
But you must promise me

170
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,480
not to tell him it's from me.

171
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,360
I don't want him to know

172
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,720
that I still can't forget him.

173
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,120
(I hope this loyal dog
won't let me down.)

174
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,840
This time, I'll outdo Qin.

175
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,680
Dong.

176
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,680
Qiu Jie?

177
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,150
How did you end up like this?

178
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,120
Did you spend the money I gave you?

179
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
No.

180
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,790
I came in a hurry.

181
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
I didn't get to dress decently.

182
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,510
By the way,

183
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,030
doesn't Qin also do TCM business?

184
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,870
I found a great remedy.

185
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,270
It makes my bone pain gone

186
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,120
on rainy days.

187
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,510
Take it.

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,870
See if it can outshine his.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,870
There are remedies I don't know of?

190
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,940
(Prescription)

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
Incredible.

192
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,550
This is incredible.

193
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Take me to meet this miracle doctor.

194
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,350
It's just

195
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,510
an old home remedy.

196
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,990
What a pity.

197
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,870
I wanted to learn more.

198
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,150
This is a priceless prescription

199
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,320
and you just gave it to me?

200
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,590
I…

201
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,510
I think it's just a piece of paper

202
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,870
if I keep it.

203
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,030
I believe you can use it.

204
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,360
So I brought it to you.

205
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,750
Dong, I can't.

206
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,500
Let's keep things separate.

207
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,120
What you gave me before

208
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
is enough for my retirement.

209
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,170
I can't take more.

210
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,670
What, you want more?

211
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
No.

212
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,590
Thank you, Dong.

213
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,510
I'll accept it then.

214
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,510
I may not like Qin,

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,270
but I must admit

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,150
that he's incredible.

217
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,700
I've been secluded here for two weeks

218
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,840
to find a new formula.

219
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,360
With this,

220
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,750
our Dong Xing Pharmacy

221
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,550
can surely reach new heights.

222
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Two weeks?

223
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,270
Then you probably don't know

224
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,510
that Miss Min and
Ding Bining had a fight.

225
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,350
What?

226
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,910
Her sidekick,

227
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,510
the one named Lu,

228
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,910
got hurt.

229
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,200
No way.

230
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,440
How dare she!

231
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,870
This sneaky guy invited us out.

232
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,080
He must be up to no good.

233
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,480
We better be careful.

234
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,870
You dared to speak ill of me.

235
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,670
Mr. Jiang, did you ask me to be here

236
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,030
to apologize to me?

237
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,870
Yes.

238
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,130
I owe you apologies for two things.

239
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,670
First, the night of Qin's birthday.

240
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,200
There is something I don't know?

241
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,650
Come on, spill it.

242
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,360
It's just a minor incident.

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,270
Even though it wasn't my idea,

244
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,840
I can't entirely escape blame

245
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
in the end.

246
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,910
Judging by your expression,

247
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,240
Qin must not have told you this secret.

248
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
That sly fox.

249
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,750
I'll trust you for now.

250
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,080
Second, Ding Bining spread rumors

251
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,080
and you got hurt.

252
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,750
I'll get justice for you.

253
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,630
Let's put this behind us.

254
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,150
No need to dwell on it, Mr. Jiang.

255
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,360
Put it behind?

256
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,670
The scar on my face is still there.

257
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,270
If you weren't flirting around,

258
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,870
would your girlfriend

259
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,870
insult everyone she saw?

260
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,150
Firstly, she's my ex-girlfriend.

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,670
Secondly, I'm petty.

262
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,550
I can't put this behind me.

263
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,870
How do you want to handle it then?

264
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,630
Both things started because of me.

265
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,270
As compensation,

266
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,900
I'll look after you from now on.

267
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,750
Is it good to have a villain
look after us?

268
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,030
It's like a dream come true for most

269
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,240
to have the Jiang's only heir guard you.

270
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,390
Mr. Jiang,

271
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
we better not aim too high.

272
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,510
I know you're worried that
Qin might not be pleased for

273
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,800
getting too close to his enemy.

274
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,680
Don't worry.

275
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,480
I wouldn't use a girl
to strike at my enemy.

276
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,320
I simply want you

277
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,270
to try my mom's cooking tonight.

278
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,550
You won't even agree to a meal.

279
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,200
I don't think you've put it behind.

280
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
I'll publish an apology now…

281
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,560
Mr. Jiang.

282
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,750
Publish an apology or dinner.

283
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,440
Publishing an apology

284
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,030
is like putting us under fire.

285
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,750
I choose

286
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
the dinner.

287
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,440
She already agreed.

288
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,960
Stop hesitating.

289
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
Just go.

290
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,720
You're outnumbered.

291
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,870
Just accept it.

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Accept…

293
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,710
You!

294
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,030
A little scar

295
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,670
adds your character.

296
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,920
It's not ugly.

297
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Thank you.

298
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,480
My mom is from Yecheng too.

299
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,360
She cooks amazingly.

300
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,630
If you enjoy it,

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
come often then.

302
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
It's free.

303
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,590
Let's go.

304
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,480
You made so many dishes.

305
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,150
Don't tire yourself out.

306
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,440
Dong always

307
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
finds work for you.

308
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,630
I'm not that fragile.

309
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,840
It's Dong's first time
bringing friends home.

310
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
I have to treat them well.

311
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,870
I just don't remember many dishes.

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
I don't think these are enough.

313
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,590
Dong.

314
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,120
Dad, Mom.

315
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,870
Mom.

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,510
Ms. Ruying?

317
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,240
Are you…?

318
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,300
