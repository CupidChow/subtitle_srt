00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,790
Young Master, is there
anything else you need

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,320
for today's birthday party?

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,960
Today's guests are herbal experts.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,600
Be attentive.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Got it.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,000
Clean it thoroughly.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,400
Yes.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,110
I've told you many times.

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,030
Don't place the statue there. Move it.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,440
Alright.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,000
Be careful.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,430
Don't stain it with your blood.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,310
I'm sorry, Miss Feng.

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,230
Such bad luck.

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,920
Our family hired the servants.

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,230
I don't need others to boss around.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Zhan,

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,710
I'm just worried

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,430
blood is unlucky on a happy day.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,000
It's truly unlucky

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,760
to hear someone shout in my home

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
on a happy day.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,230
Young Master, all the guests are here.

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,560
We can begin now.

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,230
Where's Miss Min?

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,350
Miss Min is here.

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,030
Happy birthday, Mr. Qin.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,470
Thank you.

37
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,030
I picked this outfit,
nice choice, right?

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
Hmm.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,750
The button necklace is unique.

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,990
Zhan.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
All the guests have arrived.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,250
We're waiting for you to start.

43
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,190
Thank you for coming to my party.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,240
Wishing everyone success and health.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,120
Happy birthday, Mr. Qin.

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
Cheers.

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,920
Happy Birthday.

48
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,150
Zhan,

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,310
come cut the cake.

50
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,000
Qin.

51
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,840
Isn't that Mr. Jiang?

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,310
Happy birthday.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,870
Mr. Jiang.

54
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,840
Isn't that Mr. Jiang?

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Yes.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,520
(Jiang Dong actually came.)

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,840
(It seems my plan worked.)

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,590
Why are you here?

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,310
You're into herbal business now.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,560
As a senior from a TCM family,

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,560
I'll lower myself to celebrate with you.

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,580
(Strong Power Pills)

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,310
This is my family's signature tonic.

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,400
Strong Power Pills.

65
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,240
You're so popular, you might need it.

66
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,340
(Strong Power Pills)

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,750
Aren't I considerate?

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,960
I appreciate it.

69
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,120
But I don't need this.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,030
You can use your own products.

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,750
See, you're exhausted
yet still acting tough.

72
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,960
Pack it up for Qin.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
No one comes without a reason.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,630
Tell me, why are you here?

75
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,310
I'm looking for Min Jiangxi.

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
Min Jiangxi?

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
He's here to see you?

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,480
Min Jiangxi.

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Let's go.

80
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,800
Where is she?

81
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't embarrass yourself.

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
She doesn't seem to want to see you.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,390
That's impossible.

84
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,360
We just met at noon.

85
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,000
She gave me a perfume.

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,950
It's your birthday today.
What did she give you?

87
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,510
It looks like she gave you nothing.

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,750
Losing to me

89
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,310
isn't shameful.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,070
Stop using your tricks

91
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,430
on her.

92
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,120
She's not falling for it.

93
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,310
Who are you to her?

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,750
Why guard her door?

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,310
I'm no one to her.

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,360
But if you touch her,

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,950
I'll make you leave flat.

98
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,430
Zhan,

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,430
you left all the guests waiting.

100
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,240
Are you planning to skip drinks?

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Sorry, everyone.

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Cheers.

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

104
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,830
- Let's toast.
- Please, enjoy.

105
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Cheers.

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
- Come on.
- Come on.

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,630
Happy birthday, Mr. Qin.

108
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,470
Thank you.

109
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,880
I didn't expect you'd actually come.

110
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
Bear with me in the future.

111
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,120
You came to invite me.

112
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,240
How could I decline?

113
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,310
Min Jiangxi has a knack.

114
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,000
When I invited you,

115
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,070
you were reluctant.

116
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,750
Let's keep our secret

117
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,800
in the wine.

118
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
I appreciate your attention.

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,390
Though Jiang Dong and my Uncle
are called Shencheng Double Villains,

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,160
their characters are worlds apart.

121
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,430
You must stay vigilant.

122
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,190
Be careful not to stray.

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,950
I barely know Mr. Jiang.

124
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,950
No chance of deep ties.

125
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,000
I trust

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,190
your judgment.

127
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,750
Of course.

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,430
Oh, here you are.

129
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,040
Mr. Jiang.

130
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,000
A toast to you, please.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
Are you avoiding me?

132
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
No, when did you arrive?

133
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,300
I'll excuse myself for now.

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,180
Thanks a lot.

135
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,790
Zhan.

136
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,470
Mr. Zhang.

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,600
This is Mr. Zhang.

138
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
- His factory is huge.
- Mr. Qin.

139
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,480
Stop fooling me. Have a drink.

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,560
Dong, the drinks are here.

141
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,430
The woman I fancy sure can drink.

142
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,990
Next time, I'll take you to my place...

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,190
Uncle Jiang, you haven't
tried the cake yet.

144
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,430
This kid is much more sensible than Qin.

145
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Please have some.

146
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,920
This outfit is brand new.

147
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,600
Uncle Jiang, I didn't mean it.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
You won't be mad at me, right?

149
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,480
There's no good person in your family.

150
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,240
Let's go home.

151
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Yes.

152
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,670
Mr. Qin,

153
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,950
our factory needs your support.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,430
You're clever.

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,190
I've had a bit too much.

156
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll go for a walk. Enjoy yourself.

157
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,910
Mr. Qin.

158
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,920
Have a seat.

159
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,750
No toast on your boss's birthday,

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,840
and you're hiding here for peace.

161
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm surrounded by rumors.

162
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,000
I shouldn't overshadow the host

163
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,600
on such an important day.

164
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,320
Rumors chase like dogs.

165
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,000
The more you hide, the fiercer they get.

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,910
Try not to use that as an excuse often.

167
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,390
Alright.

168
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,320
I sincerely wish you

169
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,630
a prosperous year.

170
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,790
I'm a medicine seller.

171
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
Success isn't a good thing.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,960
Let me rephrase that.

173
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I wish you happiness always.

174
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,960
Cheers.

175
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
That's all?

176
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
Where's the gift?

177
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,870
I almost forgot.

178
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,710
Here you go.

179
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
What's this?

180
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,440
Open it and see.

181
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,000
I see you often fiddle with a lighter

182
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,790
but never actually use it.

183
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,720
I thought it might be broken,

184
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
so I got you a new one from the store.

185
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,350
It's not broken.

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,200
I just don't smoke.

187
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,320
So, does this

188
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,960
have a special meaning?

189
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,050
Then I'll get something else.

190
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,600
It's just a lighter.

191
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,790
