9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,350
We arrived early.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,640
Nice to meet you, Miss Min.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,960
My name is Jiang Dong.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,350
Miss Min's beauty is renowned.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,110
Mr. Jiang, you're too kind.

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,710
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,710
(Rude fellow)

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,120
Mr. Jiang, I've heard much about you.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,870
I'm a director, Lu Yuchi.

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,870
Hello, Yuchi.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
Lu.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,710
Just call me Lu.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm surnamed Lu, the Yu of
"encountering the wrong person",

23
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,430
and the Chi of "always being late".

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,870
You're funny.

25
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,120
Then I'm Jiang, from the idiom
"Jiang Lang has used up his talent",

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,650
and Dong indicating I'm a bad person?

27
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,120
(He's quite amusing though.)

28
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,510
Hasn't Miss Feng arrived?

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm the star tonight.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,640
She'll be here later.

31
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,680
No need to stand.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Please sit down.

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,870
Come, you two are the stars.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,510
Sit closer.

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,310
We are just guests.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,030
We won't interrupt your discussion.

37
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,150
Miss Ding.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,800
Miss Ding, this is the script.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,910
Please have a look first.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,630
Qin is as sharp as a monkey.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,470
Working for him must be tiring.

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,710
Why not join me?

43
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,190
I'll double your salary.

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,870
Mr. Jiang, how old is your child?

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,240
No children yet.

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,520
But here is a humble,

47
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,310
handsome young man.

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,430
I can teach anyone aged 6 to 18.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,590
How about having one now?

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,030
Let's meet in six years then.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Are you urging me to get married

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,630
on my father's behalf?

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
If you're willing to marry,

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,470
I might just consider it.

55
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,870
Mr. Jiang, excuse my frankness,

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,870
I know why you're here today.

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,280
Go ahead, I'm listening.

58
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,870
You and Mr. Qin aren't ordinary people.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,590
You have conflicts.

60
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,000
Can you not involve me?

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,470
It's one thing to look good,

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,470
but you're so sharp-minded too.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,590
It makes me want to
compete with Qin even more.

64
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,030
Where's this weird smell coming from?

65
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,190
It's stinging my eyes.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,240
Who are you talking about?

67
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,240
No one's owning up?

68
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,430
Weren't you chatting happily?

69
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,000
Why go silent all of a sudden?

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,470
Stop being cryptic.
Just say it straight.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,590
I'm talking about Min Jiangxi.

72
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,680
Who are you to defend her like this?

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,470
Do I need to explain to you?

74
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,630
(Such a foolish woman.)

75
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,910
Min Jiangxi, you're nothing but a

76
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,710
sly woman who gets weak around men.

77
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,240
- Who…
- Who are you calling sly?

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm talking about Min Jiangxi.

79
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,910
Why, are you a frequent visitor too?

80
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,360
You're sly.

81
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,750
You see everyone as the same kind.

82
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,590
You…

83
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,800
Are you done?

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,640
No.

85
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,000
Min Jiangxi, let me tell you,

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,310
don't be fooled by him.

87
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
He doesn't like you.

88
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,590
He just enjoys competing with
Qin Zhan over women.

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
Ding Bining.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,470
You threw yourself at Qin

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,030
but he ignored you.

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,870
So you came to me.

93
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,720
We parted on good terms.

94
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,870
Stop clinging to me like a nuisance.

95
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,360
Why care who I talk to?

96
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,510
Jiang Dong, how can you say that to me

97
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,630
for her?

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Which word did I wrong you with?

99
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,000
Miss Ding's story is gripping.

100
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,750
Sadly, we walk different paths.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,190
You don't have to

102
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,040
imagine my path.

103
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,870
Jiang Dong,

104
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,040
you can't handle her.

105
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,600
You're a scumbag,

106
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,480
always going for the flashy ones.

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Exactly, I don't like clingy types.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Then why don't you just leave?

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,430
I won't make things easy for you.

110
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,070
Don't mind her.

111
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,190
- It's nothing.
- The lead actress stormed off because of me.

112
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,830
She'd only ruin my work.

113
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,480
Ding Bining said

114
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,070
tonight's event was organized
by Feng Jingyun?

115
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Yes.

116
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,390
Then are you aware

117
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,190
of Feng Jingyun's connection with Qin?

118
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,210
I'm not interested in my

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
employer's personal affairs.

120
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,270
Let me take a guess then.

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,950
Did she really want to

122
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,870
introduce Ding Bining to your friend

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,870
or just to catch you in her trap?

124
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,390
I have no grudge against Miss Feng.

125
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't want to assume the worst of her.

126
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,240
Your honesty doesn't mean
others aren't sneaky.

127
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,480
Just your face is enough
for her to hold a grudge.

128
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,070
You know it,

129
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,120
but you don't want to confront it.

130
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,800
You and I are just casual acquaintances.

131
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,600
Please don't guess my intentions.

132
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,190
I'm just reminding you.

133
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,190
Even trash can attract fierce dogs.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Feng Jingyun treats Qin like treasure.

135
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,510
She sees everyone as a rival.

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,070
Stay away from her.

137
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,870
Thanks for the reminder.

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,040
I helped you out back there.

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Aren't you going to thank me?

140
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,920
If it weren't for you,

141
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,680
I won't get insulted.

142
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,430
You're sharp-tongued, and won't suffer.

143
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,120
Though we didn't discuss business,

144
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,720
let's treat this as our meet-up.

145
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,720
Since business wasn't discussed,

146
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,600
we shouldn't stay too long.

147
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,920
Please finish the dishes, Mr. Jiang.

148
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,270
This restaurant belongs to me.

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,680
You two can't leave

150
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,630
without my permission.

151
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,150
If you have something to say,
just say it.

152
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,630
Shout "Qin Zhan is
a scoundrel" three times.

153
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,720
Once you're done, I'll let you go.

154
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,800
He's not even here.

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
What are you afraid of?

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
If you don't, does it mean
he isn't a scoundrel?

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,920
I never talk behind someone's back.

158
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,630
Bring him here,
and I'll say it to his face.

159
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,190
You can summon him anytime?

160
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,270
You seem to have a special connection.

161
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,240
Mr. Jiang, please be cautious.

162
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,510
Min Jiangxi is so arrogant.

163
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,510
She doesn't even respect Jiang Dong.

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,590
She's like me.

165
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,270
Mr. Jiang,

166
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,950
the issue between you
and Mr. Qin is none of my business.

167
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,190
I'm just an outsider.

168
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,120
I've never provoked you.

169
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,830
Why do you make things difficult for me?

170
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,390
Because I like you.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
Isn't that obvious?

172
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,480
No need for compliments.

173
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,070
You have such a distinct style.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,390
I like it even more.

175
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,680
Alright, I'll compromise.

176
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,950
If you drink this red wine,

177
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,070
I'll let you leave.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,950
Mr. Qin.

179
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,480
You came even without her calling.

180
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,000
I didn't underestimate Miss Min's charm.

181
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,000
Insult me to my face if you dare.

182
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,070
It's not good to force a woman.

183
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,360
If you want trouble, just say it.

184
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,910
Every day is a good day for that.

185
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,840
Just talking is pointless.

186
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,630
We've changed the rules.

187
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,320
If she drinks all of this,

188
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,470
I'll let her leave.

189
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,240
Can you really stop me

190
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,670
if I want to take someone?

191
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,470
Qin,

192
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,440
this is my turf.

193
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,240
If you're brave enough to drink for her,

194
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,870
I'll let her go and promise
not to bother her again.

195
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,270
You are the Young Master Qin.

196
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,840
Would you be afraid to
drink a bottle of red wine?

197
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,870
What, worried I poisoned it?

198
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,510
Wait a moment.

199
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,870
Let's set the rules first.

200
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,470
She can drink

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
one bottle.

202
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,480
But you have to

203
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,390
triple the amount.

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,870
I always keep my word.

205
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
Let's see your sincerity.

206
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,590
Just this?

207
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,790
Not even enough to rinse my mouth.

208
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Mr. Qin.

209
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,120
Impressive, Qin.

210
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,030
I've drunk it.

211
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,870
Be wary of deceitful people.

212
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,240
Starting tomorrow,

213
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,960
you'll move to the Qin's.

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,840
Let's see who dares to mess with us.

215
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,870
- I…
- That's settled.

216
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,600
I don't want my people

217
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,750
targeted by opportunists.

218
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,870
Who are you insulting?

219
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,990
Qin,

220
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,670
be direct next time.

221
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm not well-read.

222
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,670
Are you really just Qin's tutor?

223
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,870
Interesting.

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Zhan.

225
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,790
Miss Min, you have quite the skill

226
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,910
to make the young masters of
two prominent families in Shencheng

227
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,240
almost fight over you.

228
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,150
I should thank you for this.

229
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had
this opportunity.

230
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,230
But I might have to

231
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,080
decline your offer.

232
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,320
I have plenty of offers to make.

233
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,000
There's always tomorrow.

234
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,870
Let's wait and see.

235
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,220
Hello there.

236
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,270
Could you prepare some grapes
and milk for me?

237
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,630
Sure, ma'am. Just a moment.

238
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,470
Thank you.

239
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,270
Xi, are you okay?

240
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm fine.

241
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,870
I just think Ding Bining is too naive.

242
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,270
Indeed. She even dared to
offend Jiang Dong.

243
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,750
Oh my gosh.

244
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,720
That scene felt like chaos.

245
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,910
I almost thought we'd
end up stranded here.

246
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
It isn't just about offending
Jiang Dong.

247
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,030
It's that she doesn't realize
Feng Jingyun is using her.

248
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,630
Now you've attracted
the Shencheng Double Villains.

249
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,910
Your road ahead might be even tougher.

250
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,610
I'll just handle whatever comes my way.

251
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,600
Miss, it's ready.

252
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,440
Thanks a lot.

253
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,120
What do you need these for?

254
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,440
Mr. Qin drank

255
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
three bottles of wine for us.

256
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,000
He probably hasn't eaten.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,390
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad.

258
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,440
I prepared something to help with that.

259
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,600
You're so considerate of him.

260
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,870
Are you interested in him?

261
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,360
I didn't.

262
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,870
I'm guarding my heart.

263
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,870
You might fool others,

264
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,000
but not me, your friend of 20 years.

265
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't worry.

266
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,790
I don't have such ambitions.

267
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,790
What if he likes you?

268
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,390
He stood up for you.

269
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,840
He's high-minded.

270
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,480
I'm not his type at all.

271
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,840
I'll wait for you here.

272
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,840
Didn't you say that young director

273
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,200
is eager to find a lead actress
and make me famous?

274
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,550
You said only then

275
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,440
would Jiang Dong might change his mind.

276
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,270
Jiang Dong was close to other women

277
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,630
just to make you jealous.

278
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,870
Really?

279
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,270
But that girl is good at

280
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,270
charming men.

281
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,080
Don't underestimate her.

282
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,840
What should I do then?

283
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,790
You must stop her

284
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,320
in Shencheng.

285
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,510
I'm leaving.

286
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,670
I've kept Zhan waiting too long.

287
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,910
Think about what I said.

288
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,350
Someone's here.

289
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,120
Mr. Qin, it's me.

290
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,270
Wrong place, this is the men's room.

291
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,270
I'm here to see you.

292
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,560
Mr. Qin.

293
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,750
Mr. Qin's seeing someone new.

294
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
It's just a few bottles of wine.

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,990
What could happen?

296
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,840
Drinking on an empty stomach
feels awful anyway.

297
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,440
I brought you something to sober up.

298
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,960
I heard grapes and milk
can help with that.

299
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,840
Give it a try.

300
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,270
You want me to eat grapes
in the bathroom?

301
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,480
I only thought of solutions.

302
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,200
I didn't consider the execution.

303
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,870
Sorry about that.

304
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,200
Thanks for covering for me.

305
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,710
No problem.

306
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,910
A few drinks can help you

307
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,390
deal with Jiang Dong.

308
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,710
It's worth it.

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,630
(The rumored ruthless villain)

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,670
(is so afraid of inconveniences too.)

311
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,670
Try not to listen to gossip.

312
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,720
Are you sure eating grapes

313
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,630
can offset the effects of wine?

314
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,030
I'm not sure either.

315
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,440
But these grapes are sweet.
Give them a try.

316
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,630
My hands are dirty, feed me.

317
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,000
Isn't wine made

318
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,440
from grapes?

319
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,160
This wine isn't made from these grapes.

320
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,310
That much I'm certain of.

321
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,520
What?

322
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,000
Did you find the opposite
kind of grapes?

323
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,960
Is it this easy to make you laugh?

324
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,510
Laugh if you want to.

325
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,270
Don't make me seem like a villain.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,920
It's quite sweet.

327
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,510
Didn't you dislike dirty hands?

328
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
I saw you were tense.
So I was teasing you.

329
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,480
Oh, it needs milk to work.

330
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,110
