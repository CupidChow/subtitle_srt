1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,000
(Shencheng's Chief Villain
is wealthy beyond compare.)

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,760
(Now the Chief Villain Qin Zhan)

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,760
(is hiring a tutor
with a tenfold salary.)

4
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,600
(Today,)

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,350
(I must take him in one move)

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,790
(and strive to be
the richest woman tutor.)

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,000
Spare me!

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,470
(Truly a merciless villain.)

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,710
Hello, Mr. Qin.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,230
Shut up.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,070
Dare to play tricks in front of me?

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,590
You should've seen this coming.

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,920
Help me! Please, help me!

14
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,910
Help me!

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,200
Your mind isn't sharp.

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,590
You even ask a hostess to plead for you.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,100
The second floor of
Yunshan Pavilion is off-limits.

18
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,120
Who gave you permission to enter?

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,070
Mr. Qin, it's a pleasure to meet you.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,920
My name is Min Jiangxi, and I'm a tutor.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
As a tutor, you end up
working at Yunshan Pavilion?

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,790
Are you short of money,

23
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,790
or is this your preference?

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,230
I sent over ten letters to your family,

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,560
but they all went unanswered.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,790
So I had no choice but this.

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,000
Min Jiangxi.

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,800
Mr. Qin, please show some respect.

29
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,280
I am a tutor,

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,520
not a courtesan.

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,190
It's quite common for women to approach

32
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,400
our family as a tutor.

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,590
Your tricks

34
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,840
aren't anything new.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
Compared to marrying here, I'm more

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,870
interested in your

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,120
offer of a monthly
salary of 200 dollars.

38
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,400
You're dressed like this.

39
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,630
Instead of convincing me you can teach,

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,120
why not just be honest

41
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,280
and say that you want
to get into my bed?

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,590
My outfit today is a courtesy,

43
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,030
not my way of making a living.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,310
You may respect my dress but not me,

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,960
but please don't put a price on me.

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,560
There's no dignity that money can't buy.

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,430
Name your price,

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
I'll pay ten times.

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,310
Tempted?

50
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,380
(Pharmaceuticals Order Contract)

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Many people would use their bodies

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,000
as tickets to get close to our family.

53
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,910
If you can't bring yourself to that,

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,750
then don't take the path.

55
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,030
Mr. Qin,

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,630
I understand why you were upset.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
I know where the issue

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
is in this contract.

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,560
The pricing units for
the herbs are inconsistent,

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,560
but the total uses
the largest unit instead.

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,920
Once this contract is executed…

62
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,680
- Hello, Mr. Qin.
- Hello, Mr. Qin.

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Go on.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
Once it's executed,

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,390
it'll be a huge loss for the buyer.

66
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,040
Should I praise your keen eyes,

67
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,950
or your quick thinking?

68
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,560
That's my strength,

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,830
and why I can be a good tutor.

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Someone thinks they're clever.

71
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,390
If I don't set the rules today,

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,830
I'm afraid anyone will dare to

73
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,720
do business like this with me.

74
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,160
What do you think,

75
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
Mr. Liu?

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
Young Master,

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,950
I was being confused.

78
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,950
I won't dare to do it again.

79
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,600
Help me figure out how to deal with him.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
To slice him up

81
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,560
or make him deep-fried?

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,950
(He actually made me involved.)

83
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,830
He dares to offend you

84
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
and deserves no mercy.

85
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,190
But I have a more satisfying plan.

86
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,390
Say it.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,750
He dared to tamper with your contract,

88
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,190
which shows he values money over life.

89
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,450
Why not make him
publicly apologize in the paper,

90
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,680
and expose how he
offended the Qin family?

91
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,900
His career will be destroyed.

92
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,160
This will make him wish he were dead.

93
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,030
I'll take it.

94
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,430
I want to see this published

95
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,750
in tomorrow's Shencheng Morning News.

96
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll contact the newspaper now.

97
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,510
Thank you, Young Master and Miss Min.

98
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,350
Get out.

99
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Not bad.

100
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,870
You're clever.

101
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,160
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

102
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,600
Give me something to write with.

103
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,920
I only have

104
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,120
an eyebrow pencil.

105
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,270
Don't move.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,310
Call this number in the morning.

107
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,450
I'll send a driver to pick you up.

108
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,270
I can give you a chance.

109
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,240
But you'll have to depend on yourself

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,950
to handle the kid.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
It's a deal.

112
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,360
- Take care, Mr. Qin.
- Take care, Mr. Qin.

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,540
(Shencheng Morning News Apology Notice)

114
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,940
(Shencheng)

115
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,510
Good morning, Mr. Qin.
I'm here for class.

116
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,710
Mr. Chang.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,600
Take Miss Min to Jiading's room.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
Yes.

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Miss Min, this way please.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,120
Timer starts now.

121
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,350
Miss Min,

122
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,680
at the end is his room.

123
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,670
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

124
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,270
Mr. Chang?

125
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,150
Qin Jiading.

126
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
You almost scared me!

127
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,120
You tried to scare me first.

128
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
I'm just joking with you.

129
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,150
Don't mind, please have a seat.

130
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,750
Qin, I didn't expect you
to be so thoughtful

131
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
to prepare the surprise for me.

132
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,670
I really like it.

133
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,550
Are you a woman?

134
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
I've heard about you

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,870
chasing away dozens of tutors.

136
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,870
Don't waste your time.

137
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
I wish it were real.

138
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Then we could cook it.

139
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,630
The structure isn't well made.

140
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,270
The maker probably
hasn't seen a real one.

141
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,880
That's it?

142
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,070
You're too overconfident.

143
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,020
You still came, knowing about my story.

144
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,240
No risk, no reward.

145
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,540
You value money over safety.

146
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,190
Fortune favors the bold.

147
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,030
Don't throw it.

148
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,520
How could you deal with
the next tutor if it's broken?

149
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,550
Would you give someone
a chance to replace you?

150
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,630
Of course not.

151
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,080
Then why should I waste time?

152
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,920
Come on, show your skills.

153
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,470
Qin,

154
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,060
can you satisfy my curiosity?

155
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,550
Why waste my family's money

156
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,870
just to satisfy your curiosity?

157
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,840
This time it's free of charge.

158
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,510
Ask away.

159
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,720
Based on my 20 years of experience,

160
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
I can tell you're not
a real troublemaker.

161
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,000
Why did you chase all the tutors away?

162
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
In the eyes of those stubborn tutors,

163
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm just lucky to
be born in this family.

164
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,630
I'm just an unwelcomed

165
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,390
little kid if thrown outside.

166
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,790
But doesn't everyone grow up
from being a little kid?

167
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,630
Were they born

168
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,720
big kids?

169
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,000
You're irreverent.

170
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,200
But

171
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,630
I like it.

172
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,030
You must have noticed,

173
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,270
Mr. Qin is determined
to find you a tutor.

174
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,510
I came here to make money.

175
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,910
Let's not make things difficult.

176
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,000
You seek peace, I seek profit.

177
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
How does that sound?

178
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,200
It depends on your actions.

179
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,150
So, we're on the same side now.

180
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,270
Don't think about

181
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,870
making troubles for me anymore.

182
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm not.

183
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,750
Yes, you are.

184
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,550
At least you were.

185
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,670
Class time.

186
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,420
(Chinese)

187
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,750
(She's amazing.)

188
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,240
What was that look from Mr. Chang?

189
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,840
You're the first tutor
I haven't expelled,

190
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
and who finished the whole lesson.

191
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,080
Mr. Chang is just surprised.

192
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Does this mean I've
won the first battle?

193
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,670
I need to see

194
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,000
if you just intend to teach me.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,840
After all,

196
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,510
many women use the tutor excuse

197
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,840
to get close to him.

198
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,440
None of them are easy to deal with.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
Your description is...

200
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,920
Zhan.

201
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,440
The most difficult one is here.

202
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,360
I heard you got into a fight.

203
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,550
Are you hurt anywhere?

204
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,630
Let me take a look.

205
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
(Is this his rumored stepmother?)

206
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,700
