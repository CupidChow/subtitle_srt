9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,400
Dad.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,640
I will only marry Zhan.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,880
Zhan never submits to others.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,640
You're planning to marry him now.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,070
Is it sympathy more than love?

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,840
Zhan wouldn't agree either.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Right?

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,640
It's not sympathy.

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm struggling myself.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,430
I never meant to involve you.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,510
Zhan understands it.

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,280
It's all because of that troublemaker

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,840
who won over Jiang Dong
and suppressed Zhan.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,070
Since Zhan is capable of

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,840
making his business top in Shencheng,

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
he can rise again.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,310
I won't suffer

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,480
if I marry him.

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,510
(Qin Zhan surely
has the skill to rise again.)

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,760
(It's best not to fall out with him.)

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,190
Take a seat.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,870
You claim to be my daughter.

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,430
But your mind is full of romance.

32
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,230
Marriage can wait.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,920
Helping Zhan regain his status

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,760
is the top priority.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,280
Uncle, will you lend a hand?

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,870
For the sake of our old ties,

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,190
I won't stand by.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
But

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,350
I have one condition.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,430
I can lend you some funds for now,

41
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,560
interest-free.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Once the pharmacy runs again,

43
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,680
I want a 50% share annually.

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
50%?

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,910
Dad, that's too much.

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,750
Look at the whole city,

47
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,240
who else can help him but me?

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,630
Besides,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,910
if you get along,

50
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,630
we'll be a family

51
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,120
in the future.

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,280
Business ties run deep.

53
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,710
I can't promise lightly.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
I'll consider this proposal.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,470
Until you've decided,

56
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,080
everything is off the table.

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,280
Uncle, I'll take my leave.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Dad,

59
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,280
you've always known I admire Zhan.

60
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,310
Now we can finally be together.

61
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,080
Why are you giving him a hard time?

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,520
Jiang Dong has been
under Qin Zhan's control for years.

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,470
Now, a mere young woman

64
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,400
has turned the tide.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
There must be a trick about this.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,470
You don't know how clever she is.

67
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,470
Zhan's Pharmacy has been ruined.

68
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,080
What trick could he have?

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,280
He acts arrogantly.

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Now he's defeated
and trying to make peace.

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,030
Who knows what he's planning.

72
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,840
Stop preaching to me.

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,910
You just want me to marry

74
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,280
into a wealthy family.

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,870
You don't care about my feelings.

76
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Mindless fool.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,870
Mr. Jiang, why do you come

78
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,120
in person?

79
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,910
We're here to settle a score.

80
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,270
But it's Feng Yuanzhang who must pay.

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,630
Hongmen only sells banned drugs.

82
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,070
We don't take murder or robbery jobs.

83
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
No murder?

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,750
Do you remember
the Min Family at Yecheng?

85
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,000
Who are you talking about?

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
I don't know them.

87
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
But

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
if you're willing to be my wife,

89
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,430
I might consider it

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,870
and help you out.

91
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,120
She survived the fire two years ago.

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,360
We know you're the arsonist

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,800
and the person behind you

94
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,480
is Feng Yuanzhang.

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,310
I don't know any Feng Yuanzhang.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,310
Don't accuse me without proof.

97
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,560
You should check

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,720
whose land you're on first.

99
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,270
It's probably not Lin's land,

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,830
but Feng's.

101
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,480
(The deed)
Feng Yuanzhang helped you out

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,870
not out of kindness,

103
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,360
but because he planned it.

104
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,630
This deed is the proof.

105
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,680
- Your turn.
- Don't.

106
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,870
Why is my luck so bad?

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,310
What kind of game is this?

108
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,710
I won.

109
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,830
Everyone, leave, get out.

110
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,030
Go away.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Dr. Lin,

112
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,360
the two-week deadline is up.

113
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,480
When will you repay
the money you owe me?

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,360
Mr. Cheng, please show some mercy.

115
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm having a bad day today.

116
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,310
If luck was on my side,
I'd win some back.

117
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,310
Can you give me a break?

118
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm not a saint.

119
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,790
Get him.

120
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,310
It hurts!

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,480
Please spare me.

122
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,630
How much does he owe you?

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Is it worth using weapons?

124
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,430
Director Feng, sorry
for the disturbance.

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,310
I'll take him out.

126
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,240
Let's go.

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Wait.

128
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,950
I'll pay

129
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,870
his debt.

130
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,830
The original location on the deed

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,310
was the casino where you were hurt.

132
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,510
And the real owner of that Casino

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
was Feng Yuanzhang.

134
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,870
Feng Yuanzhang managed
the Maritime Fortress

135
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,240
while secretly running the casino.

136
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,390
When investigation started,

137
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,750
he cut his losses to survive,

138
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
selling the casino to the Jiang Family

139
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
who were expanding their pharmacy.

140
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,120
It's hard to stop once greed takes root.

141
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,510
Feng Yuanzhang had wanted

142
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,920
to push a secretive business
beyond the casino.

143
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,360
But he lacked someone who was

144
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,170
(Seller: Feng Yuanzhang, Buyer: Jiang Cenfeng)
skilled in pharmacology with greed.

145
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,720
You became his target.

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,070
He thrived

147
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,870
by draining you.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,360
But you're trapped in the shadows

149
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
and struggle to survive.

150
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,180
You only even get a small cut of profit.

151
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,680
Don't you hate it?

152
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
That's enough!

153
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,430
Feng Yuanzhang.

154
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,310
You've played a big game.

155
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,430
Then don't blame me

156
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,430
for changing Hongmen's name.

157
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,320
Tell me.

158
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,950
What do you want me to do?

159
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
(Land deed)

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
Qian, deliver all the goods
in the pharmacy

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,720
to the warehouse.

162
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,870
Okay, I'm on it.

163
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Mr. Qin.

164
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,760
Uncle.

165
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,150
What are you doing here?

166
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,480
Where did you hide Jingyun?

167
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,480
I haven't seen Jingyun

168
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
since I last visited you.

169
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,190
But after Jingyun got angry

170
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,680
and stormed out that day,

171
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,950
she never came home again.

172
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,340
Hello?

173
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,950
Send someone to find Miss Feng now.

174
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,830
Stop pretending.

175
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,830
I declined your revival of the pharmacy.

176
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,360
You must hold a grudge

177
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
and detain Jingyun

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,870
when she came to see you

179
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,870
use her for leverage.

180
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,310
Our family's business relies on shipping

181
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
and your support.

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,870
I'd never do something like that.

183
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,160
It'd damage our relationship.

184
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,310
You better be as sensible as you claim.

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,870
Leave it to me.

186
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,360
Wait for the news.

187
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,040
Young Master, Miss Feng is in trouble.

188
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,720
Jingyun?

189
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,800
What's going on?

190
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,480
We found Miss Feng when delivering goods

191
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,550
to the warehouse.

192
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,630
What warehouse?

193
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,120
We'll get to those details later.

194
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,510
- Get the doctor.
- Yes.

195
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,710
- Let's go.
- Okay.

196
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,800
Dad.

197
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
A dog is trying to bite me.

198
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,360
Wild dogs will eat me.

199
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Dad, a wild dog is going to eat me.

200
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Stay back.

201
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,540
Dad.

202
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,840
Miss Feng, calm down.

203
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,720
Zhan, help me.

204
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,960
Zhan, save me.

205
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,200
Help me, Zhan.

206
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
What's going on?

207
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,870
When we were unloading…

208
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,410
Miss Feng.

209
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Miss Feng.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,630
Miss Feng was disoriented.

211
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,510
She kept mumbling something, like

212
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,870
"wild dogs, don't bite me",

213
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,270
and "Qin Zhan, save me".

214
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
It seems she's suffered

215
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,910
quite a bit these days.

216
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,230
Uncle,

217
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,510
that's fishy.

218
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,000
Even now, you dare to argue.

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
My men recognized that was Jiang's car.

220
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,670
How is Jingyun?

221
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,440
Miss Feng is terrified

222
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,960
and now she's mentally distressed.

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
And

224
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,240
Miss Feng has more than just injuries.

225
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,360
She's been violated.

226
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,960
I'll check on Jingyun.

227
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,840
Mr. Feng.

228
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,750
This

229
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,870
must remain confidential.

230
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,440
Zhan, save me.

231
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,200
Zhan, help me.

232
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,030
Zhan.

233
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,870
Zhan, save me.

234
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,560
Zhan.

235
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Qin Zhan.

236
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,270
You dared to conspire with Jiang Dong

237
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,630
to hurt my daughter.

238
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,150
You have a clever plan.

239
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,150
It must be Jiang Dong.

240
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,670
He must be afraid of me

241
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,320
being supported by you

242
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,480
and sow discord,

243
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,320
trying to block my final path.

244
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
(Jingyun's reputation is lost.)

245
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,670
(I must try to make her)

246
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,120
(gain more for the Feng Family.)

247
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,840
Such despicable methods

248
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,630
resemble Jiang Dong's style.

249
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,670
Your feud continues.

250
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,150
But don't use my daughter as a pawn.

251
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,120
Jingyun is in this state now.

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,270
What do you plan to do?

253
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,120
This happened because of me.

254
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,650
I'll take responsibility.

255
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,720
I've chosen a match for Jingyun,

256
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,870
and our close friends know about it.

257
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,120
But now, with Jingyun like this,

258
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,480
this marriage is impossible.

259
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,360
Won't I become a laughingstock?

260
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,630
I suppose you already have a plan.

261
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,120
Feel free to speak.

262
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,510
Our reputation must be upheld.

263
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,320
This engagement banquet must be held.

264
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,910
You will marry Jingyun.

265
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Me?

266
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
Zhan,

267
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,960
you've always been sensible.

268
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,080
Don't worry.

269
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,030
I will help

270
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,150
the man my daughter marries.

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,550
This started because of me.

272
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,840
But Uncle, I...

273
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,120
It's settled then.

274
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,080
I heard the Jiang Family's
adopted daughter

275
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,870
has a complicated relationship with you.

276
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,270
And now this has happened,

277
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,510
how do you plan to handle it?

278
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,840
Those who harmed the Qin Family

279
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
must face consequences.

280
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
There's no time to waste.

281
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,480
It's an auspicious day in three days.

282
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,120
With Jingyun in this state,

283
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,900
the engagement banquet
shouldn't be grand.

284
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,150
Handle it as you see fit.

285
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Don't worry, Uncle. I'll take care of it.

286
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,320
(If the Jiang Family
dares harm my daughter,)

287
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,510
(I'll make sure their
daughter pays too.)

288
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,700
