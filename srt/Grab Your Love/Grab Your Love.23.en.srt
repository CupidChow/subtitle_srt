Who are you?

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,920
Why did you bring me here?

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,840
Sir has given an order,

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,640
after the Miss Feng and Mr. Qin's
engagement banquet,

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,000
your body will be laid at Qin's gate

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,960
as a warning to others

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,920
not to cling to Mr. Qin.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,760
Bro,

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,590
it's such a waste for this beauty

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,430
to die.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,640
Why not let us have some fun?

20
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,870
Let go of me!

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,590
You woman.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm going to make you mine now.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,310
Don't complicate things.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,510
Congratulations.

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,640
Thank you.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,680
Congratulations.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,120
- Congratulations, Director Feng.
- President Sun, thank you!

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
I wasn't invited for such a big event.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,480
Mr. Qin had to send me an invitation.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,310
You'll have to have
a penalty toast later.

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,920
I'll punish myself with drinks.

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,600
- Alright.
- Young Master.

33
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,310
Miss Min is in trouble.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,400
Thank you.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
- Someone saw Miss Min being taken.
- Please, please.

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,200
Chief Chen, welcome.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
Welcome.

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Congratulations.

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,430
Qin Zhan is cunning.

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,870
He secretly invited
all Shencheng's officials

41
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,080
to prove that our family supports him.

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,560
Zhan.

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,430
Zhan,

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,150
marry me.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,710
Why isn't Qin Zhan back yet?

46
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
Mr. Qin said

47
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,080
he's preparing a big gift
for you and Miss.

48
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Alright.

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,870
There's no wolf that can't bow its head.

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,310
Young Master, why are you outside?

51
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,310
The banquet is over.

52
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,700
Take me to the warehouse where
Feng Yuanzhang hid the drugs.

53
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,710
W-What warehouse?

54
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,680
I've had enough of this.

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,710
If you don't end this now,

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,710
I'll make sure you and Feng
are buried together.

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,750
Young Master.

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,030
Young Master, please listen to me.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,640
Young Master.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,080
I'll take you there.

61
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,520
Please, spare me.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,560
How I deal with you is my business.

63
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,470
Drive.

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,630
Yes, yes.

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Mr. Qin.

66
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,240
Restricted area. Keep out.

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,920
Step aside.

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
There's someone I want inside.

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Don't be nervous.

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,030
This is my father-in-law's test for me.

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,150
Let me handle her myself.

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,520
Mr. Feng said it.

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,310
Who is it?

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Don't touch me.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,640
It's me.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Mr. Qin.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,920
What are you doing?

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,510
Do I need to explain?

79
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,710
Mr. Qin.

80
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,680
Hurry up or it's too late

81
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
and you'll miss the right time.

82
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,040
It's about to start.

83
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Mr. Qin,

84
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,950
don't blame us for outnumbering you.

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,070
It does seem a bit unfair.

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,520
Go.

87
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,160
- Take them all away.
- Yes.

88
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
I can't believe Jiang Dong

89
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,270
couldn't even protect you.

90
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
Wait a moment.

91
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,750
We can't keep these illegal drugs.

92
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,560
If they hit the market,
people will suffer.

93
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,980
(Hongmen Special Drugs)

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,430
The real show is just starting.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,950
I'll take you to see it.

96
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,260
(Hongmen Special Drugs)

97
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,390
- Chief Chen, sorry for the oversight
- Congrats.

98
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,070
Please come inside.

99
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,070
Sorry for the oversight. Please.

100
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,190
The right time has passed.

101
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,630
The fiancé still hasn't shown up.

102
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,920
Did he run away from the wedding?

103
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,560
Isn't Mr. Qin close

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,630
with that woman?

105
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
The Qin Family fell

106
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,920
and then he became
Mr. Feng's son-in-law.

107
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
- This is men.
- Where's Qin Zhan?

108
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,600
Why isn't he back?

109
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,230
Zhan.

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
Why isn't Zhan here?

111
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,310
Does he not love me anymore?

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Sir.

113
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,240
What gift did Mr. Qin
prepare for Jingyun?

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,270
It's so mysterious.

115
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,390
Bring it up.

116
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,480
The gift is too big.

117
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,200
Please move to the side room.

118
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,390
Everyone.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,670
Please have a seat.

120
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,480
I'll be right back with Jingyun.

121
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,010
Alright.

122
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,790
How much longer?

123
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
Almost there.

124
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,630
Okay.

125
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
Dad, where are we?

126
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,750
I'm scared.

127
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,630
It's okay. We're nearly there.

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,670
Isn't that my painting?

129
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,000
Qin Zhan, what do you mean?

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,910
Zhan.

131
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,480
Jiang Dong.

132
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,270
Why are you here?

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,630
I'm here to bring a gift.

134
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,480
Zhan.

135
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
Zhan.

136
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Zhan.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
Zhan.

138
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,390
Zhan.

139
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Where did you hide Zhan?

140
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
Give Zhan back to me.

141
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,750
Min Jiangxi.

142
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,840
Where did you hide Zhan?

143
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
Get out of my way!

144
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Jingyun.

145
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,630
You're not worthy of
mentioning Min Jiangxi.

146
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,790
Jiang Dong.

147
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,600
How dare you touch my daughter!

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why are you here?

149
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,790
Qin Zhan went to the warehouse.

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,720
What did you say?

151
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,320
Don't come closer!

152
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,270
The warehouse is so hidden.

153
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,000
How did Qin Zhan find it out?

154
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,270
Because I told him

155
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,320
his girlfriend was kept there by you.

156
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,720
I saved your life

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,480
and you dare betray me?

158
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,350
Feng Yuanzhang.

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,840
You plotted to drag me down.

160
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,000
You should've expected exposure.

161
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,790
I'm using Qin Zhan to get rid of you.

162
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,510
This is my payback to you.

163
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,590
You!

164
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,230
By the way,

165
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
you might not know yet.

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Don't come closer.

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,030
I tore off her clothes

168
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,550
with this injured hand.

169
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,870
(So it was this jerk who did it.)

170
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,750
The taste of a benefactor's
daughter is sweet.

171
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
Stop talking! Just be quiet!

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,790
It's you!

173
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,960
Feng Yuanzhang.

174
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,670
You ordered Lin Guangyao to set the fire

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,750
and caused the Min Family's downfall.

176
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,630
If you don't confess today,

177
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,240
I'll make you regret it.

178
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm the Maritime Bureau Director.

179
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,750
Would I kill for a painting?

180
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,630
Ridiculous.

181
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,150
This painting is an
heirloom of my family.

182
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,840
That guy always made me do dirty work,

183
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,480
so I kept something in reserve,

184
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,240
just in case things go south

185
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,790
and I have to take the blame.

186
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,790
It looks like it's finally useful now.

187
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
(Min Huai)

188
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,740
(Min Huai)

189
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,000
Director Feng,

190
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,630
