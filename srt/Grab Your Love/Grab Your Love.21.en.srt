Qian.

10
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,040
Miss Min.

11
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,510
Where's Mr. Qin?

12
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,000
Mr. Qin is in the study.

13
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,800
The workers at the factory
are on strike.

14
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,150
I'm here to bring some documents.

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,760
Why are they striking?

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,120
It's because the Jiang family

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,120
poached all the pharmacists from ours.

18
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,350
Zhan,

19
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,920
what happened?

20
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,990
Min Jiangxi,

21
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,150
when did you start plotting against me?

22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,480
Since the day you entered
Yunshan Pavilion,

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
or when you moved in?

24
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't understand what you're saying.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,800
Yesterday, you and your brother
acted like family to me.

26
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,190
Today, you set me up.

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,680
This plan of yours is

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
quite clever.

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,750
If you're tired of me, just let me go.

30
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,080
No need to accuse me of

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,590
- baseless crimes.
- Baseless crimes?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,910
Isn't this your correspondence
with Jiang Dong?

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,190
It details

34
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,630
the Qin Family Pharmacists' salaries

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,650
and confidential formulas.

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,460
(Xi: For Your Eyes Only.
Dong: For Your Eyes Only)

37
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,280
Now we've lost not only
pharmacists and formulas,

38
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,800
but even the rare medicinal herbs

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,350
stored at the docks have been destroyed.

40
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,080
You treacherous woman!

41
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,120
You're heartless.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,710
You've treated me well.

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,710
I would never betray you.

44
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,840
Someone must be framing me.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
Enough!

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,190
Every time, it's someone framing you.

47
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,870
Who are you blaming this time?

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,190
Ding Bining or Feng Jingyun?

49
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,310
Mr. Chang.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
I didn't do it.

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Why won't you believe me?

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,120
Pack Min Jiangxi's bags now

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,310
and make her leave my house.

54
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,190
Why are you so harsh to Miss Min?

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,520
What's wrong with you two?

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,120
Do you want to leave with her too?

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,470
Jiading, time to study.

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,190
Miss Min, you can't leave.

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,190
Miss Min.

60
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,560
He's going to marry that woman.

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
Why are you here again?

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Miss Feng,

63
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,710
I bring you good news.

64
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,800
Only her downfall is good news to me.

65
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,920
She's in a

66
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,120
miserable state now.

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,720
I thought she was just a sly cat.

68
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
It turns out

69
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,510
she was pretending to be naive.

70
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,870
What brings you here?

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,720
Your family's situation is serious.

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,870
I'm worried about you.

73
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,560
You're here to mock me too.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,720
Zhan, I warned you

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
that she was calculating.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,390
If you had listened to me,

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
you wouldn't be here today.

78
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,040
What's the point of

79
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,120
saying this now?

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,830
I've lost everything.

81
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,160
I can't get back up anymore.

82
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,390
Are you giving up?

83
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,600
What else can I do?

84
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,600
My father wants to
transfer me away from Shencheng.

85
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,160
I have to hand the business
I've worked hard for

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,480
all over to my big brother.

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Zhan,

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm here.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,680
I'll help you start anew.

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,390
I hurt you deeply back then.

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,120
It's already a favor not to
make it worse for me.

92
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,480
I don't take advantage of women.

93
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,480
You should leave.

94
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,920
In Shencheng,

95
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,630
there's no trouble

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,680
my father can't solve.

97
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,560
The man I care about is struggling.

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,190
He surely won't ignore it.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Besides,

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,850
our families have been
allies for generations.

101
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,480
What are you worried about?

102
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,160
I've invested everything in the pharmacy.

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,510
I can't recover from this.

104
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,480
Are you afraid

105
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,600
that I'll suffer with you?

106
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,850
There is an ancient painting
in my family.

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
It will be given as dowry

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,680
on my wedding day.

109
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,680
We'll convert it to cash

110
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,390
and exchange it for

111
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,720
medicine and doctors.

112
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,160
There's no priceless
ancient painting in the world.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,870
That's my dowry.

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,800
If you want to see it,

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,870
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,950
It turns out

117
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,160
the one by your side

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
can only be me.

119
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,480
Young Master, watch out.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,430
Young Master, come here.

121
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,670
Sit.

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,510
How did you get this drunk?

123
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,750
Leave it to me. You can go back now.

124
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
Alright.

125
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,750
Young Master, have some water.

126
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,160
Mr. Chang.

127
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,310
Throw this outfit away.

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
Yes.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,870
You didn't greet me.

130
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,390
Where are your manners?

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,120
You've chased Miss Min away.

132
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,200
No one taught me about manners.

133
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,650
(Just wait a little longer.)

134
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,550
Shencheng's eligible bachelors' details

135
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,510
are all here.

136
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,550
Jingyun,

137
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,750
what are you holding?

138
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,670
It's the new movie poster I shot.

139
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,550
I want to show it to Zhan.

140
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,670
Go ahead.

141
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Now that Qin Zhan has fallen,

142
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,510
he's no longer of use to me.

143
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,030
I need to find someone

144
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
to help Jingyun regain her focus.

145
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
Zhan,

146
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,870
I brought the famous painting with me.

147
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,870
My dad said this painting
is centuries old.

148
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,510
It went through dozens of processes from

149
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,270
material selection to
coloring and texture.

150
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,870
Even the scroll itself is

151
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,390
crafted by master artisans.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,360
I said it could solve your problem.

153
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,870
Wasn't I right?

154
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
Mr. Chang.

155
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,670
Min Jiangxi?

156
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,360
You ungrateful person.

157
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,790
How dare you come here?

158
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm here for my wages.

159
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,480
You joined the Jiang Family.

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
And you still care about this salary?

161
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,600
Did you get kicked out

162
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,600
after being used by Jiang Dong

163
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,550
just like Ding Bining?

164
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,270
Even if the pay is low,

165
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,670
it's still what I deserve.

166
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,790
Has the Qin family fallen so low

167
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,480
that they can't afford this?

168
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,670
Do we need an outsider

169
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,550
to make sarcastic comments here?

170
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,910
Zhan and I are getting engaged.

171
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,870
From now on,

172
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,870
I am the lady of the Qin Family.

173
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,630
By the way,

174
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
can you help me decide where the dowry

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,510
should be displayed?

176
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,720
I just left

177
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,910
and you rushed to offer yourself.

178
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,630
You are really eager.

179
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,750
I kindly asked you to see this painting.

180
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,870
It's such a precious item after all.

181
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,960
Someone who dares
to betray their employer

182
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,600
for a tiny profit

183
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,080
won't see this in their lifetime.

184
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,960
I'd like to see

185
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,120
how grand the Feng Family can be

186
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,790
to earn praise from Shencheng's top.

187
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,120
This rare famous painting is Xi's dowry.

188
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
It's a masterpiece.

189
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,510
Mr. Qin is fortunate.

190
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Of course.

191
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,120
Compared to you,

192
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,000
a wealthy and

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
refined lady like me

194
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,790
is the perfect match for Zhan.

195
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,840
Please enjoy.

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,790
I won't disturb you.

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,040
Mr. Chang.

198
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,350
Uncle,

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
with the year-end approaching,

200
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,080
I brought some supplements for you.

201
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,720
Hope Uncle accepts this gift.

202
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,080
- Zhan.
- In past festivals,

203
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,720
you sent gifts but didn't come.

204
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,320
Now, with your family in trouble,

205
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,670
you still make such a grand gesture.

206
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
You're truly thoughtful.

207
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,510
I've been busy with business.

208
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,390
I hope Uncle won't mind.

209
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,790
Our families have been
allies for generations

210
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,670
and went to the top
in Shencheng together.

211
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,710
Young people

212
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,120
should always remember their roots.

213
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,110
Dad,

214
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,050
since our families are so connected,

215
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,840
why not

216
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,360
have Zhan and I get closer?

217
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,470
What do you think?

218
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
Great idea.

219
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,750
The Feng Family lacks a male heir.

220
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,480
Adopting a godson

221
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,960
isn't a bad idea.

222
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,510
What godson?

223
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,870
I want to marry Zhan.

224
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,900
Choosing a husband is
choosing our family's future.

225
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,360
This isn't for you to decide alone.

226
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Dad,

227
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,670
I will marry no one but Zhan.

228
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,500
