Explain this.

It's not her fault.

15

Do you have a first aid kit?

Don't move.

21

I can do it myself.

I told you not to move.

Luckily, the injury isn't deep.

24

I met him once

at Miss Feng's party.

26
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,400

I didn't expect

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,150
he'd come to my home

29
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,910
and hurt Jiading.

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,870
I'm sorry about it.

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,190
made Jiading involved.

Mr. Qin

isn't your dad, but your uncle?

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,950
It's just my mistake.

85
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,600
I thought you were

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,760
young and accomplished.

87
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,430
Is that how the word

88
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,120
is used?

89
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,150
Of course not.

90
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,110
Alright.

91
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,800

(Rumors can really harm.)

95
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,390
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,240
Thank you.

100
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,830
You've thanked him
several times tonight.

101
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,270
You just said sorry to me.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,680
It seems

103
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
I saved you two.

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,750
I overlooked it.

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,390
Thank you for your help.

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
No worries.

107
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,430
Anyway, your fruit porridge

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,830
kind of saved him too.

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,270
So we're even now.

110
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,040
(Looks like I can
keep this job for now.)

111
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
Mr. Qin,

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,510
there's something I want to say.

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,400
Go ahead.

114
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,070
We shouldn't only focus on grades

115
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,480
when educating.

116
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,920
A child's character

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
should also be emphasized.

118
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
As a tutor,

119
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,560
what I can teach Jiading is limited.

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,120
Family plays a key role

121
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,390
in a child's growth.

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,230
Get to the point.

123
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,390
Your actions

124
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
will be a model for Jiading.

125
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,600
You nearly killed Zhou Yang with glass.

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,950
That guy deserved it.

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
If it were me,

128
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,900
I'd have cut it.

129
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Stop it.

130
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,480
Are you worried I'll mislead him?

131
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,910
Yes.

132
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,480
I hired you

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
to teach Qin Jiading,

134
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,830
not to teach me life lessons.

135
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,430
Sorry, I overstepped.

136
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,160
But I agree with your suggestion.

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,070
I'll be careful.

138
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Also,

139
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,270
I'll investigate Zhou Yang.

140
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,870
It doesn't concern Mr. Qin.

141
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,830
Just focus on teaching Jiading.

142
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,800
Don't worry about anything else.

143
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,190
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

144
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Go upstairs.

145
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
Lock the door.

146
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
Let me go!

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,550
- Let go of me!
- Move.

148
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,120
Who are you?

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
Who dares to

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,360
kidnap me?

151
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,480
Mr. Qin.

152
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,960
Why did you bring me here?

153
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Mr. Qin.

154
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
You harassed Miss Min.

155
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,550
Was it under Feng Jingyun's orders?

156
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,510
(Miss Feng?)

157
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,790
No, it was my decision.

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,630
It has nothing to do with my cousin.

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,440
Cousin?

160
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
How brave.

161
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,200
Since he's taking the blame,

162
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,000
you choose his fate.

163
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,600
Mr. Qin, Miss Min,

164
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm begging you.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,390
It's my fault for being blind.

166
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
I aimed too high.

167
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,390
Please forgive me.

168
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,630
Just this once, spare me.

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,960
Being soft on the wicked

170
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,080
only encourages more evil.

171
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
Are you kneeling for survival

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,550
or for your mistake?

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,030
Miss Min, I know I was wrong.

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,670
I... I drank too much that day.

175
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
And I didn't do anything to you.

176
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't deserve to die.

177
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,110
I promise

178
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,320
I'll stay far away from you.

179
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,480
I'll never show up again.

180
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,390
Please forgive me.

181
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,690
You can't tell right from wrong,
but you value your life.

182
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,360
Now you know how to beg for mercy.

183
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,200
But when you did that to us,

184
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,670
I didn't see you showing any mercy.

185
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,550
It seems like you won't

186
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,630
get away with this.

187
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,600
Mr. Qin. You and my cousin
grew up together.

188
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,960
We can be a family.

189
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,630
I'll be your brother-in-law.

190
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,670
You can't kill me.

191
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,840
I don't need you to arrange my marriage.

192
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,840
Tell the person behind you,

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,320
if they dare to touch my people,

194
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
they'll suffer something

195
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,510
worse than death.

196
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,630
Finish it.

197
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
I've finished it.

198
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,790
Can I leave now?

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,870
Leave?

200
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
I haven't even started yet.

201
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,320
What do you mean?

202
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,110
Get up.

203
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,120
What are you doing?

204
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,550
I'm kindly letting you drink more,

205
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,590
so that

206
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,910
you won't feel the pain.

207
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,030
What are you doing?

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,630
Helping you break free.

209
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
No!

210
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,920
How is it?

211
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,870
I didn't do it in front of Jiading.

212
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,360
Not a bad influence, right?

213
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,990
No.

214
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Glad to hear that.

215
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,270
Cousin, you can't leave me.

216
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,720
I'm my dad's only son.

217
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,960
Now

218
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,960
our Family might end with me.

219
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,000
You loser.

220
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,840
Can't even get a girl.

221
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,650
How can your dad expect you to
continue the family line?

222
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,200
Qin Zhan beat me up

223
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,750
and I didn't rat you out.

224
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,840
If you leave me to die,

225
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
don't blame me for talking.

226
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,360
I paid your gambling debts

227
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,360
at Hongmen.

228
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,150
And you dare threaten me?

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,600
I didn't mean it like that.

230
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,350
Heal up.

231
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,670
Get out of Shencheng.

232
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,240
Don't stay here causing trouble.

233
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,440
Women can be so cruel.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,360
You'll get your karma.

235
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,080
Mr. Qin,

236
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,320
today's class is over.

237
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
I'll head back now.

238
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you.

239
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,600
Miss Min, you made it just in time.

240
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,870
Please don't leave.

241
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,600
Sit. I'll drive you home.

242
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,870
I heard my cousin almost hurt you.

243
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,550
I was worried.

244
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,960
He's been straightforward.

245
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,440
He doesn't know how to court a girl

246
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,390
and caused this.

247
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,080
You might

248
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,360
misunderstand "court".

249
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,480
Forcing isn't courting.

250
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Miss Min, don't be too harsh.

251
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,870
The Zhou Family's lineage has ended.

252
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,840
Isn't that enough to calm you?

253
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,480
It's not Min Jiangxi who ended it.

254
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,910
It's those who encouraged
his actions in Shencheng.

255
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,150
Zhan,

256
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,200
Zhou Yang is my cousin.

257
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,440
But I came here today

258
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,080
because I have a clear conscience.

259
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,200
Since it isn't related to you,

260
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,630
don't ask her to be forgiving.

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,030
Miss Min,

262
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,960
though I wasn't close to
Zhou Yang since childhood,

263
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,600
as his cousin,

264
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,480
I ought to apologize.

265
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
Each grievance has its source.

266
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,630
Since it's not your fault,

267
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
I shouldn't accept these.

268
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,550
You still won't forgive me.

269
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,630
This is in the past.

270
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,960
I won't keep pushing.

271
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,030
That's a relief.

272
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,870
By the way,

273
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,600
I heard your friend is
looking for a lead actress.

274
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,480
Do you have someone to recommend?

275
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,350
Smart guess.

276
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
My good friend, Ding Bining.

277
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,720
I can introduce her to you.

278
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
(She knows how to lower herself)

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,840
(to please him.)

280
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Thanks for helping my friend, Miss Feng.

281
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,030
Zhan,

282
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,840
Miss Min isn't upset.

283
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,840
So don't stay upset, alright?

284
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
See you tomorrow then.

285
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,480
(Zhan's so protective of her.)

286
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,600
(it seems I have to deal
with Min Jiangxi.)

287
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,270
I know the truth.

288
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,240
But our families can't fall out yet.

289
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
So you'll have to endure for now.

290
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,240
Seeing how Zhou Yang is now,

291
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,000
it'd be unreasonable of me

292
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,750
if I still feel sad.

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,030
It'd let you down.

294
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,830
It started because of me.

295
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,590
I'll make it up to you.

296
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,680
Are you giving me a raise?

297
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,350
You're just focused on money.

298
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,680
I teach on the edge.

299
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't I deserve a raise?

300
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
Are you worried I'll be taken away?

301
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,240
You don't have to come.

302
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,590
Didn't you say the director

303
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,070
would bring Qin's tutor?

304
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm curious about

305
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
his new taste.

306
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,350
Women around Qin Zhan are countless.

307
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,440
You're curious about every one of them.

308
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,750
Aren't you tired?

309
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,510
You were with Qin for so long.

310
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,480
Have you ever seen him
get angry for anyone?

311
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,200
Darn it.

312
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,240
Why is Jiang Dong here?

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who is Jiang Dong?

314
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,830
He's that pretty boy inside.

315
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,560
I say.

316
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,640
He's the man only second
to Qin in Shencheng

317
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,160
and has always seen
Qin as his top rival.

318
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,480
But of course,

319
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,240
Qin never takes him seriously.

320
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,270
Why did he come here?

321
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,590
It's over.

322
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,310
Anything Qin desires,

323
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,640
he always meddles,

324
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,790
especially with

325
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,960
women.

326
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,880
Feng Jingyun

327
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
has bad intentions.

328
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,400
He's not here with good intentions.

329
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,590
Play it by ear.

330
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,590
Sorry, we're late.

331
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,270
No, we're early.

332
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,720
Miss Min, nice to meet you.

333
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,240
I'm Jiang Dong.
