9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,960
Besides tutoring Jiading,

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,500
Miss Min hasn't done anything unusual.

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,880
I occasionally heard her
mention the Jiang Family.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,750
Nothing else happened

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,710
besides that.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,840
I didn't call you to gather her news.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,670
I just feel that

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
someone around her is using her

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,920
and setting her up.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
Young Master,

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,710
you rarely trust others like this.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,760
She's different.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,070
I'm willing to bet on it.

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,870
No need to let others know.

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,430
I understand.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,590
Investigate

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,350
everyone who used
the Universal Ointment.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,840
I want to see

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,510
who's betraying me.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,100
(Mu Xi)

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Jiading.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,710
Is today's class kitchen practice?

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,070
No, no.

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,480
I got all the right answers of

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,700
Miss Min's challenge for today.

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,230
As a reward,

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,950
she's cooking for me.

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
How many servings?

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,590
Miss Min said

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,960
there's a portion for you too.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,650
I'll go check how things are going.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
Then I'll join you.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,400
No kids allowed

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
in the kitchen area.

43
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,520
Alright.

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,520
I'll leave you alone.

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
What's going on?

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,120
Jiading wants Yecheng delicacies.

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm making dumplings for him.

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,280
I'll knead the dough.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,910
(What's up with him?)

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
What?

51
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,680
The villain can't cook?

52
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,870
Mr. Qin,

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
I didn't mean it.

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
No worries.

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,910
That's an apt description.

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm not upset.

57
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,430
Mr. Qin,

58
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,590
you're forgiving.

59
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,360
What's this?

60
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,520
It's the rice wine I made.

61
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,080
You should avoid

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,910
anything related to alcohol.

63
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
Why?

64
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,630
I'm good with alcohol.

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,910
Last night you got drunk and

66
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,560
entered my room on purpose?

67
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,110
I

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
barged into your room?

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,590
Take a closer look at

70
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,310
this place.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,750
(That wasn't a dream.)

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,630
I remember now.

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,150
It seems like

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
you weren't completely drunk.

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,920
Not bad.

76
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,270
Did you two start from

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,160
growing wheat?

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
I'm starving.

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Coming right up.

80
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,830
Hurry up.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,750
I'm so hungry I might pass out.

82
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,120
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

83
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Careful, it's hot.

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,270
The dumplings are ready.

85
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,830
No need to fry them up in your mouth.

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,950
It's easy to make you laugh.

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,120
Laugh if you want.

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,240
We don't have rules against laughing.

89
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,360
I never expected you

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,870
to have such a humorous side.

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,480
My uncle has many sides.

92
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
You'll get to know him over time.

93
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,680
(Here we go with the sales pitch again.)

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,920
(This little guy is persistent.)

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Jiading,

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,070
how would you rate my cooking?

97
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,630
It's excellent.

98
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,870
Do you often cook for someone you fancy,

99
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,720
and your skills got so good?

100
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,720
What do kids like you know about this?

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,360
My current task is

102
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,870
to educate you for success

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and try to become the top female tutor.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
You've been close with
Jiang Dong lately.

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,270
Is he bothering you, or

106
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,270
do you have feelings for him?

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,310
That's because of Lu Yuchi.

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,830
Mr. Jiang wants to invest in
Lu Yuchi's movie.

109
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,270
I'm just offering some help.

110
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,150
(Just as expected.)

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,720
(The person I fancy)

112
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,270
(won't be fooled by Jiang Dong.)

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Miss Min,

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
your rice wine is amazing.

115
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,680
My uncle would like it.

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,950
Let's toast with this fine

117
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,070
to thank Miss Min for
the Yecheng delicacies.

118
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,950
And I should thank you

119
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,560
for your recognition and support.

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
Cheers.

121
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
Cheers.

I was careless. Are you okay?

144
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,000
No worries.

I'll do it, Miss Min.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,150
Dong Xing Universal Cream
and Qin's Universal Ointment

148
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,200
have the same ingredients?

149
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,870
Miss Min, I'm begging you.

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,360
Please pretend you didn't see it.

151
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,240
Mr. Qin instructed

152
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,030
that you must not know about this.

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
Jiang Dong's Dong Xing Pharmacy

154
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,870
started selling early the ointment

155
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,350
that Young Master developed for years.

156
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,550
This severely impacted
Qin Pharmaceuticals.

157
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,870
This is no coincidence.

158
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,320
Either Jiang Dong stole the formula,

159
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,870
or they had access to

160
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,150
Qin's Universal Ointment.

161
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,630
I put the Universal
Ointment in your bag.

162
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,670
Change it on time.

163
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,270
Don't let anyone use
your injury as an excuse.

164
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,990
Oh, you left your bag
in my car last night.

165
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,000
You're so forgetful.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,510
You've been close to Jiang Dong lately.

167
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,670
Is it because he's

168
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,510
pestering you or

169
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,750
do you have feelings for him?

170
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
So

171
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,670
Mr. Qin isn't curious about

172
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,360
me and Jiang Dong.

173
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,120
He's testing me.

174
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,270
Min Jiangxi came to confront Jiang Dong

175
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,510
to clear her name.

176
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
With Jiang Dong's nature,

177
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,320
he'll try to ally her.

178
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,320
If Min Jiangxi slips up even once,

179
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I'll make sure she gets stuck.

180
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,320
Xi.

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,120
You didn't get scared.

182
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,840
Why didn't you come home today

183
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,510
but insist on meeting me privately?

184
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,670
I said they had a close relationship.

185
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,870
You thought I was paranoid.

186
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,720
Min Jiangxi can't escape responsibility

187
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,270
about the prescription leak.

188
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Brother,

189
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,150
I'm grateful to the Jiang Family

190
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,630
for the kindness to me and Mom.

191
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,870
But

192
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,960
did you use our relationship

193
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,630
to harm Mr. Qin?

194
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,150
Are you implying something?

195
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
What did I do wrong?

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,870
Give me a clear hint.

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,270
There was Mr. Qin's unreleased
Universal Ointment

198
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,240
in the handbag I left in your car.

199
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,440
But now it's missing.

200
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,670
Did you take it?

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,030
Dong Xing Universal Cream's formula

202
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,630
is the same as

203
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,670
the one Mr. Qin developed.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,630
Don't you think it's coincidental?

205
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,080
So, you think I copied
Qin Zhan's formula,

206
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,920
right?

207
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,630
Since the formulas are the same,

208
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,510
why don't you think
Qin Zhan copied mine?

209
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Just because I like to compete with him?

210
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,550
The timeline doesn't add up.

211
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,320
Mr. Qin's ointment was launched first.

212
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,510
You only started selling recently.

213
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,870
Since timelines can be evidence,

214
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
do you realize that

215
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,630
the day after you left
your bag in my car,

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,360
Dong Xing Universal Ointment
was released?

217
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,030
And it'd take at least a month

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,320
to analyze the formula

219
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,720
and sell the products.

220
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,510
Am I a thief or a wizard to you?

221
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,550
How can you prove this timeline?

222
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,750
If you don't believe me,

223
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,480
I'll have the accountant
bring the books.

224
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,670
You can see

225
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,670
when the medicine started profiting.

226
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,550
(Jiang Dong speaks with conviction.)

227
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
(Maybe)

228
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,870
(he isn't as bad as I thought.)

229
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,510
No need.

230
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,550
But I will investigate this.

231
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,080
You treat me like

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,670
a thief

233
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,510
to defend Qin.

234
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
Do you like him?

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,870
That's my business.

236
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,960
No need for your concern.

237
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,910
I'm your brother.

238
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,670
How can I not care about

239
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,960
your life decisions?

240
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
You're not my real brother.

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,750
(So they recognized
each other as siblings.)

242
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,320
(Siblings?)

243
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,360
(Why didn't Qian mention this?)

244
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,630
Mr. Qin.

245
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,910
Qin, you coward.

246
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,550
You don't stand up for yourself

247
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,670
but send a girl to confront me?

248
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,360
It's not on Mr. Qin's orders.

249
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,670
This is my decision.

250
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,910
It's not about who argues better.

251
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,510
You know

252
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,030
where you got the formula.

253
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,960
- Zhan.
- Mr. Qin.

254
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
In Qin Zhan's eyes,

255
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,870
you're on the same boat with me.

256
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,320
Do you think he still trusts you?

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,700
Being with him is like
being with a tiger.

258
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,790
I can't let you

259
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,240
to stay by his side.

260
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,910
Why not take this chance
to move back home?

261
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,510
I won't leave until the truth is found.

262
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,120
I hope when Mr. Qin
holds me accountable,

263
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,510
you can fairly say

264
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,320
that the prescription
wasn't leaked by me.

265
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,550
I'll halt production now

266
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,270
and trace the prescription's source.

267
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,630
I won't implicate you.

268
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,420
