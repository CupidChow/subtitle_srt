00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,280
Qian is your driver.

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,960
Everyone in Shencheng knows him.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,840
You asked him to pick up Min Jiangxi.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,390
People will think

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,390
she has something to do
with the Qin Family.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm considering Miss Min's reputation.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,550
I'll see who dares to question

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,280
the decision I made.

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,430
I'm just offering sincere advice,

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,670
considering the way the world is.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,790
Only women truly understand
a woman's plight.

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,040
Right, Miss Min?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm employed by Mr. Qin.

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,430
My reputation doesn't affect others.

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,640
In what capacity are you

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,950
warning me?

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,150
Uncle considers Miss Min family.

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,000
In Shencheng, no one can do
anything to our family.

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,750
You should take care of yourself.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Zhan, I have something else to do.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,950
I'll come tomorrow for your birthday.

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,560
Running away when she can't win?

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,200
You're quite good at comebacks.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
Let's head home.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,190
Sure.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,480
Wait a moment.

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,790
Let's visit Jiang's Pharmacy.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,680
Alright.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Mr. Qin,

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,950
was my attitude towards Miss Feng

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,070
a bit too much?

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,910
You seemed pretty fierce.

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,400
Now you feel scared?

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm just hired to fend off admirers.

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,710
But I worry my lack of experience.

44
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,360
You even figured out my ploy.

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,400
You're so clever.

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Just manage the balance yourself.

47
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,080
The Qin and Feng Families are linked.

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm afraid

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,030
I might affect your family's business.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
That would be a real loss.

51
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,520
Our family has come this far

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
without any external forces.

53
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,710
You've done a great job.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
No need to overthink things.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,030
Besides, you're

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,660
much more interesting

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
than my past romantic flings.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,590
I came to your family just
to teach and earn money

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,400
with no other intentions.

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm not short of women.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,910
Even if I like someone, it's mutual.

62
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,030
I never force anyone.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,030
You don't need to guard against me.

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,430
I'm not.

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,030
I'm content with the present.

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm not that greedy.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,030
(I'm not a monster.)

68
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,400
(Why not be a bit greedy?)

69
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,750
I wish Miss Min could join our family.

70
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,870
But she...

71
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,080
Why can't she fancy Uncle?

72
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,030
Please spare me.

73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Why are you up this late acting strange?

74
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,240
What do you want to do?

75
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,600
Uncle, I can't sleep. I'm worried.

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Speak up.

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,750
Don't you think

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,360
Miss Min was charming today?

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,390
That's what's bothering you?

80
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes, she's beautiful and smart.

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
She could even silence that woman.

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,750
A perfect person like that
doesn't move you?

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,950
I…

84
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,560
I have no improper thoughts.

85
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,630
(Not telling the truth, huh?)

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
(Time for a special move then.)

87
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,590
Uncle,

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
what do you think of Miss Min

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,160
being my stepmom?

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,000
Your reaction makes me wonder.

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,390
Why are you matchmaking randomly?

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
You have no thoughts

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,600
on Miss Min

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,070
being my stepmom?

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
A lot.

96
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,120
The kindness of raising is greater.

97
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
But in good times,
you think of your dad first.

98
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,150
Ungrateful.

99
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,560
My dad is tall, handsome, and rich.

100
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
And his reputation's better than yours.

101
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,830
Miss Min might

102
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,870
like him more.

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,160
Let's respect who's first.

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,190
Then you pursue her first.

105
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,950
If you can't, I'll ask my dad.

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
If Miss Min doesn't fancy you both,

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,750
we can't let others have the chance.

108
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,190
In two years when I grow up,

109
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,750
I can marry her then.

110
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,630
She's not interested in

111
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,240
your dad who's burdened with you,

112
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
let alone you.

113
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,120
So, this means

114
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,120
your chances are higher?

115
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,390
But Miss Min isn't interested in you.

116
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,910
Get lost.

117
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,790
Ungrateful.

118
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
I'm handsome.

119
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,900
(Grab Your Love, Directed by Lu Yuchi)

120
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,510
The script is well-written.

121
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,600
(Grab Your Love, Directed by Lu Yuchi)
I have no problems.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,160
It's just the five women in the play

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
can be played by my mistresses.

124
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,910
Your mistress

125
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,870
can't play

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
five roles.

127
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,680
How do you know I have
only one mistress?

128
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,160
Sorry, Mr. Zhou,

129
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,240
these roles are significant.

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,390
We need experienced actors.

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,150
- Jiang, when will we meet again?
- It doesn't matter how well it's acted.

132
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,430
- Jiang, you've had too much to drink.
- They...

133
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,360
- Let me take you home.
- It's like being a movie star.

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,800
Isn't this Min Jiangxi and

135
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,430
her friend?

136
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,040
I've got something to do. You go ahead.

137
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,390
- Jiang, call us.
- Right now?

138
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,000
- Hurry up.
- That's because you don't have money.

139
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,390
I do.

140
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,830
I'm never stingy

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,600
with women.

142
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,070
Miss Min,

143
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
name your price.

144
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Mr. Zhou,

145
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,160
we trust your financial capacity.

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
But this movie

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,240
(Grab Your Love, Directed by Lu Yuchi)
can't meet your needs.

148
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,240
Maybe we can collaborate next time.

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,600
It's the thought that counts, right?

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,190
If we can

151
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
take it a step further,

152
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
I'll cover all the expenses

153
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
of the movie.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,840
This…

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
Mr. Zhou.

156
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,350
Mr. Zhou.

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,830
Do you have a leg issue?

158
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,270
Maybe Miss Min can help.

159
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,560
Either part will do.

160
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,480
Are you out of your mind?

161
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
You are.

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,390
Your mind is full of nonsense.

163
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,950
Be careful, you might get into trouble.

164
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,000
Save your money for a rainy day.

165
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,750
You dare to mess with me?

166
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
You!

167
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Who are you?

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,270
You're the first

169
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,600
who dares to insult me

170
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,080
in Shencheng.

171
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,790
Ouch, it hurts.

172
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,000
Mr. Jiang Dong.

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Shencheng Double Villains?

174
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,910
Yes, this is one of the
Shencheng Double Villains,

175
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,480
Jiang Dong, Mr. Jiang.

176
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,320
Mr. Jiang, it's a misunderstanding.

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,160
Shut up.

178
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
What's going on?

179
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,000
He rubbed my leg with his foot.

180
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,870
Kick back.

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
Alright.

182
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,390
Hold it in.

183
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,360
You dare touch my woman?

184
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
Apologize.

185
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,960
Mr. Jiang, I was blind.

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
I was wrong.

187
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,510
I beg you.

188
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,790
Let me go.

189
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,630
Get lost.

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,240
If this were a movie,

191
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,790
I'd hit him hard.

192
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,630
There are plenty of these guys around.

193
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,790
Can I take them all on?

194
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,960
Was I cool just now?

195
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,440
Mr. Jiang is the coolest in Shencheng.

196
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,030
I'm your lifesaver.

197
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,000
How do you plan to thank me?

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,440
Why do you smell like perfume?

199
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,000
As a return favor,

200
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,390
we won't take up your time.

201
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,110
Sit down.

202
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,510
I have plenty of time.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,030
Every time I see you,

204
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,910
you're either looking for
money or actors.

205
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,030
Empty-handed like you,

206
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,670
are you still trying to make movies?

207
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,440
I believe persistence pays off.

208
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,440
In today's world,

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,000
can dreams alone accomplish anything?

210
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,900
Let's get back to business.

211
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
Both our names have Jiang.

212
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,150
You're Jiangxi.

213
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm Jiang Dong.

214
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,270
East and West, it's fate.

215
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,000
I can invest in your film.

216
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
What do you think?

217
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,630
Want to be friends?

218
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,080
No need, Mr. Jiang.

219
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,960
We can think of another way.

220
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
Shencheng is quite complex.

221
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,120
What if you two run into
real trouble someday?

222
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,790
I can't always promise
to show up in time.

223
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
I...

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,240
As a token of appreciation,

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,240
I allow you two to treat me
to dinner tonight.

226
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Mr. Jiang,

227
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
tonight is Mr. Qin's birthday party.

228
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,440
Let's meet again by chance.

229
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Is this how you thank your lifesaver?

230
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,670
I'm not happy about this.

231
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,750
Mr. Jiang.

232
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,000
As a thank you,

233
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,550
this magical perfume is for you.

234
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,800
Please accept it.

235
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Are you crazy?

236
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,440
What treasure can't you part with?

237
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,390
For self-defense.

238
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,510
But only use it in emergencies.

239
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,200
You're just making it mysterious.

240
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,630
(I regret it, what should I do?)

241
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,270
(Time to run away.)

242
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,750
Goodbye.

243
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,910
That's for self-defense, why bring it?

244
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,440
Boys need to protect themselves too.

245
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,030
What should I do? I'm regretting it.

246
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,960
Let's leave.

247
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,550
Lu Yuchi.

248
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Perfume from "the wrong person".

249
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,440
So spicy.

250
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,440
Lu Yuchi, how dare you trick me?

251
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,380
