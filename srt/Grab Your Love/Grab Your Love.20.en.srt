I forgot the book.

10
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,950
Perspective is crucial.

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,120
Start drawing from there.

12
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,790
Uncle.

13
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,070
You brought me fruit.

14
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,710
Is this an art class?

15
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,150
Keep drawing.

16
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,510
Did you two argue?

17
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,990
As expected.

18
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,120
It feels like my parents might separate

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
and I'm caught in between.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
Looks like you can draw now.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,710
Finish the painting for me by tomorrow.

22
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,990
Uncle,

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
can you get it for me too?

24
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,590
Dream on.

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,080
When will these days

26
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,710
ever end?

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,030
(In the face of family feud,)

28
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,470
(I shouldn't hope for romance.)

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,190
Miss Min, Mr. Jiang is here to see you.

30
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,190
I'm on my way down.

31
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,960
Why are you here?

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,960
I came to take you to Shencheng's
annual Lantern Festival.

33
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,150
It's lively.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
But I

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,470
don't want to go.

36
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,520
Typical of Qin.

37
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,520
It's not festive.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,270
What are you thinking?

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
It's getting late.

40
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,150
If we don't leave now,
we'll miss a good spot.

41
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,550
I…

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,710
Didn't you say we'd see
the lantern festival?

43
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,000
Why are we here instead?

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
It's deserted. Kind of spooky.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,560
The highlight of the festival

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
is solving riddles for big prizes.

47
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,310
I got an insider tip.

48
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,560
The grand prize is hidden
between these alleys.

49
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,710
Let's split up.

50
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,150
You go that way. I'll go this way.

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,520
Come on, let's go.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
I…

53
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,870
Come on.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,510
Don't follow me. I have a gun.

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
I won't look at you.
I won't turn you in.

56
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,070
Don't hurt me.

57
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,350
Min Jiangxi.

58
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,360
Mr. Qin.

59
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,190
Why are you here?

60
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,950
I know you're hiding from me.

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not.

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,120
Do you know that you don't

63
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,430
have to worry about

64
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,120
the big villain of Shencheng?

65
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,800
The Feng Family

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,310
can't do anything to me.

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,240
I won't allow you to

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,270
push me away like this.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,040
I want to stand by you.

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Is that okay?

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,510
I'm worried about your safety.

72
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,390
It doesn't matter.

73
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,510
I'm kneeling

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
for either death

75
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,350
or marriage.

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Choose one.

77
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,190
Mr. Qin,

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,040
you're easy to misunderstand.

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,950
No misunderstanding.

80
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm confessing.

81
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,950
Min Jiangxi.

82
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,230
I like you.

83
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,390
Mr. Qin,

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
are you thinking

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,680
that once we're family,

86
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,040

(Congratulations on)

111
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,300
(winning over my sister.)

112
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,270
Congratulations, Uncle.

113
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,320
This is your favorite grape flower.

114
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Thoughtful.

115
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,910
So

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
you knew about this all along?

117
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,510
I often messed with Qin's plans.

118
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,120
I thought I'd do some good.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,670
My sister is capable of

120
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,550
letting me enjoy being asked for help

121
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,360
by Qin.

122
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,750
I couldn't watch her face danger alone.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,390
But she treats me like an outsider.

124
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,720
This is tricky.

125
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,480
So you want to

126
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,840
become an insider?

127
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,080
As for winning girls over,

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,270
leave it to me.

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,480
With your little betrayal,

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,910
we'll win her heart.

131
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,150
I'm not a traitor.

132
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,720
But

133
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,480
if you truly treat Xi well,

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I can lend you a hand.

135
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,110
Then

136
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,150
thank you both in advance.

137
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,390
Though I'm two days younger,

138
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,080
can you call me

139
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,080
"Brother"

140
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
if this works out?

141
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
Um.

142
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,910
I'm a few days older than Xi,

143
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,200
could you also call me?

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,360
Let's discuss requests after success.

145
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Just call me Brother.

146
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,080
Why are the three of you together?

147
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,080
Your uncle asked me to
help him pursue your tutor.

148
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,320
I want to help too.

149
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,480
Even you're hiding this from me.

150
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
No.

151
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,360
This is the mastermind.

152
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,480
This is the strategist.

153
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,910
Jiading and I just tag along.

154
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,390
Pity all my love advice was wasted.

155
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,200
You didn't utter a single word.

156
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,240
It's all nonsense.

157
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,320
Stubborn as ever.

158
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,440
You won't like it.

159
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,120
Though the plan isn't perfect,

160
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,750
the ending is satisfying.

161
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,510
We've been frozen here all night.

162
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
But it was worth it.

163
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,120
Now I'm not an outsider.

164
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Can I handle

165
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,150
your affairs now?

166
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Uncle,

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
do I have an aunt now?

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Call her.

169
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Aunt.

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Aunt.

171
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,960
A few more times.

172
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,870
Aunt.

173
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
Now you're shy?

174
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,870
The cause of my home's fire

175
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,390
was an ancient painting.

176
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,120
But Lin Guangyao is a crude person.

177
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,600
Why cause such trouble over a painting?

178
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,750
In recent years, Lin Guangyao

179
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,910
has been helping
Feng Yuanzhang with dirty work.

180
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,670
We can't rule out
Feng Family's involvement.

181
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,360
The underground boss
and Shencheng's top official.

182
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,870
These two are colluding together.

183
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,670
The people of Shencheng are in trouble.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
The painting is likely
with the mastermind.

185
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
So as long as we find the painting,

186
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,080
we can find the real culprit.

187
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,320
It seems like you have a plan.

188
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,230
Chi,

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
do your eyes hurt?

190
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,480
