00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,960
Mom.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,030
I am Xi.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,560
Do you remember me?

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,640
Xi.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,740
(Snow swirling everywhere)

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,030
The writing is fluent and meaningful.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,110
It's truly worthy of my teaching.

16
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,870
The more you praise her,
the higher she aims.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,840
She's eighteen and still unmarried.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,280
May I ask this talented girl,

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,350
when do you plan to marry?

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,430
Dad.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,120
Xi inherited your beauty

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,710
and my intelligence.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,250
She's the finest girl out there.

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,280
So she'll marry the best guy.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,760
There's no rush, right?

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,840
Dad's right.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,280
I want to pass Dad's wisdom on

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,510
to more people.

29
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,950
I'm not in a hurry to marry.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,510
Alright, I can't argue with you.

31
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,780
Ruying.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,480
Even if you can't beat us,

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,040
don't take it out
on the family treasure.

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,310
This rare painting is Xi's dowry.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,000
Come on, don't be upset.

36
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,310
You are Xi.

37
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,280
You are Xi.

38
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,760
- Mom.
- Xi.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,120
Mom.

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,910
I thought you were gone

41
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,680
after that big fire.

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,470
Fire?

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,770
Quick!

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,990
Xi!

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Xi!

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Is anyone here?

47
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,520
- Is someone inside?
- Here!

48
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,430
Help!

49
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,750
Save my daughter first!

50
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,150
Hang on.

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,120
Wait for me to save you.

52
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,550
I…

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,710
I was sure I extinguished all flames.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,470
How did such a big fire start?

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,960
Neighbors confirmed during the rescue

56
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,360
that the fire started in Dad's study.

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,080
The study couldn't have a fire source.

58
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,910
Your dad cherished his books the most.

59
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,630
He never used open flames in there.

60
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,520
Mom, please think again.

61
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,430
Did

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
anything unusual happen

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
or did any strange person visit

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,630
before the fire.

65
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,870
There was indeed one person.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,920
I just remember a scar on his hand.

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,160
Name your price.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
I want this painting.

69
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,480
You have a keen eye.

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,390
But I'm really sorry.

71
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,920
This painting is for
my daughter's future dowry

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
and not for sale.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Old man,

74
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
don't test my patience.

75
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,160
Just sell me the painting

76
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,950
while I'm willing to pay now.

77
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,120
Otherwise

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,120
don't blame me for being harsh.

79
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,310
There's no room for negotiation.

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
That's all.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,310
Old man.

82
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,120
Just wait.

83
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,310
It must be him.

84
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,070
He set the fire after failing to trade.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Ruying.

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,630
You're not well. Stay calm.

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,670
Understand?

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Besides,

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
we're just speculating.

90
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,800
There's no evidence.

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
No.

92
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,110
Listen to me.

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
We need to

94
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,800
plan carefully.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
Okay?

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
It must be him.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,870
He ruined our family.

98
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,560
But I don't know who he is.

99
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,800
- Mom.
- Ruying.

100
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,430
Let us handle this.

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
Aren't you reassured about your son's

102
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,120
connections and strength?

103
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,600
Mom.

104
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,920
Young Master, I'm back.

105
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,480
Where's Min Jiangxi?

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,070
Miss Min was taken by Jiang Dong.

107
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,710
Young Master,

108
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,720
Mr. Lu was there too.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,350
They said it was an apology dinner.

110
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,350
Everything seems normal.

111
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,720
Alright, got it.

112
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,670
Go ahead.

113
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,150
No wonder I felt a special connection

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,750
from the first time I met you.

115
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,870
It turns out we have the same mom.

116
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
How did you end up together?

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Can you satisfy my curiosity?

118
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Back in those days,

119
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,750
downstream of Yecheng River,

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,800
I found Ruying barely alive.

121
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,920
She remembered nothing

122
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,630
at that time.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,160
I worried she'd have no support,

124
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,720
so I brought her to Shencheng.

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,040
My dad wouldn't save just anyone.

126
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,120
He found my mom beautiful.

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,960
Yes.

128
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,720
I pursued her for a long time

129
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,480
before she agreed to marry me.

130
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
So touching.

131
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,390
I want to write your story

132
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,040
into my next movie.

133
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
- I'll invest.
- Great.

134
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,510
Mr. Jiang,

135
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,120
thank you for saving my mom.

136
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,270
Come on.

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,510
Based on age,

138
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm technically
the eldest son of our mom.

139
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,270
It isn't too much for you
to call me "big brother", right?

140
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,270
You can't get rid of him now.

141
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,710
I, Jiang Dong,

142
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,510
officially become siblings
with Min Jiangxi today.

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,630
From now on, we'll support
each other through thick and thin.

144
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,250
With our parents as witnesses,

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
we affirm this bond.

146
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,270
To you.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
Xi,

148
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,920
I heard from Dong
that you work at Qin's.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,390
Is it dangerous or tough?

150
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,310
Why not just quit the job?

151
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,750
We can easily support

152
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,120
another daughter.

153
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,270
This way we won't

154
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,360
have to be worried.

155
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
Mom,

156
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,560
it's not as exaggerated as he says.

157
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,030
They treat me well.

158
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,360
They pay a high salary too.

159
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Yeah.

160
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,320
Someone troubled Xi before.

161
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,030
It was Mr. Qin who protected her.

162
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
Everyone in Shencheng knows

163
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
Xi has the Qin Family backing her.

164
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,320
No one dares to bully her.

165
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
Yes.

166
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
That's good.

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,960
The arsonist

168
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
had murderous intent.

169
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,960
If he knew anyone survived,

170
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,080
he wouldn't stop.

171
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,630
Listen.

172
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,240
Don't openly acknowledge each other

173
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,870
to avoid drawing attention.

174
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,870
Leave the rest

175
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,750
to Dong.

176
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm so happy today.

177
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
Let me make another toast.

178
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,320
Come on.

179
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,480
Let's have a toast.

180
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
Xi.

181
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,720
You've drank so much today.

182
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Stay the night.

183
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,470
Alright.

184
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,670
But I have a class early tomorrow.

185
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,750
I might not make it in time.

186
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,600
Alright.

187
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,240
We have plenty of time ahead.

188
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,350
I'll drive you home.

189
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
We've arrived.

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
We've arrived?

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
I'll walk you in.

192
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,630
No need.

193
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,080
I can go myself.

194
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,630
You're just afraid that
Qin Zhan will see me.

195
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,510
You always forget things.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,500
I'll just return it to her tomorrow.

197
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,670
You're getting bolder now.

198
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,350
You dared to enter my room

199
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,150
late at night.

200
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,960
The villain.

201
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,750
Did you drink with Jiang Dong?

202
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,720
Why are you in my room?

203
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Take a closer look at

204
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,120
this place.

205
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
This is...

206
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,120
This is...

207
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,270
I can do nothing to you.

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,240
Reflect on the poems'

209
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,670
deeper meanings.

210
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,550
Submit them before dinner.

211
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,440
Did you hear that?

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,510
Perhaps the poets didn't think that much

213
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,840
when they wrote the poems.

214
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,960
But we have to interpret
them word-for-word.

215
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,270
It's asking for trouble.

216
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,120
What are you saying?

217
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,000
Is 800 words enough?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
That's more like it.

219
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,510
Mr. Qin,I need to

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,200
step out for a bit.

221
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,120
I'll be back later.

222
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,280
Okay.

223
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,710
Focus on your homework.

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,030
Miss Min seems happy today.

225
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,790
I made several mistakes in class

226
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,870
and she didn't get upset.

227
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,670
They say women's moods change

228
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
when they're in love.

229
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm not sure if it's true.

230
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,080
It sounds like nonsense.

231
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,240
Smells like jealousy.

232
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,480
Lu Yuchi, why rush me here?

233
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,920
Brother.

234
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,750
Mr. Jiang suddenly visited

235
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,390
and insisted I bring you.

236
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,150
Only then would
he explain why he's here.

237
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,280
When did you

238
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,510
start hanging out?

239
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,810
- I…
- Sister,

240
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,870
mind your words.

241
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
That's right.

242
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,320
You made it sound like

243
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,910
we're involved.

244
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,360
We are involved.

245
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,870
The movie's investment would be settled.

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,320
Are you serious?

247
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,150
I may be indulgent,

248
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,840
but I

249
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,030
keep my word.

250
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,960
Wait.

251
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,630
You invested so much at once.

252
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,670
I'm feeling a lot of pressure.

253
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,120
No need to feel pressured.

254
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,500
It's wouldn't be your fault.

255
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,960
Anyway,

256
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,440
I got the money from the rich.

257
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,630
Who did you take it from?

258
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,350
It's ill-gotten money?

259
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,120
I can't accept that.

260
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,150
I took it from my dad.

261
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,910
He's very supportive.

262
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
It's not forcibly taken.

263
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,360
I want to see what's inside your heads.

264
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,630
What do you think I am?

265
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,790
- A great person.
- A great person.

266
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,910
Your attitude

267
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,670
makes me understand the saying

268
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,080
"Money makes the world go round."

269
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm moved by wealth,

270
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,270
wanting to bond with you like brothers.

271
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,750
Get up.

272
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,510
Who wants to be your brother?

273
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,550
I don't care.

274
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,670
I'm sticking with you.

275
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,840
Dear brother.

276
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,550
That's disgusting.

277
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,720
That's pleasing.

278
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,390
By the way, you left

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,670
your bag in your car last night.

280
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,360
You're always so forgetful.

281
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
Thanks, bro.

282
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Drinking causes trouble.

283
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,660
(Cordyceps Beauty Cream)

284
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Zhan,

285
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,320
I'm just too naive.

286
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,670
That's why Ding Bining tricked me twice.

287
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,870
Guide me in the future,

288
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,120
so I don't make bad friends again

289
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,480
and ruin our relationship.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,840
Alright?

291
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,900
(Mu Xi)
I'm busy with the herbal business.

292
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,860
I have no time for your affairs.

293
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,140
(Mu Xi)

294
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,720
If you don't have anything else to say,

295
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,590
please leave.

296
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Zhan.

297
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,720
Young Master, something big happened.

298
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,910
This is Jiang's new
Dong Xing Universal Cream.

299
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,440
Our pharmacist analyzed it.

300
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,030
It's exactly the same as

301
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,080
Mu Xi Universal Cream.

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,270
I remember

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
that this unreleased ointment

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,510
was only used by Min Jiangxi.

305
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,320
(Prescription)
She's been visiting Jiang's often.

306
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,870
Now this happened.

307
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,120
Is it a coincidence?

308
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,430
Yes.

309
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Lately, Miss Min keeps asking me
to take her to Jiang's.

310
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,320
And

311
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,080
she seems quite close with Jiang Dong.
