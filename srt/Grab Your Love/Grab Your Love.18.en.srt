00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,070
Young Master, is there something wrong?

10
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,630
I

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,400
have a friend who's had

12
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,870
some relationship issues

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,310
recently.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,960
You…

15
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,900
Does your friend have a crush on a girl?

16
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,560
Is she friendly

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,480
with everyone else,

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,230
but guarded

19
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,310
and distant

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,870
only to your friend?

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,120
How do you know?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,590
(Because I'm not blind.)

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,070
Actually,

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,640
it's simple between men and women.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Is there a solution?

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,920
Hold hands.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,710
Hug

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,150
and kiss.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,760
Or just be direct.

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,910
These don't work.

31
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,910
Young Master, you've tried them?

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
It's my friend.

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,990
Young Master,

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,840
you don't have any friends.

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
I…

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
Who says I don't?

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,400
I have plenty of friends.

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,870
Plenty.

39
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,120
Trust is where liking begins.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
When you chose to

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
unconditionally trust Miss Min,

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,910
I knew this day would come.

43
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,750
I need to discuss something with you.

The renowned leader of Shencheng

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,910
can't sleep

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,120
because of a tutor.

47
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,080
Stop it.

48
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,710
You interact most with Min Jiangxi.

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,840
Help me analyze from her perspective.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,710
Mr. Qin, go ahead.

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm good-looking, rich and

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
have a good personality, right?

53
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,910
Why does she always seem to

54
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,280
show me great respect,

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,840
but secretly avoids me like the plague?

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Tell me about it.

57
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,840
When I told her

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,470
I didn't mind her liking you,

59
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,150
she said,

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,710
"Stop beating around the bush."

61
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
She said,

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,560
"Who said I like him?"

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,550
Is it your looks or wealth

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,190
she dislikes?

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,080
Or is it his personality?

66
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,310
Uncle,

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
won't you hear some good advice first?

68
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
Speak.

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,310
Miss Min is not like

70
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,150
those socialites.

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,630
She won't like

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,910
cliché gifts

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,560

Get to the point.

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
What moves her

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,270
is sincerity.

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,830
If you like her,

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,870
give her

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,710
everything you value.

80
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,430

81
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,680
What if you made one yourself?

82
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Mr. Qin.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,520

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,590

86

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,310
Why are your ears so red?

88
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,910
I...

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,240
Mind your own business.

90
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,630
Do you need my guidance on the side?

91
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't need a third wheel.

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,630
What's with a third wheel?

93
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Third wheels can be expensive.

94
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,680

The one analyzing Miss Feng's
prescription is Lin Guangyao.

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,440

power behind him,

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,950
which is hard to uncover

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,320
for now.

133
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,710

134

What are you doing?

142

(Maybe it's just a coincidence.)

153

156
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,030
I want to thank him personally.

157
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
In the kitchen.

158
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,510
The kitchen?

159
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,270
I wonder if Miss Min

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,030
can see my uncle's intentions.

161
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,270
Mr. Chang, what's going on?

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,630
Why are you in such a hurry?

163
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,120
Miss Min, Young Master seems possessed.

164
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,790
He's locked himself
in the kitchen, doing rituals.

165
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,080
He won't let anyone in.

166
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,200
Rituals?

167
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
No way.

168
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,120
I need to find a feng shui master.

169
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes.

170
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,320

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440

175
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,720
I heard a noise.

176
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,840
Are you okay?

177
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,120
