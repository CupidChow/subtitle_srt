Thanks.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,950
Mr. Qin,

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,070
I want to move out.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,870
Why so suddenly?

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
What's the reason?

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,510
Though the Universal
Ointment issue is over,

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,710
those who failed won't give up.

17
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,680
I don't want to stay here

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,510
and be a pawn to hurt you.

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,950
You don't need to worry about that.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,310
No one can touch me.

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,350
Plus, I've reunited with my mom.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,680
I'll visit the Jiang Family more.

23
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,350
I guess that's the main point.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,150
You're planning to move there?

25
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,280
Although Mr. Jiang and I
call each other siblings,

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,150
I'm still an outsider.

27
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,680
I wouldn't want to trouble them.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,680
I'll find a new place to live.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
(You always consider others first.)

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,590
(I'll have to be your support.)

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,070
First of all,

32
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,150
I'm not incapable.

33
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,310
I can protect myself

34
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,280
and also keep you safe.

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,270
Secondly,

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
I'm not narrow-minded.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
I won't stop you from reuniting with

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,470
your mother.

39
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,590
But Jiading has been

40
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,960
unmotivated lately for his test.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,310
He needs more classes.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,800
You have to stay here.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Jiading has been doing great.

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,080
Last time, he solved
all the questions correctly

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,430
and we made dumplings for him.

46
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,280
Did you forget?

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Yes.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
Mr. Qin.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Alright.

50
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,470
I'll wait until Jiading's test is over.

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Dong,

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,120
we searched all over Yecheng

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,280
but didn't find the scarred
man Madam mentioned.

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
Maybe he's left Yecheng.

55
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,400
Check the surroundings too.

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,910
Expand the search gradually.

57
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,190
Even if he's dead,

58
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,710
dig him out of his grave for me.

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,470
Alright, got it.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,910
This is like finding
a needle in a haystack.

61
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,680
Leader, Miss advises you
to stay low for now.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,800
Qin and Jiang families
are investigating the formula.

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,150
Who do you work for?

64
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,400
How dare you track me?

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,470
If I knew she was ruining
the Shencheng Villains' business,

66
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,560
I wouldn't help her even
for a hundred gold bars.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,910
Darn it.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,910
She used me as a steppingstone?

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,910
I'll deal with her sooner or later.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,310
My foot hurts. Bring me my shoes.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
That dark line.

72
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,800
To keep Jiading focused in class,

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,750
I'll audit all future lessons.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,870
This is Jiading's favorite art class.

75
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,360
He's focused.

76
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,270
Mr. Qin, no need to audit.

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Really?

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,120
With Uncle here, I'll be diligent.

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
By the way, Miss Min,

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
you've taught me art for so long

81
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,720
but haven't shown your skills.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,920
How about a match with me?

83
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,670
Sure.

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,480
Let's

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,270
continue with the orange.

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
Draw my uncle.

87
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Portraits take a long time.

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
I guess Mr. Qin is busy.

89
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
Start.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Alright.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
Miss Min,

92
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,720
how did you teach me to draw muscles?

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,190
In our family, no one

94
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,750
has more defined muscles than my uncle.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,840
Uncle,

96
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,190
could you demonstrate for us?

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,390
(Villain,)

98
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,950
(that's an unreasonable request.)

99
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,310
(Refuse it.)

100
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,120
For Jiading's artistic development,

101
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,360
I can only dedicate myself to it.

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
(You're not really going
to strip, are you?)

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,560
(You don't think I actually
won't do it, do you?)

104
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,120
The competition begins.

105
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,870
(Start drawing.)

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,870
(No, I need to be professional.)

107
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
(Feeling shy?)

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Does it feel good?

109
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,720
(Oh my gosh.)

110
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,360
(Min Jiangxi, what are you thinking?)

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,920
(This is a rare opportunity.)

112
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,360
(You better watch)

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,480
(my calm and handsome looks.)

114
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,070
(No, he's so fierce.)

115
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,550
(He must be pretending to be
generous about the prescription.)

116
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,600
(Once Jiading no longer needs me,)

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,310
(He'll discard me like trash.)

118
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,680
(Look at how shy you are.)

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,480
(You must be captivated by me.)

120
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
(Good taste.)

121
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,920
(His sharp jawline)

122
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,680
(looks quite good though.)

123
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,350
Done.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm done too.

125
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,800
Let me give some feedback.

126
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,790
Why am I wearing clothes?

127
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,720
I was worried you'd feel cold.

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,360
How thoughtful of you.

129
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Let me see.

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Miss Min.

131
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,670
Your drawing isn't as realistic as mine.

132
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
Jiading,

133
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,120
how have I taught you?

134
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
Be humble.

135
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
Yes, yes.

136
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,870
Miss Min usually paints well.

137
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,910
This time you must

138
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,360
be distracted by my uncle's looks.

139
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,270
That's not true!

140
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm not attractive?

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
I didn't mean that.

142
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
I just messed it up.

143
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,840
I get it.

144
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,120
(You don't.)

145
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,360
(Which guy sent this to her?)

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,670
(I need to surpass him.)

147
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,960
Hang this painting in your room.

148
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,390
Don't take it down

149
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,750
until it looks as handsome as me.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm still unmarried.

151
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,120
I can't hang a man's portrait

152
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,360
in the room.

153
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,870
Then just look at it and paint well.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,480
When you're done,

155
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,910
I'll pay a hundred dollars to buy it.

156
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,710
Deal.

157
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
I can't believe you prefer a mere

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,870
hundred dollars compared to my uncle.

159
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,120
Mere?

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,670
You are beyond teaching.

161
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,510
I…

162
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,630
The Yecheng delicacies
are homemade by Madam.

163
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,490
And this

164
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,480
is the scented liquid bought by

165
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Dong from France.

166
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,000
Perfume?

167
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,200
Yes, perfume.

168
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,320
Thank Mr. Jiang for me.

169
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,480
I'll visit them another day.

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,720
(She's getting bolder.)

171
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,670
(She dares to show off in front of me.)

172
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,160
Mr. Qin,

173
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,200
these are homemade snacks by my mom.

174
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,630
She's grateful for your support

175
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,000
and made these for you.

176
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,720
If you don't have an appetite,

177
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,670
I can give them to Jiading.

178
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,670
It's your mom's thoughtful gesture.

179
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,790
It'd be quite rude

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
if I don't eat them.

181
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,910
It does taste great.

182
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,320
As good as famous pastry shops.

183
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,150
Sweets suit your taste.

184
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,390
But

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,870
Shencheng and Yecheng's customs

186
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,480
and food habits differ.

187
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,960
Is your mother adjusting well?

188
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,750
My mom is doing well.

189
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,240
Mr. Jiang hired servants from Yecheng

190
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,630
to take care of her needs.

191
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,470
That's good.

192
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,870
You should spend more time together.

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
But

194
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,480
you should continue living here.

195
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,670
It's convenient for teaching Jiading.

196
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,960
I won't let it get
in the way of my work.

197
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,750
That's reassuring.

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,200
I opened a Herbal Cuisine Shop
in the east of the city.

199
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,510
Take Madam there for some
supplements when you have time.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,270
Winters in Shencheng are warm.

201
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,550
She needs internal repair.

202
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,960
Okay, thank you.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,480
You guys ate without me.

204
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,390
There's some for you.

205
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,080
Here, try this.

206
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,670
Can't you use your hands?

207
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,230
Tasty.

208
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,510
Miss Min, it's time for class.

209
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,510
You spilled on my clothes.

210
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,510
Watch out.

211
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,800
Jiading.

212
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,670
(She's getting closer to Jiang Dong)

213
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,960
(and is gentle with Jiading.)

214
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,200
(But she's polite and distant with me.)

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,650
Hanging the painting of Shencheng's
villain at home wards off evil.

216
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,320
Come over here.

217
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,320
Jiading,

218
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,360
Mr. Qin is your uncle.

219
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,720
It's fine if others call him
Shencheng villain.

220
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,200
But why do you say that too?

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,510
I was just joking.

222
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,670
Some people always doubt

223
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,150
those at the top can stay clean.

224
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,750
They wish to blame him

225
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,080
for all sins.

226
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,320
I know you didn't mean it.

227
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,150
But Mr. Qin is a good person.

228
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,080
He shouldn't be blamed unfairly.

229
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,270
I didn't expect you

230
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,910
to understand my uncle so well.

231
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,150
(I'll)

232
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,320
(have her as my aunt.)

233
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,550
You should respect your uncle

234
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,480
and stop using that word.

235
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,030
Life is long.

236
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,150
Living with stigma

237
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,080
must be so painful.

238
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,510
I understand.

239
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,000
It seems like I can hope

240
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,120
she'll grow fond of me.

241
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,020
