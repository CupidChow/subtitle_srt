9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,750
I heard grapes with milk
can sober you up.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,760
Try it.

11
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,070
Grapes to sober up?

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,040
That's quite an idea.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,520
Uncle,

14
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,350
aren't you working with herbs lately?

15
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,040
Why switch to wine studies?

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,710
I was wondering if this grape

17
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,760
could dispel the effects of all wines.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,350
Using grapes to dispel wine,

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,870
who came up with such a remedy?

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
Min Jiangxi.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,200
Even kids wouldn't believe that.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,600
But you did.

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,790
Mr. Chang, we'll have

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,310
this grape variety from now on.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,150
Isn't it just…

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,150
Since Miss Min says
it helps with sobering up,

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,470
it must have hidden qualities.

28
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,590
Mr. Chang, I know why you're

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,360
steadfast in our family.

30
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,030
Alright, rest early.

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,800
Tomorrow, Min Jiangxi will move in.

32
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,120
Jiading, help Mr. Chang tidy up.

33
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,030
Does that mean

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,630
I get to see Miss Min every day?

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,430
(I wonder whose teacher
Miss Min really is.)

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,190
(Why does it seem like Uncle)

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,520
(listens to her more than I do?)

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,750
Uncle is odd.

39
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,750
Miss Min, come and see this.

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Wait a moment.

41
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,960
I suddenly noticed

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,590
you had dark circles under your eyes.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,190
Kid stuff. Grown-ups shouldn't ask much.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Alright.

45
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,910
I don't get it, but I respect it.

46
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,630
Let me show you around.

47
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,960
This is my room.

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,960
Miss Min, this is your room.

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,030
Uncle lives across the hall.

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,560
See, it's convenient
for the three of us.

51
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,800
Uncle drank too much last night.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,900
He hasn't woken up yet.

53
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,190
Come on, I'll show you your room.

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Alright.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,430
Look, isn't it nice?

56
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,190
Isn't it a bit inappropriate to live

57
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,250
so close to the employer?

58
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,800
You noticed

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,870
how unreasonable this is too, right?

60
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm here for work.

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,720
I can stay with the staff.

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,240
I arranged a room

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,720
for you downstairs.

64
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,240
But Uncle said it wasn't convenient.

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,750
It's the first time Uncle let
a woman stay at our house.

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,120
He even arranged for you
to stay next door.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,830
Be honest.

68
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,560
Are you two hiding something from me?

69
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,430
Mr. Qin just wants me

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,000
to keep a close watch on

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,560
your studying.

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,720
If you slack off again,

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,070
I'll report you.

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,190
Why do I feel like inviting trouble?

75
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,710
Uncle is awake.

76
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,710
Uncle,

77
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Miss Min's room is ready.

78
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,190
Thank you, Young Mr. Qin.

79
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,000
Thanks, Young Mr. Qin.

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,750
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,430
It's insincere to come empty-handed.

82
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
Oh, by the way,

83
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,110
Mr. Chang,

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
put more plants

85
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,480
in Miss Min's room.

86
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,630
I'll help you choose them.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,730
Sorry.

88
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,070
I was busy with luggage today.

89
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,200
I'll make it up another day.

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Which day is "another day"?

91
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,470
Tomorrow.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Sure, I want fruit porridge.

93
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,270
Okay.

94
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,360
Add more grapes.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,480
The kind that helps with hangovers.

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Deal.

97
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Hello, Miss Feng.

98
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,430
A young lady before marriage

99
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,950
living in a men-only house.

100
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,720
I thought you'd refuse.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,830
I didn't expect you to move so fast.

102
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,830
Better to avoid any delays.

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,310
I don't want any more plotting.

104
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,110
Zhan,

105
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,480
you drank so much on an empty stomach.

106
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,920
I was really worried.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
I made porridge for you at dawn.

108
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,160
- Try some.
- Take it away.

109
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,630
I just want something light now,

110
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,150
like

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,600
grape porridge.

112
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,800
Grape porridge?

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,510
I'll bring some next time.

114
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,470
No need.

115
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,240
Someone makes it for me.

116
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,830
I thought Miss Min

117
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,600
were just Jiading's teacher.

118
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,040
I didn't expect you'd do all the chores.

119
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,390
She only makes it for me.

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,830
(Here we go again.)

121
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,800
(Even a scapegoat's life matters.)

122
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,040
It's just a small favor.

123
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,910
Where is my uncle?

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
Not in the room?

125
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Not here.

126
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,590
Uncle's...

127
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,750
(Uncle was with Miss Min last night.)

128
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,390
(So this lipstick mark
must be Miss Min's.)

129
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,870
(I've caught it.)

130
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,240
Young Master.

131
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
Tomorrow is your 25th birthday.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
How do you want to celebrate?

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,040
Mr. Chang will handle it, no worries.

134
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,390
When have I not cared

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,390
about your birthday?

136
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,350
This time…

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,270
Uncle,

138
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,000
guess what I found?

139
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,920
Did you secretly find me an aunt?

140
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,590
Zhan.

141
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,430
Jiading,

142
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,750
I accidentally left this last night.

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,560
(Wasn't Uncle with you yesterday?)

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
(See?)

145
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,000
(The one involved with your uncle)

146
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,870
(isn't me.)

147
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,960
Last night your tutor

148
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,240
accidentally upset Jiang.

149
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,390
If not for your uncle's help,

150
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,150
you'd be looking for a new tutor.

151
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,790
Miss Min, how do you know Jiang Dong?

152
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,790
There's a reason behind it.

153
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,390
It's Jiang Dong's doing,
not Min Jiangxi's fault.

154
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,240
When did Jiang Dong ever manipulate you?

155
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,750
You drank so much

156
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,360
to save her.

157
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,630
But some people

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,480
just walked away

159
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,270
after that.

160
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,630
If I hadn't taken care of
your uncle yesterday,

161
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,200
he must be feeling awful.

162
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,200
I thought you were waiting to

163
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,790
take care of Mr. Qin.

164
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,630
I could only help.

165
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,320
Zhan,

166
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,910
let me help you wash that.

167
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,360
Why are you doing

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
the servants' work?

169
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,870
No need to wash it.

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,630
- Throw it away.
- Okay.

171
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,200
I'll throw it out for you.

172
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,510
I won't let this show up here anymore.

173
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,270
Jiading, please slow down.

174
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Miss Min,

175
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,200
Mr. Lu Yuchi is outside looking for you.

176
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
Alright.

177
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,790
You two take your time.

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't forget my grape porridge.

179
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,650
I haven't eaten since last night

180
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,630
because of you.

181
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,110
Okay.

182
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Zhan,

183
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,910
why were you so harsh

184
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,360
to me?

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,870
I have a clear reputation.

186
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,240
How can those attention-seekers

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,320
compare to me?

188
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,390
Why am I seen as bad?

189
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,600
You tried hard to get
Min Jiangxi involved.

190
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,790
But only you know your true intentions.

191
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
But I've helped her many times.

192
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Although there were some minor issues,

193
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,630
they were unintentional mistakes.

194
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,840
How can you side with her against me?

195
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,550
I've tolerated you for too long.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,550
Stop using your pitiful

197
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,630
acting skills on me.

198
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,790
Mr. Qin, I want to
take a day off tomorrow.

199
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,790
I need to meet a Chamber of Commerce
President with Lu Yuchi.

200
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,120
I'll make up Jiading's class later.

201
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,390
Go ahead.

202
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,240
Thanks.

203
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,390
Your friend

204
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,790
sure knows how to use your strengths.

205
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,120
When dealing with men,

206
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,510
having you along is always wise.

207
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,320
Mutual benefit is the key
to partnership.

208
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,390
Miss Feng is so successful.

209
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,510
Do people often say

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
that you rely on

211
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,600
your charm?

212
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,960
Are you going to

213
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,870
rule Shencheng in the future?

214
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,750
Our family never needs to endure

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,670
in Shencheng.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
Mr. Chang,

217
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
inform Qian

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
to escort Miss Min tomorrow.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
Yes.

220
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,150
Qian is my driver.

221
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,790
He'll be waiting for you outside.

222
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,510
No matter what happens tomorrow,

223
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,790
you can reach out to him.

224
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,480
There's no need to bother.

225
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,390
It's no trouble.

226
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,600
He'll be on standby the whole time,

227
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,870
just like yesterday.

228
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,750
(Is he trying to say)

229
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,030
(nothing happened with
Feng Jingyun last night?)

230
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,600
(Is he proving his innocence?)

231
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,870
(To me?)

232
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,360
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

233
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,630
No worries.

234
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,150
Zhan is kind-hearted.

235
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,030
But don't get too full of yourself.

236
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,320
Do you plan to just

237
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,720
take it when he offers?

238
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,600
What are you implying?

239
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,960
Qian is your driver.

240
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,440
Everyone in Shencheng knows him.

241
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,120
You asked him to pick up Min Jiangxi.

242
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,600
People will think

243
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,510
she has something to do
with the Qin Family.

244
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,790
I'm considering Miss Min's reputation.

245
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,960
I'll see who dares to question

246
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
the decision I made.

247
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,900
