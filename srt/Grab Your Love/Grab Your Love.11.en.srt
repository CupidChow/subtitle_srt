9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,790
Why is breakfast so good today?

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,200
Is someone ill?

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
Miss Min,

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,350
it's time to eat.

13
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,710
I'm not hungry, you go ahead.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,070
Miss Min looks unwell.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
This porridge is for her, right?

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Hmm.

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,270
Did you

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,510
have a fight?

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,350
I couldn't get close to her

20
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,680
under Qin Zhan's watch.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,120
And you were thinking about her?

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,310
I didn't intend to do
anything to Miss Min.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
I…

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,400
I was trying to help you.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,760
After today,

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,120
your boss will be the
laughingstock of Shencheng.

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,870
Tonight is full of Shencheng's elites.

28
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,280
Your boss came to attend a rival's

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,150
birthday party for a woman.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,710
But she doesn't even want to show up.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Do you think

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,120
Jiang Dong's reputation is ruined?

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,750
Some women

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,190
are just destined for hardship.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,150
Only when they're with a man

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
do they feel secure.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,680
There are many beauties tonight.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,750
It's a rare evening.

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,910
Enjoy the night.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,710
(I can't let the boss
lose face in front of Qin.)

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
(It's just a woman.)

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm afraid you'll lose face
at Qin's place,

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
so I just

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
used some medicine.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,910
You drugged Min Jiangxi

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
in Qin's house.

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,910
Do you think he won't
trace it back to me?

48
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,590
It's like putting my face

49
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,900
on the ground for him to step on.

50
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,270
I can

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
confess to him.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
I take full responsibility.

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
Stop right there.

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,950
Do you want me to clean up your mess

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,750
if you go to Qin's house now?

56
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,120
Think it through.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Qin is as ruthless as a wolf.

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
He's not called Shencheng's
worst for nothing.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,910
No. So…

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Let's go.

61
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,520
See if I can save your life.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
The person who drugged her is here.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
What's your plan for him?

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,920
You dared to mess with my place,

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
but you don't have the nerve,

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,560
so you grabbed a scapegoat to fool me.

67
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,470
No.

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,190
I acted on my own.

69
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,600
Dong knew nothing about it.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Shut up!

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,750
I always take responsibility.

72
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,120
I'd rather lose everything,

73
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,430
than let someone else take the blame.

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,720
It's related to Min Jiangxi.

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
Do you think I can't see

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,390
who he risked everything for?

77
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,450
Let's be straightforward.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,190
How do you want to handle him?

79
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
Kill him.

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
Qiu Jie made mistakes.

81
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,190
But it's not worth dying for.

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,750
If he doesn't die,

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,750
you won't leave here either.

84
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,390
Put the gun down.

85
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,470
Drop it!

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,830
I'll die.

87
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,590
Qin,

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,350
Qiu Jie has been with me
since childhood.

89
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,160
This time, he got into trouble

90
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,560
for my sake.

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,480
I have never begged anyone.

92
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Dong.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,510
Don't you want to make herbal medicine?

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,870
Save my brother's life,

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,720
and I'll pull out all Jiang's
shops in the east

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,750
and clear the way for you.

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Your master has spent

98
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,310
a lot to protect you.

99
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,510
But while you can avoid death,
punishment is inevitable.

100
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,560
I don't want others to know about this.

101
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,510
Watch your mouth.

102
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,790
Dong.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,390
(I can't believe Min Jiangxi is)

104
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,600
(so important in Qin's mind.)

105
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,150
Dong,

106
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,600
thank you for protecting me.

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,400
You can leave.

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
Considering you have reasons

109
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,510
and served me loyally for years,

110
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,270
I'll give you enough pension.

111
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
I understand.

112
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,720
Thank you, Dong.

113
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm setting a new rule.

114
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,950
I won't use low tactics

115
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,120
to get Min Jiangxi.

116
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,310
If anyone acts clever again

117
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,310
and use such despicable means on her,

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
you can leave me!

119
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,230
Understood.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
The drugging was done
by Jiang Dong's people.

121
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,320
They've admitted it.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,950
If you don't believe me,

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,790
you can ask him.

124
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,320
Dong, the wine is here.

125
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,200
What did you put in the wine?

126
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,750
Go to the hospital or should I help you?

127
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,270
(I wronged Qin Zhan, yet he helped me.)

128
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,510
(I should apologize to him.)

129
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,510
Miss Min, you're just in time.

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Young Master is sick, please help me.

131
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,550
I just gave him the medicine.

132
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,870
He refused it.

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,270
(The uncle and the nephew
both refused medicine.)

134
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,510
(It's a family trait.)

135
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,510
Mr. Chang, do you have preserved fruits?

136
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,510
Yes, follow me.

137
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,720
This family needs

138
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,560
a careful woman.

139
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,390
Mr. Qin.

140
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,510
Mr. Qin.

141
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
(So hot.)

142
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,750
You can't keep holding on like this.

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll go find a doctor.

144
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,480
No doctor.

145
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,360
Then at least take your medicine.

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
Let me help you.

147
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Come on.

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
So cold.

149
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,120
Mr. Qin,

150
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm Min Jiangxi, not Jiading.

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,870
It's improper to hold me like this.

152
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,230
Mr. Qin.

153
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,670
Mr. Qin.

154
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,080
What are you two doing?

155
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,080
Jiading, you're just in time.

156
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
Mr. Qin has a fever and is confused.

157
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,080
Help me control him.

158
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll give him some medicine.

159
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
Hurry up.

160
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Qin, let go.

161
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,270
Miss Min, I'm still growing.

162
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,350
I can't afford to get sick.

163
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,670
I trust you to take care of him.

164
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,430
- I'm leaving, goodbye.
- Jiading.

165
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,550
Jiading, where's your filial piety?

166
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,480
Uncle is finally on the right track.

167
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,670
He's even pulling the sympathy card.

168
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,120
Mr. Qin, I can hold off
calling the doctor,

169
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,270
but can you please take your medicine?

170
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,510
Your hair

171
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
smells so good.

172
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,390
This smells better.

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,720
Let me help you.

174
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,790
I added some preserved fruits,

175
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,550
but not much, to preserve the effect.

176
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
Are you okay?

177
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,630
It's so bitter.

178
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,630
Mr. Qin,

179
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,390
drink all this first.

180
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,080
I'll buy Magic Grapes
to ease the bitterness.

181
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,960
Really?

182
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,960
(You do care about me.)

183
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,030
Mr. Qin,

184
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
the way you look now

185
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,550
is even more magical than Magic Grapes.

186
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
You're all sweaty.

187
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,150
I'll ask Mr. Chang to help wipe it off.

188
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,800
You do it.

189
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,910
We should keep distance.
