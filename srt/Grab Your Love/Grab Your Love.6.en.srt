143
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,630

144
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,650

This place belongs to the Jiang family.

155

So I'm rightfully here.

156
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,480
I heard you're entering
the pharma business.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
What kind are you dealing in?

158
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,200
You look dissatisfied.

159
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,720
Is it for treating your body?

160
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,590
Get lost.

161
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,630

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
Get lost.

163
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,320
Qin, I'll say it again.

164
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
This is my turf.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,910
You're not the boss here.

166
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,200
Did you swap directing
for selling goods?

167
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,510
These are not for sale.

168
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,200
They're specially for you.

169
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,510
Inside here

170
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,080
are two hidden plans.

171
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,360
But it's up to you

172
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,630
to decide which to use.

173
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,350
Me?

174
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,510
As the saying goes, women succeed

175
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
through persistence,
men through persuasion.

176
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,440
If you think he's decent,

177
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,360
play to your strengths

178
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,670
and turn him into your husband.

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,560
Stop right there.

180
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,200
That's impossible. Next.

181
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,390
Then activate Plan B.

182
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,030
A concealed weapon, ready to use.

183
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,030
Can this be used for protection?

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,910
Even you can't see its secret.

185
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,630
It's a pepper spray perfume.

186
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
Very fitting for you.

187
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,270
If he tries something,

188
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,630
just spray him.

189
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
Are you protecting me or setting me up?

190
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,200
His guys would tear me apart

191
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,080
before I used this to him.

192
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,510
I can't

193
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,440
be there to protect you.

194
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,120
So I'm worried.

195
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
You suggested I move into their family,

196
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,790
but also warned me about them.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
The Qin family has two troublemakers.

198
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,510
People are unpredictable,
you have to be cautious.

199
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,670
So

200
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,670
I'm going to

201
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,750
live under someone else's roof

202
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,910
and live on the edge.

203
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
Stop it.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,750
You're both beautiful and smart.

205
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,030
You have both looks and brains.

206
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,670
What man would put you in danger?

207
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,030
I appreciate it.

208
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,840
But as for me,

209
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,240
I'll be the only one

210
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,030
left in this house.

211
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,390
As a delicate gentleman like me,

212
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,200
I need protection.

213
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,790
You're disgusting.

214
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,080
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

215
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,480
She's still here?

216
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,840
Miss Feng has had several bottles.

217
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,390
Will she be okay?

218
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,600
Keep a close watch.

219
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,120
She can afford it.

220
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,670
Just don't let her drink to death here.

221
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
Min Jiangxi.

222
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,840
Zhan is just temporarily
enchanted by you.

223
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,150
He'll realize who loves him the most

224
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,480
sooner or later.

225
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,030
You act innocent when you see a man.

226
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,670
Let's see if your acting is better,

227
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,030
or if my truth-revealing
mirror is sharper.

228
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,060
