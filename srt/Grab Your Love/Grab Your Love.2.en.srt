9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,110
I heard you got into a fight.

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,390
Are you hurt anywhere?
Let me take a look.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,710
Zhan.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
Zhan, I heard you got into a fight

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,750
with the herbal supplier

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,350
my dad introduced to you for a bar girl.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,840
Won't it be harder for you to do

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,710
Traditional Chinese Medicine business?

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,710
That's the rumor?

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,990
(Apology Notice)
Your dad's connections are pricey,

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,350
I can't afford them.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,640
She's the Maritime Bureau
Director's daughter.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Our families have been close
for generations.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,640
I didn't ask you.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,350
Since you work for my family,

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,200
you'll deal with her.

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,560
So I'm giving you a heads-up.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
She's arrogant and jealous,

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,200
always clinging to him since childhood.

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,480
Any woman near him

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,000
will be dealt with by her.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,400
Just a friendly tip, you're welcome.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Thank you.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,590
Mutual consent matters

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,230
in business.

34
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,400
It's okay if this deal doesn't work out.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,130
Zhan,

36
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,280
what charm does that bar girl have?

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,150
Miss Feng,

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,870
that woman you mentioned is my tutor,

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
not a bar girl.

40
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,680
You're not well-informed.

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,350
Jiading.

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,510
Mr. Qin, today's class is over.

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,630
I'll take my leave now.

44
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,240
Stay for lunch.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,680
But I have other things to do.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,630
No matter what it is,

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,520
you can still stay for lunch.

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
(You're a family.)

49
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,910
(Why include me?)

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
Miss Feng is just visiting.

51
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,280
No need to be so formal.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
That's not the reason.

53
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,310
Young Master, lunch is ready.

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,030
Let's go.

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Come on.

56
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,030
Why does every dish have chili?

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,520
Zhan, don't you prefer sweet?

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,590
Miss Min is from Yecheng.

59
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
She likes spicy food.

60
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,520
I asked Mr. Chang to make it.

61
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
No wonder.

62
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,470
Zhan doesn't usually

63
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,870
have greasy dishes.

64
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,910
People do change.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,630
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

66
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,910
And thanks to Mr. Chang too.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Delicious.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,900
How's the class going?

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm very pleased with Miss Min.

70
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,560
No wonder you like her

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,310
and request her to tutor me.

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,430
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,310
(What's going on?)

74
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,310
(I won't let her)

75
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,590
(take him away.)

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,310
I could guess your profession

77
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,150
by your looking.

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,280
But I never expected

79
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,560
that you're a tutor.

80
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,310
My father made a living by teaching.

81
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,840
I've been influenced since childhood.

82
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,120
Teaching is my faith.

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,710
It's also my survival skill.

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
The Qin family loves beauty.

85
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,310
Whether choosing a tutor,

86
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,520
or selecting a wife,

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,240
it's a basic standard.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Right?

89
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Agreed.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,040
A pretty face isn't enough

91
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,310
to work long for the Qin family.

92
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,310
You need real skills too.

93
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,040
I won't let Mr. Qin down.

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,720
Let's not talk business over lunch.

95
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Try this.

96
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,160
See if you like it.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,960
It's good.

98
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,270
I can do it myself.

99
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,720
Can you see it?

100
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,270
(They're using me to fend off trouble.)

101
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm full. I'm heading out.

102
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,710
Wait.

103
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,910
Mr. Chang.

104
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,360
Miss Min, here's your salary.

105
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,270
This is much more than agreed.

106
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,310
I can't accept this.

107
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,750
I'm very pleased with your work.

108
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,560
You deserve it.

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,190
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,440
Goodbye.

111
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,870
I'll see Miss Min off.

112
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
See you tomorrow.

113
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,120
See you tomorrow.

114
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,800
(It's so spicy.)

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
Miss Min,

116
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,430
don't think you can do something else

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
just because Zhan is satisfied with you.

118
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,270
Rushing into danger isn't wise.

119
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,630
I take my job seriously,

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
because teaching is my passion.

121
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,240
It has nothing to do with your crush.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,270
Miss Min, don't get it wrong.

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,510
I'm close to Zhan.

124
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,270
It's my duty to

125
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,270
clear out bad influences for him.

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,950
Being labeled a bad influence is harsh.

127
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,510
If you insist on labeling me,

128
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,510
I won't just take it.

129
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,120
Are you threatening me?

130
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,720
Not a threat, just showing our cards.

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,390
My trump card is

132
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,720
only I can teach Qin Jiading.

133
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,160
With Mr. Qin's regard for him,

134
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,680
he won't let others mistreat me.

135
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,680
You know Zhan well?

136
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,160
I just understand his hopes for his son.

137
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,510
I only do business with Mr. Qin.

138
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,270
Miss Feng, no need to
be overly cautious.

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,830
(Short-sighted.)

140
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,160
(She works by my side,)

141
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,510
(but only thinks about money.)

142
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,560
That nuisance finally met her match.

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,190
Miss Min is impressive.

144
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,160
I heard your friend is making a movie.

145
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,070
(She's done her work.)

146
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,870
(She's not easy to deal with.)

147
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,480
This is our first meeting,

148
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,120
yet you know so much about me.

149
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,950
I'm quite flattered.

150
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,750
I need to know everything

151
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,480
about people around Zhan.

152
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,870
There's a celebration banquet tomorrow

153
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,390
for the film I'm starring in.

154
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,390
All the big names will be there.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,510
I can introduce you to them.

156
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,220
(Invitation)
(Refusing means declaring war.)

157
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,950
(I'll give each other a way out.)

158
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,620
(Invitation)

159
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,450
Then I'll thank you
on behalf of my friend.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,750
Thank you, Miss Feng.

161
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,030
See you tomorrow.

162
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
I must check the almanac

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,790
next time I come here.

164
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,250
(Celebration banquet; Happy Event;
Box office success; Double happiness)

165
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,750
Wonderful!

166
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,360
A big mess, huh?

167
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,630
It's a great day.

168
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,510
Yes, indeed.

169
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,670
The film The Happy Event is such a hit.

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,870
May I ask about the happy event

171
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,390
of you and Mr. Qin?

172
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,270
It's still early, don't rush it.

173
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,630
A good match is worth waiting for.

174
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,720
After all, no one else can match Mr. Qin

175
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,510
except you.

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Indeed.

177
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,790
Let me introduce myself.

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm Zhou Yang.

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Half of Shencheng's

180
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,050
underground bank is run by my family.

181
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,630
It won't be a problem for me to invest

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,920
money to make a film.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let me explain to you then.

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,910
Our story is about a wealthy lady

185
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,750
falling in love with a humble performer.

186
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Later, they become separated by fate

187
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
due to societal pressure.

188
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,390
If Miss Min plays the lead role,

189
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll dedicate myself to the art.

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,670
Add some intimate scenes for us.

191
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,600
Miss Min's figure is stunning.

192
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,030
A little exposure

193
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,200
would make the theaters packed.

194
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,390
Sorry, Mr. Zhou,

195
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,790
I'm making a film,

196
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,910
not catering to your whims.

197
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,250
Aren't you trading charm for cash

198
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,720
with a girl here?

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,990
Why the pretentious act?

200
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,630
You're swayed by desire,

201
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,950
always thinking of shady deals.

202
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,630
She smiled at me.

203
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,600
She was leading me on.

204
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,390
Miss Min is my esteemed guest.

205
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,870
Mind your words.

206
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,000
I was just joking with her.

207
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,150
I didn't do anything to her.

208
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,990
Get lost.

209
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,000
These people

210
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,910
are used to nightlife spots.

211
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,550
They're always drawn to flashy people.

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,390
Miss Min, don't take it to heart.

213
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,550
Thank you, Miss Feng.

214
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Suit yourselves.

215
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,320
I'll go greet the guests.

216
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,000
What does "flashy" even mean?

217
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,670
- Watch her words.
- Alright.

218
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't argue with them.

219
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's go over there.

220
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,120
Let's enjoy the free lunch

221
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,790
and make the trip worth it.

222
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,740
(Celebration banquet; Happy Event;
Box office success; Double happiness)

223
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,000
The villain.

224
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,800
Zhan.

225
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm so thrilled you came.

226
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,600
Director Feng sent the invitation.

227
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Of course, I had to come.

228
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,350
Congratulations to you.

229
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,550
Thank you.

230
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,120
I like it.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,870
Mr. Qin cares about Miss Feng.

232
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,550
Could it be something good is coming?

233
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,030
Then why is he taking sunflowers

234
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,030
instead of roses?

235
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,000
You have a point.

236
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,280
Go ahead with your work.

237
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,550
I'll just sit for a while.

238
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,800
Alright.

239
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,550
I have a solution.

240
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,120
Mr. Qin, what a coincidence!

241
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,000
You're here too.

242
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,750
What's going on?

243
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,120
Do they know each other?

244
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,510
Do you have a side job in film?

245
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
My friend is a director.

246
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm here to learn from seniors.

247
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,870
Mr. Qin.

248
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,200
Nice to meet you.

249
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,510
You gave me a great chance.

250
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,550
I haven't thanked you yet.

251
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,120
They have something going on.

252
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,240
How do you plan to thank me?

253
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,480
I know what you value most.

254
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,000
There's plenty of time ahead.

255
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,390
I'll repay you with my actions.

256
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
I didn't expect

257
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,960
it turns out Miss Min and Mr. Qin

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,120
are familiar with each other.

259
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,790
I was just talking about making a movie

260
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,390
with Miss Min.

261
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,080
It's an honor

262
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,550
to meet with you, Mr. Qin.

263
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,790
Shall we have a drink?

264
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Remember tomorrow,

265
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,360
be punctual.

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,080
See you tomorrow, Mr. Qin.

267
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,840
Miss Min, what movie
were you talking about?

268
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,910
I'm also keen on investing.

269
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,550
My friend is the director.

270
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,240
Discuss the details with him.

271
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,390
I'm stepping out for fresh air.
Seize the moment.

272
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,390
Feel free to read my script.

273
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,260
Alright.

274
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,070
Miss Min and Mr. Qin have

275
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,910
something going on.

276
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,150
Could she be Mr. Qin's…

277
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,960
Stop.

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,080
Let's go.
