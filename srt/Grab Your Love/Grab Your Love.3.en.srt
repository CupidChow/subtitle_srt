9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,710
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,230
Haven't you already left?

11
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,640
If I left,

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,710
I'd miss the great show.

13
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,680
There are so many stars here.

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,640
Why are you so interested in my play?

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,870
You're the boldest one.

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,710
You even dared to use me.

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,480
You didn't expose me,

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,150
which means you're not angry.

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,070
So why did you come here

20
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,350
to hold me accountable?

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,920
You dare to guess my thoughts?

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,350
It's much easier for you
to see through me

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,950
than the other way around.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,510
I wouldn't dare guess your thoughts.

25
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,710
Sharp-tongued.

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,560
Thanks for the compliment.

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,400
I won't disturb you.

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,630
See you tomorrow.

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,270
Zhan,

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,630
I thought I couldn't catch up with you.

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,080
Were you waiting for me here?

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,750
A little fox blocked my way.

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,990
I was about to leave.

34
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,910
Which fox can be
smarter than Min Jiangxi?

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,710
She used you to
connect with the big shots.

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,470
Well.

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,840
Now you can't cut ties with her.

38
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,990
I don't need you to

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,150
judge my people.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,150
Qin Jiading.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,190
Qin Jiading, are you still in bed?

42
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm coming in.

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,400
Still not up?

44
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,800
If you don't get up soon,

45
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,840
the sun will

46
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,520
toast your back.

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
Jiading,

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,150
I'm going to pull the covers.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,470
Three,

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
two,

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,470
one.

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
Mr. Qin.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
Why are you here?

54
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,230
Miss Min.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
We can't

56
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,600
handle your methods.

57
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,680
I didn't.

58
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,120
Does it feel good?

59
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,600
You haven't answered me.

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
Does it feel good?

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,270
Still craving for more, huh?

62
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I didn't.

63
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Get up.

64
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,560
It's class time.

65
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,720
I thought you were Jiading.

66
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
And it...

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
It was a misunderstanding.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Miss Min kissed you?

69
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm telling grandpa about this.

70
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,950
It's not true.

71
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,310
It's true.

72
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,270
I'm being honest.

73
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,110
Stop messing around.

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Mr. Qin, why are you here?

75
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,430
He had a fever and refused medicine.

76
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,750
I came to take care of him.

77
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,830
You looked after him?

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,750
He felt too hot to sleep in bed.

79
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,600
Yeah, I sleep on the floor
when I have a fever.

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,720
You tough it out every time you're sick?

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,120
The medicine tastes awful.

82
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,510
I'd rather endure it.

83
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,680
(He's a good father though.)

84
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,360
(But he's too lenient with the kid.)

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Take your time packing.

86
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
I'll be right back.

87
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,310
Where is she going?

88
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
Stay calm.

89
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Fruit porridge.

90
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,800
Why didn't I think of that?

91
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,220
Give me the medicine.

92
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,720
Thank you, Miss Min.

93
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,570
No problem.

94
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,940
You dare drug him in front of me?

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,990
It's for fever reduction.

96
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,750
Jiading refused to take medicine, maybe

97
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,680
hating the bitterness.

98
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
This should work.

99
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,560
You stayed with Jiading all night.

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,650
How about having some too?

101
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,800
Just in case.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,870
Give it to me.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,950
A bowl without medicine.

104
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,270
Here you go.

105
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,910
Here you go.

106
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
Is this hush money?

107
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,870
It's a pre-class treat.

108
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,630
And this.

109
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,030
Yecheng delicacies.

110
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,910
I bet you've never had it.

111
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,560
Good.

112
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,150
Your family cares about you.

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,000
They sent treats from so far away.

114
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,120
I have no family.

115
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,630
It's from my friend's parents.

116
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,960
Did you fall for that guy

117
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,750
just because of that kiss?

118
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,960
Of course not.

119
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
Also,

120
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,240
you keep saying "that guy".

121
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,390
He cares about you so much.

122
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,510
This would break his heart.

123
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,080
I didn't insult him,

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,150
so why would he be upset?

125
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,320
You always call him Mr. Qin,

126
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,120
seeming so respectful.

127
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
But you just kissed him.

128
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,120
I told you, it was an accident.

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,510
It better be an accident,

130
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,600
or Miss Feng would be jealous.

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,550
She could crush you.

132
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,120
Even the best doctor couldn't save you.

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,030
Jiading,

134
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
rest assured.

135
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
I just want to be a strict tutor,

136
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,480
and help you succeed.

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,870
Whoever dates you will be annoyed.

138
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Thank you.

139
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,150
As a return gift,

140
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,510
please finish this whole book.

141
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,120
I'll check in an hour.

142
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,510
The porridge is amazing.

143
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,270
My headache's gone.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,750
Really?

145
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,960
Then it's perfect for studying.

146
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,750
I feel full of energy.

147
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,750
Shall we switch to an outdoor class?

148
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Mr. Qin!

149
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,750
I'll do it.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Women can be quite intense.

151
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
You can just call for help.

152
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,150
People who read a lot have ideas.

153
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,840
Why didn't I think of

154
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,150
putting the medicine in the dessert?

155
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Give me another one.

156
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,080
This is your last.

157
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,030
Unless I...

158
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,480
Give you mine?

159
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,790
Save it yourself.

160
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,720
I just want to treat her to a meal.

161
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,480
I could have come alone.

162
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,080
You don't have to drop me off.

163
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,510
Are you…

164
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,390
trying to get a free meal?

165
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,910
You could've called her.

166
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,870
Why come in person?

167
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,550
It shows my sincerity.

168
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,510
She's the first to dare to drug me.

169
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,510
But she did cure me.

170
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
A true gentleman

171
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,480
should repay the kindness.

172
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,670
The way you speak

173
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,690
sounds more like revenge.

174
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,670
You'd better let her
give you more lessons.

175
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,870
It's fine

176
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,030
as long as she teaches me.

177
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
Hurry up.

178
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,750
You'd miss dinner.

179
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
Jiading?

180
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,240
Things have been unstable lately.

181
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,750
You opened the door without asking.

182
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,750
Do you know how dangerous it is?

183
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,550
Thanks for the advice.

184
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
But

185
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,240
why are you here?

186
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,910
Does Mr. Qin know you left alone?

187
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,200
Mr. Qin brought me here.

188
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,480
He's waiting downstairs.

189
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,870
You ask about him as soon as I'm here.

190
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
Are you

191
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,320
interested in him?

192
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,150
Okay, I'll keep quiet.

193
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
I shouldn't worry

194
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,680
that your family will be concerned

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,270
about you going out at night.

196
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,840
I'll be an adult in two years.

197
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
So, young Master Qin,

198
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,510
what brings you here?

199
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,270
Mr. Chang told me about you

200
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,110
drugging me.

201
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,280
As a token of gratitude,

202
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,670
I'm inviting you to dinner.

203
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,360
It's just a bowl of porridge.

204
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
No need for thanks.

205
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,870
You don't have to be so formal.

206
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,910
Then tell that to the person downstairs.

207
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,480
Mr. Qin wants to treat me?

208
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,320
I'm inviting you,

209
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,400
but he's covering the bill.

210
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,960
Alright, let me change clothes.

211
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,750
Could it be Mr. Qin?

212
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,440
Zhou Yang?

213
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,390
You woman.

214
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,080
You think I can't find you

215
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,440
without giving me an address?

216
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,910
What are you going to do?

217
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,870
(Her boyfriend?)

218
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
I want you!

219
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,000
- Let go of me!
- I am not letting you go today!

220
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,280
Who are you?

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,910
I haven't asked who you are.

222
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,630
I'll show you who I am.

223
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,750
Jiading.

224
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,200
Zhou Yang, let him go.

225
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
You even choose him over me.

226
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,030
You woman.

227
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,960
Don't come closer.

228
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,590
Get away.

229
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,580
