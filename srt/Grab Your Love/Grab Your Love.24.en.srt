Zhan, save me.

Min Jiangxi.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,710
Why are you two together?

14
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,480
Didn't you promise to marry me?

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,760
I never said I'd marry you.

16

The only person I want to marry

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,120
is Min Jiangxi.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Alright.

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,150
Qin makes a good point.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840
Let's follow his advice…

24
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,550
Mr. Chang,

25
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,710
bring in some refreshments.

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,270
Mr. Chang,

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,310
did anyone come in earlier?

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,950
Driver Qian

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,920
said he'd bring something in.

30
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,070
Didn't he come over?

31
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,630
Got it.

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,480
I'll get back to work.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,840
Feng Jingyun has

34
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,470
a long reach in this.

35
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,360
A spy?

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,910
I'll bring him back

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,280
- and torture him.
- Wait.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,030
Since the messenger came to us,

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,750
why not turn him to our side?

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,120
This painting stays with the mastermind.

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
So once we find the painting,

42
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,310
the real culprit will be revealed.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,920
So

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,030
we need to stage a show

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,470
for the culprit.

46
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,430
Qin Zhan, if you're tired of me,

47
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,520
just let me go.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,310
Pack Min Jiangxi's bags and

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,520
have her leave this place.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,640
It's perfect timing.

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,910
Figure out where I should

52
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,280
put this dowry.

53
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,680
I'd like to see

54
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,910
how grand the Feng Family is

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,840
that even Shencheng's
richest man loves it.

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,870
Min Jiangxi.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
Are you Min Huai's daughter?

58
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,310
You criminal.

59
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,820
You don't deserve to mention my dad.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,870
If he had just given me the painting,

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
how could he have died?

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,430
Stop making excuses for your crimes.

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Justice always prevails.

64
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,710
I finally found the real culprit.

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,870
I will avenge my father

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
and you will atone for your sins.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,080
If I let a little girl like you

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,310
accuse me without proof,

69
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,100
I'd be a career suicide
for me in Shencheng.

70
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,470
Is that so?

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Chief Chen, I can explain.

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,080
The fire was set by Lin Guangyao.

73
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,710
He also gave me the painting.

74
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,910
I had no idea.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,240
I heard everything you said.

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,910
Lying now will worsen your case.

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
Feng Yuanzhang,

78
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
your good days are over.

79
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,430
You!

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,030
You!

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,480
You set me up.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
Dad.

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Dad.

84
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,640
Dad.

85
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,310
Dad.

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,870
- Dad.
- What do you mean?

87
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,040
What are you doing?

88
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,910
What?

89
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,240
We saw you kill him.

90
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,510
It was self-defense.

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,680
Jiang Dong, we had an agreement.

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,240
I'd testify against Feng Yuanzhang.

93
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,270
And you'd clear my name.

94
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,480
You can't go back on your word.

95
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,830
You trafficked illegal drugs
and committed murder.

96
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,270
You even admitted to
dishonoring Miss Feng.

97
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,480
These are serious crimes.

98
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,630
Besides, when it comes to
right and wrong,

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,920
my moral boundaries adjust as needed.

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,870
When I needed you, I deceived you.

101
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,600
When I'm done with you, I handcuff you.

102
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,020
- Take care.
– You!

103
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Take him away.

104
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,120
You'll get what's coming!

105
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,390
You'll get what's coming!

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,560
Take Miss Feng home.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Don't be afraid.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
It's all over.

109
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Zhan,

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
thank you.

111
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,120
This guest is here for you.

192
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,870
Mr. Chu.

193
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,630
Miss Min.

194
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,320
You're in Shencheng too?

195
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,510
Let's go.

196
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,470
Together.

197
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,080
Mr. Chu, let me introduce someone.

198
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,670
This is my husband, Qin Zhan.

199
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,120
This is Mr. Chu,
who saved me from the fire.

200
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,000
That button belongs to Mr. Chu.

201
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,960
Mr. Chu.

202
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,630
Hello.

203
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,480
Hello, Mr. Qin.

204
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,390
I'm Chu Jinxing, Commander
of the Third Army in Shencheng.

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,240
I've come this time

206
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,720
to ask Mr. Qin for a favor.

207
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,160
With foreign invasion,

208
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,510
I'm currently raising military funds

209
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,480
from Chambers of Commerce
and Charitable Enterprises.

210
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,710
But

211
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,390
it's about finding investors after all.

212
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,910
We need someone with authority

213
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,030
to help persuade others.

214
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Would you be interested?

215
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,600
How much funding is needed?

216
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,630
Twenty million yuan.

217
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
Indeed,

218
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,000
it's a big ask.

219
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,300
(Shencheng Commercial Bank)

220
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,850
In times of crisis, everyone has a duty.

221
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Mr. Chu.

222
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,960
The Qin Family currently has

223
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,320
only 17 million available.

224
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,080
Take this 1.5 million first.

225
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,670
I'll figure out the rest.

226
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,580
(Shencheng Commercial Bank)

227
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,120
Why didn't anyone ask me?

228
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,120
After all, I'm Shencheng's
second richest man.

229
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,910
I can manage this.

230
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,670
Mr. Jiang, you're generous.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,850
I want to join Uncle Chu
and save the country.

232
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,950
Have you thought this through?

233
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,200
I've read so many books with Auntie

234
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,790
and gained so much knowledge.

235
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,510
Finally, it's useful.

236
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,990
I'm going too.

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,440
If I can handle a camera,
I can handle a cannon.

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,290
