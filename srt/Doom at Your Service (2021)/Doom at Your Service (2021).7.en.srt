159
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,340
As you know.

160
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,900
Stop!

161
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,750
It seemed like you were lost and wandering about.

- Are you done being angry?
- You...

166
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,020
Do you get a feel for it now? What you did to that child?

167
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,220
You want to disappear after receiving her love?

168
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,260
So you want to receive love...

169
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,730
from her, right?

170
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,280
You have big dreams.

171

I... I–

172
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,320
That day the tumor started to grow inside her brain,

173
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,890
you must've been doing something.

174
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,390
If you're done, leave.

175
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm done saying everything I wanted to say.

Where were you?

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,720
Did you run away?

192
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,630
I was chased out.

193
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,830
Chased?

194
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,430
By who? Where were you chased out to?

195
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,830
From your life to your life.

196
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,220
- Explain so I understand.
- I can't explain for you to understand.

197
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,200
You wouldn't understand anyway.

198
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,970
Hey!

199
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,120
I should be the one who is angry, but why are you angry instead?

200
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,370
I'm not angry at you.

201
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,320
Then why? Why are you mad at yourself?

202
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,550
Because I forgot everything. I'm angry about that.

203
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,290
I seriously can't understand you.

204
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,470
You have no intention of telling me, right?

205
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,430
I got it. I got it, so go to your house for now.

206
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,900
- I'm going right now.
- No.

207
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,470
Not through my house's front door, but through your house's front door.

208
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,410
Your house must have a front door.

209
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,890
When you disappeared,

210
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,130
I didn't even have a place I could go to find you.

211
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,970
Tell me. Your house.

212
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,590
That way, even if you're chased out again, I have somewhere to go find you.

213
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,790
Wow...

214
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,160
So this was a real place?

215
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,800
This is the front of my house.

216
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,820
Your house is located in a more accessible place than I thought.

217
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,840
I think I can find it next time.

218
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,730
You won't be able to find it.

219
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,370
If I am chased out again, even if you come here, you won't be able to see me.

220
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,760
What happened? You need to tell me so I–

221
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,170
I made a misjudgment.

222
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,160
It was a wrong conclusion.

223
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,150
What do you mean by that?

224
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,190
What you said was right.

225
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,920
You shouldn't love me.

226
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,970
You can't love me.

227
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,510
So, your wish...

228
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,630
I can't fulfill it.

229
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,550
It's cold. Let's go inside. Let's talk inside.

230
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,230
Asking me to love you, that's not possible.

231
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,540
Let's stop.

232
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,260
I am saying let's stop.

233
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
Living together.

234
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,010
What are you doing, Boss?

235
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,620
I wasn't doing anything.

236
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,320
- Boss.
- Yeah?

237
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,470
Are you suffering from unrequited love?

238
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,760
No.

239
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,170
Not unrequited love.

240
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,670
- First love.
- What?

241
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,580
- At your age, first love?
- When was your first love?

242
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,980
For me, maybe around age 18?

243
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,300
I was crazy in love.

244
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,310
I only have half of my heart, you know. Because I burned the other half then.

245
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,550
It was around then for me as well.

246
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,400
- But it's still ongoing?
- Yeah.

247
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
Because I ran into her again recently.

248
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,810
Awesome! How?

249
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,230
No, that's not the important thing.

250
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,600
How did you break up?

251
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,660
How we broke up is more important than the fact that we ran into each other again?

252
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,710
Of course, it's important.

253
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,150
I need to know that to get the answer.

254
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,570
The answer?

255
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,940
Whether it's possible or not.

256
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,380
How did you break up?

257
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,280
<i>Hyung, you do it for me.</i>

258
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,650
<i>I really don't think I can talk because I am so nervous, Hyung.</i>

259
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,510
<i>Teacher.</i>

260
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,090
<i>You always call me "teacher" only at times like this.</i>

261
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,230
<i>Why should I say it when you should be the one to do it? I don't want to.</i>

262
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,950
<i>I don't know what to say. What do I say?</i>

263
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,710
<i>Just say it, honestly.</i>

264
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,440
<i>How can I? I can never say something like that to her because it's so embarrassing.</i>

265
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,000
<i>This is all your fault!</i>

266
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,640
<i>Why am I at fault?</i>

267
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,690
<i>Because of you, I ate the rice cake you gave me and got indigestion and couldn't take the SAT. </i>

268
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,660
<i> This is all because... it ended up like that.</i>

269
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,130
<i>Without saying a word to your girlfriend, because you got upset with your friends teasing you,</i>

270
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,800
<i>you said that you are going to study abroad.</i>

271
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,190
<i>That isn't my fault.</i>

272
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,510
<i>I got pissed off when those bastards were talking about whether I can go to college or not,</i>

273
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,190
<i>and that I can't even go to a university for physical education after winning a medal as a high school freshman.</i>

274
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,900
<i>Ah, never mind. It's all your fault.</i>

275
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,830
<i>Hyung! Teacher!</i>

276
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,330
<i>Are you avoiding my call? Are you really going to Japan?</i>

277
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,940
<i>Where are you? Are you ignoring my text?</i>

278
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,030
<i>Sorry, I couldn't tell you in advance.</i>

279
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,910
<i>Let's meet and talk.</i>

280
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,860
<i>- Are you going to meet her?
- No.</i>

281
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,530
<i>For now, just get through the day safely. I will really take care of things later.</i>

282
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,360
<i>It's difficult to meet right now.</i>

283
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,800
<i>I will be arriving in ten minutes so come out.</i>

284
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,240
<i>Don't come over. I can't go out.</i>

285
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,420
<i>I am going to wait until you come out.</i>

286
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,530
<i>I said I can't go.</i>

287
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,750
<i>Why are you suddenly using spaces between words?</i>

288
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,270
<i>- Don't you use spaces between words?
- No. Why?</i>

289
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,060
<i>No way! Did she catch on?</i>

290
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,040
<i>You should have some grammar mistakes. Ah, seriously!</i>

291
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,430
<i>My tutoring you on Korean was in vain, I see.</i>

292
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,080
<i>I will call you later.</i>

293
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,120
<i>Are you breaking up with me?</i>

294
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,120
<i>If you don't respond, I will take that as we are breaking up.</i>

295
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,060
<i>From here on, you decide.</i>

296
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,210
<i>Bro.</i>

297
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,600
<i>Where are you going? Hyung!</i>

298
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,510
How did you respond?

299
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,780
I couldn't respond.

300
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,210
That's crazy. And you call yourself a man, human?

301
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,200
Really, I got hurt just now.

302
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,220
My heart shrunk to one-third its size. When it's only a half anyway.

303
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,110
Why in the world did you do that?

304
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,120
What do you mean "why"?

305
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,450
You must've had a reason, right?

306
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,150
I liked her...

307
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,970
so much.

308
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,100
That's why I was embarrassed about myself.

309
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,660
What's there to be embarrassed when you like each other?

310
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,370
There's something complicated like that when it comes to adults dating.

311
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,050
Adult, my foot. You were a high schooler back then.

312
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,820
I am more of an adult now than you were back then.

313
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,920
Is that so?

314
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,090
Then, when Mr. Part-timer, who is an adult, looks at it, is there an answer or not?

315
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,460
Ah, this is a little tough.

316
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,180
An older girl I know, once told me that she was also dumped via text.

317
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,610
It lasted for many years.

318
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,730
Every time she drinks, she says she will kill that bastard then she says she misses him.

319
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,930
He is probably dead by now.

320
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,770
If there's no answer, let's just go home.

321
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,250
It looks like there is no other way.

322
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,590
Your sad story...

323
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,720
moved my heart.

324
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,440
I will especially do it for you.

325
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,590
Dating counseling.

326
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,860
Hello. Who are you?

327
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,200
I think I should be the one to ask that.

328
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,630
Hyung, you're home.

329
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,100
This kid, he's the good-looking part-timer I told you about.

330
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,500
And this hyung is the one I told you—

331
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,310
Ah, I guess I never mentioned him. He's a hyung I live with.

332
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,000
You work at that company here, right? I've seen you a few times at the cafe.

333
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,620
Wow, you have a good memory. You memorized the customer's face already?

334
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,120
Am I right? Then you must be working at the same company as my older sister.

335
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,150
- Older sister?
- Older sister?

336
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,430
Do you know Tak Dong Kyeong? She's my sister.

337
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,110
- Your name is?
- It's Tak Seon Kyeong.

338
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,610
So, you are Tak Dong Kyeong's biological—

339
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,140
Yes. A biological younger sibling.

340
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,640
Woah, woah. Calm down, Hyung. Calm down.

341
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,030
I can take care of everything.

342
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,650
Just think what's done is done.

343
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,060
So...

344
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,140
We now have secrets between us or something like that, right, Hyung?

345
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,960
That's right, Little Bro.

346
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,790
Between brothers, what is important?

347
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,040
- Loyalty!
- Then, how do you stay loyal to this older brother?

348
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,770
Keeping secrets.

349
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,590
Hey, you picked the part-timer well. He's smart.

350
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,740
Of course. Look at him.

351
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,910
He looks very thoughtful and tight-lipped, doesn't he?

352
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,060
He's no joke, seriously.

353
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,470
I tend to act the way I look.

354
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,280
Right, you guys are acting foolish.

355
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,220
Even today,

356
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,440
he stayed after work to give me dating counseling.

357
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,760
Dating counseling?

358
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,190
I am... in that area... known—

359
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,560
Actually, on Jeju Island, I was big.

360
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,600
I can picture it.

361
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,560
While you walked down the school hallway,

362
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,350
the girls were glued to the window and screamed. Right?

363
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,630
It was the same for me, too.

364
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,140
- I went to a boys high school though.
- I see.

365
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,170
It was a boys high school?

366
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,560
So, to continue with what we were talking about...

367
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,330
To be honest, when it comes to love, all men are pretty much the same.

368
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,030
But it's not the same for women. This is what I am saying.

369
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,440
If, let's say if...

370
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,200
there are 1,000 women,

371
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,470
all 1,000 are different.

372
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,680
You have to conquer that which is uniquely hers.

373
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,500
So, what is that?

374
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,170
So...

375
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,940
What could it be?

376
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,960
Just pray.

377
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,160
- What?
- Pray that something good comes up.

378
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,560
How do you do that?

379
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,830
Ah, there's no answer to that.

380
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,280
So, I am asking you how do you do that?

381
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,670
This is why it's useless giving dating advice.

382
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,460
You need to be at a certain level to talk.

383
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,200
Right, Hyungnim?

384
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,430
This is bitter.

385
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,980
Dating or what, life isn't easy.

386
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,300
Why? Something giving you a hard time?

387
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
Who doesn't have a story?

388
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,200
What is it? Just tell this boss,

389
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,070
I mean, tell this Hyung everything.

390
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,930
Next time. I'll tell you when we're closer.

391
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,140
Our boss is a pushover.

392
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,710
I'm so sorry about you.

393
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,750
Even today's story about your first love,

394
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,700
you just spilled everything because you were asked.

395
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,800
If someone you barely know talks about deep stuff, you should be cautious.

396
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,390
You're right for the first time.

397
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,530
Isn't he cute?

398
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,130
Yeah. He looks like a neighborhood mutt.

399
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,750
I think I'm getting jealous.

400
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,750
You could say something like that to a person that you just met?

401
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,170
There you go with your bullshit.

402
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,000
But he really is a good kid as you get to know him more. And he's pretty good at work.

403
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,040
You are too.

404
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,490
You really are a good kid and also pretty good at work.

405
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,690
What's up with you?

406
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,350
What do you mean? It's the truth.

407
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:38,940
Earlier when he asked you to teach him how to workout and called you "teacher," I thought he was just like you.

408
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,350
Maybe the you when you were eighteen?

409
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,660
- Hyung!
- So, you can go now. You even have an apprentice.

410
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,960
No way.

411
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm going to live with you until I die.

412
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,500
But Hyung.

413
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,980
- Yeah?
- Do you like rice cakes?

414
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,850
Rice cakes?

415
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,670
Apparently, she doesn't eat rice cakes.

416
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,580
When you get sick eating something, you tend to avoid that food.

417
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,340
But I still like rice cakes.

418
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,470
But she hates rice cakes. Even though I was the one who got sick.

419
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,630
She asked me why I came.

420
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,920
Why I came to Korea and the reunion.

421
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,660
I couldn't say anything.

422
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,420
Then she told me to go.

423
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,630
She said to forget it and go.

424
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,260
But you know what?

425
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,260
I really didn't want to leave.

426
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,860
<i>Can you come right now?</i>

427
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,220
<i>I can't seem to get this to work.</i>

428
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,070
<i>I can't go.</i>

429
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,000
Help, my foot.

430
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,620
His replies are always the same.

431
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,140
<i>Can't go.</i>

432
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,550
<i>People can't go through if you're there like that.</i>

433
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,790
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

434
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,430
<i>You don't have to.</i>

435
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,930
<i>- Do you like him that much?
- Excuse me?</i>

436
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,630
<i>The whole neighborhood knows that you're waiting here for the guy living on the 8th floor.</i>

437
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,110
<i>So everyone knows but Lee Hyeon Kyu?</i>

438
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,330
<i>- That I'm waiting?
- I heard he went to study in Japan.</i>

439
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,140
<i>Why are you waiting for him here when he's not even here?</i>

440
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,160
<i>Then where would I wait for him? This is the only place.</i>

441
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,480
<i>This is the only place I know. So where should I wait for him?</i>

442
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,770
<i>What if you meet him? What are you going to do?</i>

443
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,440
<i>I don't know.</i>

444
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,640
<i>I just...</i>

445
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,700
<i>I just feel sorry for everything.</i>

446
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,530
<i>What are you so sorry for?</i>

447
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,230
<i>We didn't get to drink at the Han River.</i>

448
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,660
<i>We didn't get to go to Itaewon on Halloween.</i>

449
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,010
<i>We didn't even get to kiss.</i>

450
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,400
<i>Okay.</i>

451
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,030
Excuse me?

452
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,260
I'm stopping the series.

453
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,290
Writer, what are you talking about?

454
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,260
We have a contract with a set date and quantity.

455
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,240
Did you get a better offer from somewhere else?

456
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,430
Not really. I'm sick.

457
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,570
I got ovarian cancer. Stage three.

458
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,910
Well, it wasn't great, uploading the series so irregularly.

459
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,840
Can you relay it to the company, saying something like,

460
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,130
"The series is indefinitely discontinued due to the writer's personal reasons"?

461
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,970
I'll take care of announcing it.

462
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,560
Writer, I...

463
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,240
Please stop if you're going to say something like "cheer up".

464
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't really feel like saying thank you to those kinds of comments.

465
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,610
Since I can't keep my energy up,

466
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,930
I got more sensitive and cranky.

467
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,840
Please understand me.

468
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,470
Today is the company dinner, right? You'll hear it there, too.

469
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,740
Ji Jo King's quite a blabbermouth.

470
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,760
He's a classmate of my ex-husband.

471
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,740
It's better to hear from me than hear it from him.

472
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,010
I should've given you more attention. I'm sorry.

473
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,110
Why are you sorry? I'm the one who's sorry.

474
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,770
You should take care of your health, too.

475
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,940
Or just live a little recklessly. I regret it now.

476
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,140
- You regret it?
- Yeah.

477
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,170
I regret it. I should've just liked what I like and hated what I hate.

478
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,740
I shouldn't have worried about what others thought, but worried about what I thought.

479
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,310
I shouldn't have said nice things to others, but have done that for myself.

480
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm done. I'll get going.

481
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,320
I love your outfit today. You look pretty.

482
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,180
- Sorry?
- You were always pretty.

483
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,510
I didn't want to regret not telling you that.

484
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,210
Please don't come out.

485
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,550
<i>Life story, let's go!</i>

486
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,790
Let's go.

487
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,950
How did you manage to get younger since I saw you last?

488
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,090
And manage to come here in your busy schedule.

489
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,260
Hold on.

490
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,650
This is a little something for you.

491
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,060
Gosh, you're making me look bad.

492
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,780
I don't know if I'll be able to open this!

493
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,950
You're more than worthy to drink that. I make a living thanks to you.

494
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,600
Ten people definitely answered their phones.

495
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,080
And six of them said they got it.

496
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,130
They said they got it, not they'll come.

497
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,140
That's fine. Writers usually don't come to these things.

498
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,310
He's the only one who doesn't miss a single one.

499
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,270
My dream is to be a writer. Since they can avoid company dinners.

500
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,360
My dream is to be the CEO. No company dinners.

501
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,340
Hey. What's your dream?

502
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,400
My dream?

503
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,470
To live recklessly.

504
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh right! Have you all heard about Writer Dalgona?

505
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't think it's suitable for here.

506
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,550
I think the editors should know this. What if they make a mistake?

507
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,950
I'm just worried about that.

508
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,450
She has cancer. Ovarian cancer.

509
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,440
- That's why her series is on and off.
- That's too bad.

510
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,750
I know. Her husband abandoned her because he didn't want to take care of her.

511
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,150
I know well because I was his classmate.

512
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:53,040
You just got to be nice. She's so stubborn.

513
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,290
I would run away if I was the husband.

514
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,850
What's with the mood here? I was just making a joke.

515
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,450
Manager Tak. Manager Tak!

516
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,410
You should be nice, if not—

517
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,790
If not what?

518
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,240
- What?
- If not, what?

519
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,060
W-What's wrong with her? Are you drunk?

520
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,480
What if I was drunk or not?

521
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,970
I told you it wasn't suitable here.

522
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,510
- "Kka"? (informal speech ending)
- I heard "Kka-yo" (formal speech ending), Hyungnim.

523
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,010
It was "yo," I said it.

524
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,740
Kids these days are so scary.

525
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,560
Why do you have to be so cranky? I was just trying to make people laugh.

526
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,360
At this rate, you won't be able to get married.

527
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,580
Writer, you're a bit too much.

528
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,750
You guys are the same age, right?

529
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,680
- Are you taking her side since you are on the same boat?
- Hey!

530
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,530
- Hey?
- Why are you butting into other people's lives?

531
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,570
Who gave you the right to meddle?

532
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,030
H-Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

533
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,800
You should be meddling with your own manuscript.

534
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,550
Oh wait! You don't even meddle with it, right?

535
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,120
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

536
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,840
A bit.

537
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,900
Even if I can't go get married, I will be going somewhere.

538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,730
In three months, I will die. From cancer.

539
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,930
Before going to get married, I will be going way up there first, so.

540
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:39,150
It must be because I didn't use my heart properly. Like what you said.

541
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,270
Good luck with editing. I'll be leaving first.

542
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,680
What is she?

543
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,690
<i>Recharge.</i>

544
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,380
<i>Why aren't you even crossing the road?</i>

545
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,100
<i>- I'm scared.
- If you're scared, you can call for me.</i>

546
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,640
<i>Through what means?</i>

547
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,570
<i>In any way.</i>

548
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:56,110
I'm seriously so scared. I'm so scared of crossing the street.

549
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:02,400
You told me to call you if I'm scared. You told me to call you however I can!

550
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,960
Fine. You're not coming for something like this, right?

551
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,070
Hey! I'm standing here now.

552
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm standing here!

553
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,670
I'm going to jump off!

554
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,120
You saw last time! If I say I'm going to jump off, I will actually do it.

555
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,550
Whoa! Seriously...

556
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,850
Hey! I'm really going to jump off!

557
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,280
I'm really going to jump off...

558
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,410
Cold bastard. It's almost 12:00.

559
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,210
Bastard.

560
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,130
I'm really going to kill you...

561
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,520
The person who gets hit by the rock I throw...

562
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,610
is me in the end.

563
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,530
This, seriously...

564
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,040
<i>Did you hear? Something big happened at the company dinner for Life Story yesterday.</i>

565
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,400
<i>That little editor... I heard she is sick.</i>

566
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,500
Don't cry.

567
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,640
Don't cry, Na Ji Na.

568
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,060
Don't cry!

569
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,850
<i>[Dong Kyeong]</i>

570
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,920
Pick up your phone...

571
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,540
<i>Tak Dong Kyeong!</i>

572
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,470
<i>Tak Dong Kyeong! Dong Kyeong!</i>

573
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,820
<i>Tak Dong Kyeong!</i>

574
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,190
Dong Kyeong... Tak Dong Kyeong!

575
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,360
- What brings you here?
- It's Writer Lee Hyeon.

576
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,660
Let's talk outside. Manager Tak hasn't come into work yet.

577
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,850
Did you know? That Dong Kyeong is sick?

578
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,160
I didn't know. I heard yesterday.

579
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,860
I'm a crazy bitch... Crazy bitch...

580
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,640
How did I not know that?

581
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,120
You fool... Why? Why didn't I know?

582
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,490
Let's go outside for now.

583
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,100
I will tell you everything I know when we go outside.

584
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,440
I didn't even know that, and last time,

585
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,950
she asked me what I wanted to do if I were to die in a hundred days.

586
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:59,350
I didn't know anything and jokingly asked if she was dying.

587
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,700
Seriously...

588
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,860
I'm such a bad unni.

589
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,860
If you think like that, I'm a bad boss.

590
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,790
Seriously...

591
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,490
Stop thinking about what you didn't do, because you didn't know.

592
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,210
Think about what you can do for her now that you know.

593
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,320
- I'm leaving now.
- All of a sudden?

594
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,010
I'm busy. If I want to do everything for her.

595
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,730
- What are you looking for?
- My car key...

596
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,100
- You drove here?
- Yes...

597
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,290
I'm sorry. I'm not in the right state of mind at the moment.

598
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:46,620
Where is my car key?

599
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,090
Let's go. I'll take you home.

600
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,030
No, it's okay.

601
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,150
I'm really okay.

602
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,420
Look at me.

603
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,090
Let me take you home. It's because I'm worried.

604
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,000
If you cry like that, you won't even be able to see.

605
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,480
Where's your car?

606
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,210
It's behind there–

607
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,230
Noona...

608
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,180
Noona...

609
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,410
This is a symptom caused by increased intracranial pressure.

610
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:10,300
We need to perform a thorough examination, so call me when she wakes up.

611
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,960
Okay.

612
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,600
Thank you.

613
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,010
<i>[Our Auntie]</i>

614
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,940
You have been here the whole day.

615
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,700
What are you thinking about?

616
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,690
Nothing.

617
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,380
That's right. Don't go.

618
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,870
You decided not to see her.

619
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:41,150
You did well. Like that, don't ever see her.

620
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:44,830
Whether she dies or lives.

621
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,640
Don't ever see her.

622
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,390
Live like that.

623
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:57,430
Can you... live like that?

624
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,760
A child must rebel against the parent to grow.

625
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:22,800
Love must suffer from a broken heart to blaze up.

626
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,950
I knew you would come.

627
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:22,250
You endured without coming to see me?

628
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:36,180
If you hide like that, did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?

629
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,910
