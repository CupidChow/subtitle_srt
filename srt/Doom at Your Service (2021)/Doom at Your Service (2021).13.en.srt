00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,550
I really like that.

164
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,990
Whatever.

165
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,960
He's different from you.

166
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,110
If it's a win or lose situation, he'll go at it with full effort.

167
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,410
You always give in as if none of it matters to you.

168
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,090
Don't you know your own weakness?

169
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,540
You always give in without putting up a fight.

170
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,330
The situation is different this time.

171
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,940
What's different?

172
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,630
We're not having a fight. I need to take something from him.

173
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,320
Is that right?

174
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,460
Then this time, you'll win.

175
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:48,100
I've never seen you not get what you wanted before. Including this.

176
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm looking forward to it.

177
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,020
If you lose and can't get over it, then you're a bad mentor.

178
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,510
If he loses and he can't get over it, you taught him poorly.

179
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Either way, I'd have done something wrong.

180
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,490
Whatever the situation, wouldn't it be best that you win?

181
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,180
This is all your doing, isn't it?

182
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,020
What is it between us?

183
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,730
You're not going to tell me?

184
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,780
If you don't want to, then don't. I'll find out for myself.

185
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,760
I wasn't expecting you'd tell me anything anyway.

186
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,750
But if something happens, you can't have something against me.

187
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,200
You've been talking about ghosts lately.

188
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,590
Now you're watching dramas with ghosts?

189
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,760
What? Did you say something?

190
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,180
You're fasting but you've got so much energy.

191
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,940
Why are you watching such scary things?

192
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,660
Aunt, I'm not playing around.

193
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,230
I'm studying.

194
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,360
I need to study about weird beings like this— Wait a minute.

195
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,570
What? Why does this situation feel so familiar?

196
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,190
Is it deja vu?

197
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,230
What? Why are you here?

198
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,750
Oh my! Why are you speaking like that to the doctor?

199
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,830
Doctor? Who? Him?

200
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm so sorry. She must not be fully awake yet.

201
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,300
It's okay. Seeing as she's not feeling well,

202
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,090
there are times when patients become a little hysterical and rude.

203
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,570
Rude?

204
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm going to check on you.

205
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,330
Wait! Wait! Wait!

206
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,570
All good.

207
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,360
Wait! Wait! Wait!

208
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,970
You're all good.

209
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,380
Thank you, Doctor.

210
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,630
Am I the only one that finds this situation weird? Am I the weird one?

211
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,210
Yes, you are weird.

212
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,620
We'll do a few more simple tests later.

213
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,680
See you later, then.

214
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,440
Wow...

215
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,190
Why are you acting like this?

216
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,050
Th-That...

217
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
It's you again?

218
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
All right, stop making a fuss and take a seat.

219
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,670
This is absurd. Why do you keep following me around?

220
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,270
- Hey!
- Stay still.

221
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,290
You really... Do you even know what you're doing?

222
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,420
Don't be mad.

223
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,690
Really. Why are you like this to me?

224
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,460
Hold your breath.

225
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,530
You're doing well.

226
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,650
How many jobs do you really have?

227
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,020
Why are you like this to me?

228
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm here to save you.

229
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,760
Save me?

230
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,320
Oh my.

231
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,230
If you have this on you while you get scanned, you'll die.

232
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,310
Do you know how much this is if this breaks down? I saved you.

233
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,270
You were worried about the machine and not me?

234
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,030
- Hey!
- Don't talk.

235
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,050
He's always telling me to be quiet.

236
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,420
No matter how I think of it, I don't know why I need to be treated this way by you.

237
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,370
Oh my! Hey! Stop right there!

238
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,790
Hey! I was talking to you!

239
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,350
- Patient Tak Dong Kyeong.
- Yes?

240
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,590
Let's go to draw blood.

241
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,350
All right.

242
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,430
Manager!

243
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,940
It's customary to prepare fruit baskets when visiting someone at the hospital, so I prepared this.

244
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,730
Can you even eat these?

245
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,330
- Fasting just ended.
- Good timing.

246
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,430
Is the hospital not feeding you?

247
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,190
Eating is best for you when you're sick.

248
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,890
Eat up. Eat everything! Just tell me and I'll bring it all for you.

249
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,060
I'll be on call any time of the day.

250
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,600
I'll send you all the pictures of handsome men I've saved.

251
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,820
It seems like it'd be boring to be here.

252
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,890
I'm curious, but if you look at pictures of handsome men, does that make it less boring?

253
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,830
Yes. Gives me the strength to live on.

254
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,540
They've gotten so close.

255
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,100
You're right. Makes me proud.

256
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Get close? Who?

257
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,160
Have you prepared anything? Son of the owner of the building?

258
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,360
No way. He must at least have a comment that he's prepared.

259
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,930
Oh. Have you been well?

260
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,530
Something else?

261
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,170
If you need money, let me know.

262
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,990
- Awesome.
- So cool.

263
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
How was that cool?

264
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,520
Let's eat some fruit.

265
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,620
<i>Let's eat some fruits.</i>

266
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,000
<i>- Don't even think about it.
- How could I think of doing so?</i>

267
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,730
<i>You can't steal it. It's expensive.</i>

268
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,090
<i>Expensive?</i>

269
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,930
- I need to get going. Something urgent just came up.
- All of a sudden?

270
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,350
Sorry. I'll call you later.

271
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,960
I'm going to drink with Hyeon Kyu.

272
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,420
Go ahead.

273
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,180
I thought you liked me. Aren't you supposed to stop me?

274
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,630
What if I make a mistake when I get drunk?

275
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,420
A mistake?

276
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,010
Go ahead. My feelings won't change regardless.

277
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,550
If it was that easy, I wouldn't have told you.

278
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,080
Do you really like me?

279
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,400
Since when?

280
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
From the beginning.

281
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,970
When is "beginning"?

282
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,680
From the beginning.

283
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,540
You must be nuts.

284
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,920
How can a person like you make such a dumb choice?

285
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,630
I know.

286
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,310
But letting go is dumb.

287
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,100
Letting go is dumb, Na Ji Na.

288
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,220
Who calls who dumb?

289
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,620
I thought for a very long time.

290
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,990
"Why did I kiss a girl I don't even know?"

291
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,920
"Why did I care so much about a girl, who I don't even know, crying?"

292
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,290
There was the answer from the beginning.

293
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,170
But I just thought that I shouldn't.

294
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,640
Does Hyeon Kyu also know?

295
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,170
Know what?

296
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,690
That we kissed?

297
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,340
Or

298
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,190
that I like you?

299
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,950
He knows everything.

300
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,330
He knew it all.

301
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,980
That's why I have nowhere to back out.

302
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,460
What do you think?

303
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,120
Do you think I'll be able to win?

304
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,020
I don't know.

305
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,670
Why don't you know anything?

306
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Then do you know?

307
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,060
I do.

308
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,130
Tell me the truth.

309
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,940
Come on.

310
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,050
I don't know. It's also driving me crazy.

311
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,740
How did I become the bad girl?

312
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,800
What bad girl?

313
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,490
You're finally getting compensated.

314
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,430
- Compensated?
- No, rewarded.

315
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,270
Team Leader Cha is your reward.

316
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,350
What reward? You've always been badmouthing him to me.

317
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,570
I always thought he was annoying ever since the first day of work.

318
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,460
But he's a good guy.

319
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,210
He's not an easy person. He doesn't open up easily.

320
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,240
That's why he still hasn't opened up to me. That annoying jerk.

321
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,340
Finally, to the tear-jerking love story

322
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,930
of Na Ji Na, a right person came in.

323
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,950
Oh, right! You don't know, right?

324
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,560
What?

325
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
He...

326
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,220
- is super rich.
- Really?

327
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,830
T-That doesn't matter.

328
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,410
What do you mean that doesn't matter?

329
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,230
To be honest, he's also pretty handsome.

330
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,730
And this is a secret. I never told him once in case it made him too happy.

331
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,710
He...

332
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,260
honestly is super funny sometimes.

333
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,450
He is funny.

334
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,590
If you date him, he'll make you laugh every day.

335
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,100
I don't know. Should I go see a psychic?

336
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,890
Should we go together?

337
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,470
- Why?
- Some crazy guy...

338
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,980
No, a doctor... No, No... How should I say it?

339
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,780
- What is it? Is a doctor hitting on you?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,910
He keeps asking me to doom the world together.

341
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,230
Awesome! He's saying that even if the world comes to doom, he'll only love you?

342
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,250
When did I say that?

343
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,450
That's not what I said.

344
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,890
Awesome.

345
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,320
A doctor who fell in love at first sight is wooing?

346
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,100
That's a great hospital romance story.

347
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,090
That not it!

348
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,000
Excuse me?

349
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,910
Never mind. Forget it.

350
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,420
- Boss.
- Yes?

351
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,030
Why did you open a cafe?

352
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,790
You used to be a swimmer.

353
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,470
You even studied abroad.

354
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,740
Why are you asking?

355
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,040
I sincerely enjoy working at a cafe.

356
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,510
You really seem to be born to own a cafe.

357
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,400
But I'm not sure.

358
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,220
Well... I got injured when I was studying abroad.

359
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,420
And was wandering for a long time.

360
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,970
Suddenly, I was really homesick.

361
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,820
I went to a cafe then.

362
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,880
And I realized.

363
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,940
"Coffee is the same here or in Korea."

364
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,140
So that's how you met coffee?

365
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,870
No, that's fake.

366
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,230
It looks cool.

367
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,380
It was either being unemployed or owning a coffee shop.

368
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,990
If you're waiting for something that's meant for you,

369
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,990
just like magic, forget it.

370
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,210
I never knew I'd own a cafe.

371
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,380
If it's fun, just do it.

372
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,290
Don't make fancy plans.

373
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,770
Just do it.

374
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,640
If you just do it, then you'll get better at it.

375
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,160
Then someday, it might become what's meant for you.

376
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,770
You're good. You're doing well now.

377
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,420
Still, do you regret it?

378
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,260
Well, what can I do?

379
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,170
I wasn't good enough to become a national athlete.

380
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,810
Not that. Your first love.

381
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,090
If you knew you were meant to own a cafe,

382
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,980
you wouldn't have left to study abroad.

383
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,170
Then you could've been still dating her.

384
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,720
And you wouldn't be going through the heartbreak like now.

385
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,600
Heartbreak...

386
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,000
She did more than I did.

387
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,930
I just...

388
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,140
I just ran away all the time.

389
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,940
That's okay.

390
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,130
You can just stop running away.

391
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,500
What? Am I pathetic?

392
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
A little?

393
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,570
Who organized the beans?

394
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,480
Oh, it was me. My bad! I was bad!

395
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:48,680
<i> [Ji Na]</i>

396
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,030
<i>Hello?</i>

397
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,260
Let's have a drink today.

398
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,190
Okay, let's do that.

399
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,980
Boss, what do I do with the expired beans?

400
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,720
Let me just go change.

401
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,150
The cafe you work in is here?

402
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,600
Yes...

403
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,230
How are you here?

404
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,410
Athlete, swimming, ghosting...

405
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,520
I kind of got the idea, but I'm going to ask you one question just to confirm.

406
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,980
What?

407
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,040
Is our Boss #1 or #2?

408
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,620
What?

409
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,330
From the want-to-kill #1 and #2, which one is he?

410
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,130
- #1.
- Goodness, Boss!

411
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,500
Please lock the doors.

412
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,170
Let's go.

413
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,560
Have fun.

414
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,420
Slow down. You'll make a mistake.

415
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,190
Fine, just make mistakes. I'll just forget them all.

416
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,020
It must be easy for you.

417
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:55,140
You said you came to Korea and to the reunion to see me, right?

418
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,550
Me too. I went to the reunion every year to see you.

419
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,820
<i>Drink up, drink up.</i>

420
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,040
What if you don't come?

421
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,370
What if you really come? That was what I thought about.

422
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,340
Sitting there, I was looking forward to then disappointed every time.

423
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,380
That's not all.

424
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,880
Because I couldn't go to the front of your house, I wandered around the neighborhood.

425
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,200
I sat at a cafe near your house.

426
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,190
I got off at the subway station near your house and sat there.

427
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,290
Just in case you got off,

428
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:52,260
every time the subway doors opened, I got nervous and nervous again.

429
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,800
Just in case I ran into you, I did those kinds of things a lot.

430
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,690
I didn't know.

431
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm not resenting you.

432
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,420
Don't make a sinner's face.

433
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,670
I'm just telling you.

434
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,210
That I've been loving you alone for a very long time.

435
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,520
In my head,

436
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,550
I loved you alone the whole time.

437
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,190
But...

438
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,770
seeing you lately makes me think this.

439
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,610
The person I loved,

440
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,570
was that really you?

441
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,470
What do you mean?

442
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,050
I don't think I know anything about you.

443
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,670
I found out after meeting you again.

444
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,270
The person that I've been loving is

445
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,160
the you when you were eighteen.

446
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,620
I was standing there alone,

447
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,980
but you were moving along.

448
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,500
That was the same for me.

449
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,890
I don't know anything about you either.

450
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,320
- Yea, so—
- But none of that matters.

451
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,430
I'm not going to run away anymore.

452
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,300
- We ended things a long time.
- End?

453
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,980
I swam for more than 10 years.

454
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,790
Going back to the starting point? It's not hard for me.

455
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,350
I can go back anytime.

456
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,150
I kissed Cha Joo Ik.

457
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,990
I know. It doesn't matter.

458
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,210
It matters to me.

459
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,320
I—

460
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,680
I think it matters to me.

461
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,590
Na Ji Na.

462
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,550
Bitch.

463
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,010
You're crying again.

464
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,330
Why—

465
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,180
Why are you here?

466
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,220
Don't you know?

467
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,190
When did you get here?

468
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,950
I don't know.

469
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,960
What if I hadn't shown up?

470
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,910
I don't know that either.

471
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,990
Anyway, you're funny.

472
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,990
I hear that often.

473
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,180
You always do things that don't suit you.

474
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,710
Confusing me.

475
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,480
Confused?

476
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,400
I didn't do anything to confuse you.

477
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,230
Don't be confused.

478
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,810
I came because I missed you. I came because I like you.

491
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,960
Then make those mistakes only when you're with me.

492
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,760
Your thoughtless mistakes beat me up to death.

495
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,750
Na Ji Na, you crazy!

496
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,340
What? My hair?

497
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,670
Yes.

498
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:03,360
Because the treatment and radiation are both being applied, it'll fall out quickly.

499
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,220
You've seen it before on TV, haven't you?

500
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,130
It'll be better for you to take care of it beforehand.

501
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,390
That's what's most recommended.

502
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,250
Seeing your hair fall out,

503
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,380
might be harder on you.

504
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,020
You...

505
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,970
You had a pretty head shape since you were young.

506
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:38,800
If you had your hair cut short, elders that would pass by

507
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,180
would always comment how pretty you were even with such a short hairstyle.

508
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,560
They would always compliment you.

509
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,400
You remember, don't you?

510
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,610
Yes. I remember.

511
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,600
Hair...

512
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,140
can be grown again.

513
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,740
It'll grow fast.

514
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,550
There are shampoos that help hair grow fast, too.

515
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,470
Yes.

516
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,290
Should I cut it, too?

517
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,100
Seon Kyeong should just shave it with you.

518
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,650
Don't you remember how ugly he was when he had to cut his hair before going into the military? So ugly.

519
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,080
His looks rely on his hair.

520
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,720
Let's make me the only bald one in this household, Mrs. Soo Ja.

521
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,160
You're so good.

522
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,350
You're such a good girl.

523
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,690
I should go

524
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,650
get some hats in advance.

525
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,870
I'll be right back with some pretty hats.

526
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,170
Don't. I have lots of them. You also got some last time.

527
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,250
That was too big. Your head is so small.

528
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,300
Let me see.

529
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,410
About this big?

530
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,030
I'll be right back.

531
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,890
How would you like it?

532
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,220
- Can you do celebrity hair?
- Sorry?

533
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,190
Celebrity hair.

534
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,570
With curly perm and fancy. Like that.

535
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,020
Miss, that's a curling iron.

536
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,880
Please do that.

537
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,560
There, it's all done.

538
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,280
To be honest, you came in in a hospital gown, so I was a little intimidated.

539
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,440
Sometimes people from that hospital come here to shave their heads.

540
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,700
You look so good.

541
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,300
Would it be okay if we took a picture of you and displayed it?

542
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,230
It won't show your face. Just your hair.

543
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,070
It came out so well.

544
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,290
- Are you done?
- Hold on. Just one more.

545
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,710
So pretty. All done.

546
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,860
Then...

547
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,980
Can you shave it now?

548
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,130
Sorry?

549
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,590
Shave it all off.

550
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,260
I'm sorry. You worked hard to do this.

551
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,560
I wanted to do it for the last time.

552
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,250
What do you mean last time? Please come back.

553
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,050
I'll do it again. I'll make you look even prettier next time.

554
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:28,400
No, I think you'll look good in short hair, too.

555
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,500
Now that I see, it wasn't your hair but your face that's pretty.

556
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,030
Will you be okay?

557
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,560
Yes.

558
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,200
Then I'll start cutting.

559
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,570
Okay.

560
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,390
Nosebleed...

561
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,230
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

562
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,310
Hold on.

563
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,730
Bring some tissues.

564
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,540
Don't cry.

565
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,730
Don't cry.

566
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,550
Don't cry.

567
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,880
Don't cry.

568
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,610
I'm sorry.

569
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,220
I'm sorry.

570
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,800
What is this?

571
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,300
Where a-am I?

572
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,420
My house.

573
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,190
Why am I at your house?

574
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,360
Did I get abducted?

575
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,970
Kind of.

576
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,690
I brought you into this dream without your permission.

577
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,470
A dream?

578
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,380
<i>This is a dream?</i>

579
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,700
What?

580
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,870
This feels so real.

581
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,450
Yeah.

582
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,440
You're making me dizzy.

583
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,460
Is this a prison?

584
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,230
Did you lock me up?

585
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,380
- Is that all you got to say to a person that saved you?
- What?

586
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,300
Is that so?

587
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,950
Wasn't that a dream?

588
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,490
No, it wasn't.

589
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,770
Then that dream— No.

590
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,150
That was a dream. Definitely a dream.

591
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,290
That was a dream for sure. Then why...?

592
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,530
That dream?

593
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,850
Earlier in the dream, you were crying.

594
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,350
That was a dream. I don't eat, sleep, nor cry.

595
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,240
I was dead.

596
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,530
And at my funeral, you were looking at my photo

597
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,260
then the tears were just flowing.

598
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,430
I'm not sad.

599
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,700
No matter how much I look at you, I'm not sad.

600
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,660
You scared me.

601
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,830
- Smile.
- What?

602
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,430
- Look at me and smile.
- Why would I?

603
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,530
So I can figure out who you are and what you are.

604
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,120
If I smile, can you figure it out?

605
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,680
One more time.

606
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,260
I can't figure it out.

607
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,300
Where are you going?

608
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,380
Where are you going?

609
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,750
Outside. I need to go out to somewhere open. It's too dangerous here.

610
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,830
Why? Are you scared I might do something to you?

611
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,930
No, I'm scared I might do something to you.

612
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,910
Do what?

613
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,980
I don't know, since I don't know who you are.

614
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,870
If I do, run as fast as you can.

615
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,620
Are you sure outside is safer?

616
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,610
There's nothing dangerous.

617
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,850
Since there's nothing alive.

618
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,440
What is this place?

619
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,360
My subconscious.

620
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,020
Subconscious?

621
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,150
Like your beach.

622
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,250
That's why.

623
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:27,230
- What?
- You said this place was like my beach.

624
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:33,300
You live with the mindset like this that makes you so sharp.

625
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,650
Stop saying nonsense and try to remember.

626
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,840
Do you really not know me?

627
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,140
I don't.

628
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,970
Think before you speak.

629
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,050
Why would I have to think? I know when I see.

630
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,780
<i>Why should I think? I know when I see pretty things.</i>

631
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,990
Have you... ever been here before?

632
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,720
Would I have? Think before you speak.

633
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,070
What? Do you think you've seen me here before?

634
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,530
You really must've seen me here before.

635
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:23,010
No.

636
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,980
- But why–
- I don't know.

637
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,720
Regardless, you need to get re-educated for language.

638
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,810
Can you speak so I understand? In longer sentences.

639
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,830
You are always staring at books, but what are you even doing?

640
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,830
Hey, tell me honestly. You don't read the books, right?

641
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,130
You're just holding it, right?

642
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,890
There's a saying written by that author.

643
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,090
“To die is nothing, but it is terrible not to live.”

644
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,050
Are you saying that to me?

645
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,020
No. I'm saying it to myself.

646
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,010
Since I am nothing.

647
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,460
Since I am not alive.

648
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,300
Out of that writer's famous quotes, there's this saying as well.

649
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,400
"The reduction of the universe to the compass of a single being,

650
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,530
and the extension of a single being until it reaches God - that is love".

651
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,270
Try to remember what is beautiful from now on.

652
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:34,490
Then, this place will become better.

653
