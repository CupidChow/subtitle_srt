It seems like multiple tumors.

The fact that you are dizzy and throwing up,

11
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,210
is all because of this.

12
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,590
To know more in detail, we have to conduct a biopsy.

At least a week.

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,070
I already used up a few days of my annual leave, so I can't take a week off.

If you do the surgery, you'll live for one year.

31

Hello?

171
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,820
As you can see, my body is in this condition so I can only do this much.

172
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,870
Could you explain... this situation?

173
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,580
You should be the one explaining.

174
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,700
You're the one that committed adultery, but if you tell me to explain,

175
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,090
what kind of soap opera would that be?

176
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,760
So this was that genre.

177
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes. Everything has been explained.

178
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,050
So this is the place you two first met?

179
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,790
- Did you search for everything? Like the conversations on his phone?
- You don't think I did?

180
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,920
Then you should know that he'd never contact me on the weekends.

181
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
And wouldn't answer at night. You would've seen all of that too.

182
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,860
Whenever I couldn't reach him, he'd say his phone died or was on silent, or he was working.

183
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,000
I guess you would've seen all of that.

184

That was always on my mind.

187
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,890
Yes. I didn't know.

188
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,390
You dated him for three months, but you didn't know?

189
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,520

190
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,420

194

but I can't let out my anger on you.

198
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,520
It's that bastard's fault, so what should I do?

199
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,890
Who are you trying to convince?

200
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,790
It's not something I should be saying to you.

201

So... please live on while blaming me.

202

- Your caring and innocent husband

Oh, is it Thursday?

<i> Not being able to cry was an old habit of mine.</i>

357

<i> At the age of ten, I knew how to swallow my tears.</i>

<i> The tears that couldn't fall but were swallowed...</i>

<i> I wonder where they all went.</i>

<i> I think I know now.</i>

<i> Will you raise them then, Sister-in-Law?</i>

<i> As if it's easy raising someone else's child.</i>

365
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,960
<i> She's right. Rather than them growing up walking on eggshells,</i>

00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,750
<i> we could just send them to some facility—</i>

<i> The children might hear.</i>

368

<i> From that day on, the tears that I could not weep swelled like a lump...</i>

<i> Eventually settling at a place in my head.</i>

370

Yes, Aunt.

<i> Today is the death anniversary of your mother and father, right? Did you buy it?</i>

<i> It would be funnier being depressed on this kind of day.</i>

376
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,080
The family's gone crazy. Seon Kyeong's in Jeju-do.

<i> He's a funny guy.</i>

378

<i> Why would he go to Jeju-do alone without me or his sister?</i>

379
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,030
I guess it doesn't matter if he's not here.

380
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,660
Aunt, don't give him money.

381
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,810
Why? Did he cause trouble again?

382
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,780
That jerk, I should teach him a lesson—

383
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,040
How are you going to teach him a lesson when you're in Canada?

384
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,650
<i> It's so freaking cold in Canada.</i>

385
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,300
Hey, at this age, I moved to an entirely different country to live prosperously, and yet, I'm suffering.

386
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,310
It seems like you're living okay, seeing that you're still talking about love.

How are things at work? Are you sick?

388
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,730
Work? Of course, things are good at work.

389
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,160
I'm not sick either. Even when I do get sick, it's only a cold.

<i> Oh, Kevin is getting ready for work.</i>

395

480
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:41,510
Something like that. To put it clearly, I entered your dream without permission.

481
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,850
Dream?

482
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,710
<i> It's a dream? This?</i>

483
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,570
Wow... Wow!

484
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,030
Wow!

485
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,260
Wow! What is this?

486
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,280
- Is this real?
- Even if this is a dream, you have no manners at someone else's house.

487
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,510
You, earlier–

488
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:19,580
But I was feeling uncomfortable since earlier. Why do you keep talking informally to me?

489
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,730
- You spoke informally first.
- I did?

490
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,800
You said "bring doom upon all," so I thought you wanted to drop the honorifics.

491
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,190
I wasn't saying that to you.

492
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,830
Then, who were you talking to?

493
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,130
I'm Doom.

494
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,030
So this is a dream, right?

495
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,330
What is this?

496
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,180
Where is the front door?

497
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,130
I'm going to go home.

498
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,660
It seems like you're not liking the location.

499
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,760
Whoa!

500
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,290
You wanted it.

501
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,490
This is for the cake.

502
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,010
So, you're Doom?

503
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,540
I'm responsible for at least part of all doom.

504
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,430
Then you can bring doom upon all! Why are you doing this to me?

505
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,440
Do you think I haven't done that before?

506
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,100
It didn't work. It may be because of some program's will.

507
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,770
What–

508
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,590
To put it directly, you're the client and I'm the provider.

509
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,890
It's like a system by Mother Nature, something like that. This is different, though.

510
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,730
This is the will of a human.

511
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,970
Why does it have to be me out of everyone else?

512
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,530
You're the only person who made a wish like that, right when the star died.

513
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,510
Then, do you disappear if you don't grant me the wish?

514
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,080
In fantasy novels, that was the case.

515
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,940
No way. It's like an event.

516
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,710
"Doom, on the day you are born, become someone else's hope."

517
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,180
Wow.

518
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,180
Is this a nightmare?

519
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,090
Your life is a nightmare.

520
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,470
What?

521
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,270
Sadly, it's time for you to wake up.

522
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,320
What?

523
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,080
It's a dream...

524
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,620
It's a dream.

525
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,270
It's a dream... It's a dream!

526
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,370
What do I do?

527
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,670
What is this?

528
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,470
Crazy bastard, seriously!

529
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,250
Is he an American or what?

530
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,100
Seriously!

531
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,630
I will make it not hurt.

532
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,530
You won't be in pain for not even a day while you are dying.

533
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,090
How does that sound?

534
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,140
Can I have a roll of kimbap?

535
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,830
Okay, fine.

536
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,570
I will grant one of your actual wishes.

537
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:53,950
Not getting rid of alcohol smell, but something you really, really want.

538
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,650
I can't do more than that.

539
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,030
<i> I shouldn't listen to a crazy man.</i>

540
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,200
<i> I shouldn't.</i>

541
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,840
<i> Why is everyone going to work by subway today?</i>

542
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,570
<i> I just wish they'd all disappear.</i>

543
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,610
<i> See? You want it, too.</i>

544
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,250
<i> You.</i>

545
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,350
I'm just sick. Yeah.

546
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,750
I'm sick for sure.

547
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,470
Manager Tak.

548
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:41,800
Thanks to the cafe owner on the first floor, I pushed the resignation for tomorrow.

549
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,380
Manager Jo, about yesterday...

550
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,400
The CEO isn't coming to work today.

551
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,820
He must've gone to his girlfriend to beg on his knees.

552
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,300
- What?
- He was so hysterical yesterday that we thought he fought with his girlfriend.

553
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,200
Then, Da In heard about it on the rooftop.

554
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,610
She said it was no joke.

555
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,900
That man really can't keep his private life out of his work.

556
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,940
I'll drink this well.

557
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:12,380
You need to eat well. You can't say that you'll just quit work because you're so mad and humiliated, okay?

558
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,610
If you quit, we'll die here. You know that, right?

559
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,550
Why won't you answer? Hey.

560
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,300
Manager Tak, writer Siberia is in the meeting room.

561
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,180
Already?

562
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,480
It's not time for the meeting right now, though.

563
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,310
Well, authors just only think about themselves.

564
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,090
Where's writer Siberia?

565
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,040
Inside.

566
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,570
There he is.

567
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,290
Are you a stalker or American? Choose one.

568
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,660
Why are you excluding me being a kimbap business owner and a doctor?

569
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,590
What did you do for them to be so entranced like that?

570
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,950
It's not "entranced like that," they were truly entranced.

571
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,250
<i> This is driving me crazy.</i>

572
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,940
<i> Am I crazy?</i>

573
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,450
You're not crazy.

574
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,470
Writer Siberia is just wandering somewhere for now. He needs time.

575
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,690
- How do you know?
- Because I sent him somewhere.

576
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,990
No, not that. How do you know my thoughts?

577
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,200
Oh. You're a bit dense, aren't you?

578
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,530
Are you...?

579
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:42,270
I'm really curious about this.

580
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,890
You hate your CEO and the company. Why do you come to work?

581
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,160
Should I make your CEO disappear?

582
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,060
It's possible as a wish.

583
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,830
Don't look into my heart.

584
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,580
Well, I don't "look" necessarily, I hear it.

585
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,060
Don't listen, then!

586
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:04,650
Then, accept my offer. With those I have a promise with, I don't look or listen.

587
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,550
Just leave.

588
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,890
I'll leave, then.

589
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,990
I'm going to a meeting with writer Lee Hyeon.

590
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,760
Thank you for the coffee.

591
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,930
Unnie!

592
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,670
<i> Hey, I just woke up. You're going to come anyway, so why call?</i>

593
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,310
I'm going to go insane.

594
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,430
<i> What is it? Did the CEO nag at you this early in the morning?</i>

595
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,730
This doctor...

596
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,870
No, this American, no, this crazy man,

597
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:51,560
I mean, this kimbap business owner, I mean—

598
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,610
What should I start with?

599
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,130

God is on my side.

611
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:45,210
Choose. Will you die here?

612
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,920
Or will you hold my hand?

613
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,200
The answer to that is...

01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,990
