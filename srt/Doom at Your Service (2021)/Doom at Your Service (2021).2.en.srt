The answer to that is...

12
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070

Not that.

Your... How should I word it?

20
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm searching for an expression that isn't rude.

21
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,590
- My identity?
- Yeah.

22
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you just very suspicious, or curious?

23
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
I don't have much of either. It's just common sense.

24
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,870
Common sense or whatnot, you just saw it. You experienced it. Accept it.

25
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,940
It's easier said than done.

- You are alive right now.
- But what?

27
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,810
It was Switzerland, then Italy outside.

28
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,360

29
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,510
Your dream, subway station, workplace, do you not remember?

30
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,640
I do remember. But it doesn't make any sense.

31

Okay. Look carefully.

Why? I didn't do this.

47
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,490
My identity is related to electricity.

48

52
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,110
You just made a contract with someone like that.

53
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,450
Keep that in mind. I'm bad.

54
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,320
I need to stop fooling around now and leave.

55
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,390
- So suddenly?
- Something just happened that's getting on my nerves.

56
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,820
Just think of that as a show to commemorate our contract.

57
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,870
I hope that it made you happy.

58
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,950
You didn't want to grab onto it earlier, but now you don't want to let go?

59
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,890
You told me to not let go.

60
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,380
What is this?

61
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,020
My promise. Since I told you I won't make it hurt.

62
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,040
Don't be too reassured. It's like charging. Once a day, before 12.

63
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,830
Charging? How does it work?

64
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,000
- By holding my hand.
- What? Why?

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,180
In case you run away.

66
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,620
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyeong.

67

Excuse me...

69
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,070
- Yes?
- Earlier, at the crosswalk...

70
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,110
Do you not remember?

71
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

Should I just kill you?

75
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,420
I told you not to park your car, but you keep doing that.

76

I told you doom is within my jurisdiction.

77

Do something to me! I keep hearing voices.

78
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,140

It's something I go through every day.

Just kill me! Please!

88
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,950
Out of all the people you stabbed, three people died.

89
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,180
Two of them are still unconscious.

90
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,640
But you are perfectly alive, so you should be thankful to me.

91
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,140
That wasn't my plan...

92
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,030
It wasn't like that...

93
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,020
Does living go according to plan?

94
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,770
I'll stop here for today.

95
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,360
I made a good contract today, so I'm in a good mood.

96

What are you?

97
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,790
Have you heard of this phrase?

98
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,210
Between the start and finish, the beginning and the end.

99
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,560
The finish. The end. That's what I am.

100

What is it? What's wrong?

112

I'm going to die.

113
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,960
- What?
- I'm going to die!

114

Why?

115
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,860
Unnie, did you...?

116
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,110
It's all gone.

117
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,450
It's what the heavens wanted.

118
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,080
The heavens thought my writing was useless, so it's all gone now.

119
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,890
They should've made this happen before I wrote all of it!

120

This is all that bastard's fault!

No, no, there's just someone else.

Unnie! Have a seat first.

129
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,420
You're a pro! Why are you being like this?

130

You're the one who knows best what to do in a situation like this.

131

I don't know. Should I just die?

132

There is just one answer, Writer.

- What is it?
- Write it again in an hour.

What? My will?

135
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,440
- Your writing.
- My writing?

136

I'm going to the rooftop.

137

If you're going to go, write before you go.

138
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,430
What's the point of writing it, anyway? I don't even get a good response.

139
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,260
The company didn't really like this one, either.

140
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,280
What'd they say? Be honest.

They said you're worth keeping an eye out for.

151

Don't lie! My views are already half what they should be, anyway.

Well, after changing to pay-to-read, usually half the subscribers are lost, anyway.

Yeah, that's true.

So, for now, let's just write. Okay?

If you don't keep up your upload schedule,

- Let's say you allow me to not have any pain until I die and my wishes come true.

321
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,960
But I die without wishing for doom.

322
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,840
Will you do that?

323
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,590
Then, someone else will die instead of you.

324
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,290
The person you love most at that moment.

325
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,390
What? What are you saying?

326
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,440
The doom is brought from here to here.

327
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,750
It's nothing big.

328
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,200
It's different from what you originally said.

329
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,680
We never talked about this.

330
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,710
No matter the contract, there is always a penalty.

331
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,150
It doesn't matter. You already agreed to the contract.

332
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,980
Nothing else to say.

333
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,990
You con artist.

334
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,560
If you already knew about it, would things have changed?

335
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,230
I don't think so.

336
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,440
Okay. Here's a fair contract.

337
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,040
I'll let you choose again. What will you do now?

338
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,320
Hurry and choose. You might die.

339
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,940
- Hey!
- You win some, you lose some. That's how it goes.

340
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,990
Think it through well. Throughout your life, you've won things by losing other aspects.

341
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,300
Why?

342
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,580
Why is it me?

343
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,150
Why on earth does it have to be me?!

344
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,860
Fate.

345
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,510
How cruel.

346
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,530
Fate is cruel to anyone.

347
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,480
Stop! Stop it!

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,720
Look! I bought so many!

What?

383
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,170
I took care of the thing with the insurance.

384
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,810
It just so happened that the guy who rented us the car was...

385
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:52,620
My alumni's older brother's aunt's cousin's...

386
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,240
Anyway, I took care of it because it was someone I know.

387
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,220
For real.

388
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,120
Noona, what's wrong?

389
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,780
Noona, have you been drinking?

390
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,960
Did you change your ways from beating me up, Noona?

391
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,610
Noona.

392
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,170
<i>Excuse us. We'd like to place an order.</i>

393
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,820
Yes.

394
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,410
That'll be $2.00.

395
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,780
I'm so pissed off.

396
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,910
Anyway, it's important to keep them hanging.

397
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,100
It's playing hard to get.

398
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,580
That way, the readers can be like "Next episode, what's going to happen?"

399
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,960
and follow along while salivating because they're so curious.

400
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,790
You understand right, Manager Tak?

401
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,090
Like a skirt's hem.

402
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,360
As if you can see, or not.

403
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,670
A skirt's hem?

404
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,450
Does Writer Lee Hyeon not come to the office these days?

405
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,830
What?

406
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,890
I heard that writer is really pretty.

407
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,810
I heard you're close with her. Show me her face!

408
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,720
You know, there's something between writers.

409
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,250
Their eyes can meet, then their heart, then...

410
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,920
You know what I mean, right?

411
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,580
You really don't know your place.

412
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,930
What?

413
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,870
This guy. An old man who doesn't know where he stands and makes inappropriate advances to a middle schooler.

414
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,630
You did that on purpose, right? Does he die later?

415
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,430
That has nothing to do with the social stigma.

416
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,600
That setup is to emphasize innocent love.

417
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,080
That kind of bastard lies about being a married man and seduces an unmarried woman.

418
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,590
What?

419
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,510
Why doesn't social stigma come into play with love?

420
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,840
Love that extends beyond social stigma is called a crime.

421
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,980
Oh, is he a criminal?

422
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,220
Manager Tak, why are you speaking like that?

423
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,610
Why?

424
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,850
You wrote it so realistically, so I'm being amazed by that right now.

425
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,370
Seriously, you used to not be like this.

426
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,610
When a person suddenly changes, she will die.

427
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,320
Is it because I brought up Writer Lee Hyeon?

428
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,600
No! It's because it seems like it's time for him to die.

429
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,790
I was just wondering if it's now.

430
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,680
Where are you going in the middle of a conversation?

431
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,780
I'm going to meet the lovely Writer Lee Hyeon.

432
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,170
Is it because of a man?

433
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,400
Man? What man?

434
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,220
I don't have a creature in sight that I can call a man.

435
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,260
Think carefully.

436
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,420
He's someone really familiar with water.

437
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,690
That guy is blocking your future.

438
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,520
You've been possessed by a water ghost.

439
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,550
You're going to change your pen name after all this time?

440
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,590
She told me to get rid of everything that relates to that guy.

441
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,760
Thanks for the meal.

442
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,420
Why did I use that guy's name as a pen name,

443
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,750
and why did he happen to go swimming?

444
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,260
That's really shocking though... How did she guess it was related to water?

445
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,760
Unnie, where's that place?

446
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,350
Why? Is something not working out for you?

447
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,790
No, just work.

448
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,610
Are you thinking of leaving? There are many other companies besides yours.

449
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,530
It's not that I want to leave.

450
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,250
- Tak.
- Yeah?

451
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,190
Should I...

452
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,730
quit being a writer?

453
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,190
Unnie!

454
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,390
<i> I will mix the rice for you.</i>

455
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,960
You can eat it after the cheese melts.

456
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,130
Unnie, if you were to die in a hundred days, what would you want to do?

457
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,530
Why? Are you dying?

458
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,830
I was just curious.

459
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,800
First, I would buy a five-layered cake and dig in.

460
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,280
- What else?
- Travel.

461
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,620
What else?

462
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,840
What else?

463
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,790
I don't know, I haven't really thought about it.

464
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,860
I was thinking about it while frying the rice...

465
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,420
I'll make sure to see you succeed before I die.

466
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,850
That's why I'm saying this.

467
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,080
I know you're going to be shocked, but don't be too shocked.

468
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,810
Let's end the series.

469
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,390
Not right away, but within this month.

470
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,990
Let's just think of it as concluding a little early.

471
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,190
This is all because of that guy.

472
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,890
Lee Hyeon Kyu, that water ghost.

473
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,910
Also, this isn't something big, but

474
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,540
my boyfriend turned out to be...

475
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,480
a married man.

476
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,700
What?! That scumbag.

477
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,600
You saw everything. You all have brains, so you must've gotten a grasp of the situation.

478
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,290
Team Leader, what do you think of this matter?

479
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,330
I have no opinions.

480
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,770
Then I will assume you will continue having no opinion.

481
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,060
How about you, Jeong Min?

482
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,590
Regardless of what happened, it's true that it's an affair.

483
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,800
She's not that kind of person.

484
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,500
You never know.

485
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,990
That man seemed like he was rich, too.

486
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,890
She must like everyone who has money.

487
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,040
Then she should've seduced you or the CEO.

488
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,950
What do you mean?

489
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,710
Just that you seemed jealous of her meeting a rich guy.

490
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,540
That was a good comparison. You can say something like that?

491
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,300
I don't feel so great, all of a sudden.

492
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,930
It seems like we're done making a consensus, so let's head out.

493
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,260
It's too late to get off work on time, but I want to at least finish working overtime early.

494
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,920
- I still have things to discus—
- Aren't you done?

495
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,420
I'm done.

496
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,310
Do you know that the owner of the cafe is the building owner's son?

497
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,200
- Wow...
- Whoa!

498
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,370
Welcome! Just a moment.

499
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,320
<i> So he must live at the penthouse.</i>

500
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,530
<i>I heard the building owner's son lives there and manages the building.</i>

501
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,400
<i>So the yellow sports car sitting in the underground parking lot must be his.
[Lee Hyeon Kyu]</i>

502
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,980
<i> I heard it's owned by the building owner's son.
[Lee Hyeon Kyu]</i>

503
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,790
You worked hard!

504
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,040
You guys are already came back?

505
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,370
- I thought you were quitting.
- You told me I couldn't.

506
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,830
Why aren't you getting off work?

507
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,370
There are some things I need to finish editing.

508
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,280
Why are you working so hard, when you said you're going to quit?

509
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,060
Then, do you want to do this instead?

510
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,280
Good luck.

511
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,700
What did Writer Lee Hyeon say?

512
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,360
She agreed. The writer knows the best when the feedback isn't great.

513
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,230
What did you talk about with Writer Ji Jo?

514
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,980
It's not Ji Jo. It's Ji Jo King.

515
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,320
I just can't bring myself to call him by his full name.

516
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,770
I dissed him a bit.

517
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,950
Oh, what's the occasion? You couldn't bring yourself to speak harshly before.

518
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,560
Good job.

519
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,000
He wants us to change the person in charge to someone pretty.

520
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,110
Do people edit with their faces? That's ridiculous.

521
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,260
Make Jeong Min do it, he's pretty.

522
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,600
You think I'm pretty?

523
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm sorry, I have a weak stomach.

524
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,570
I'm going to do it, because I'm the prettiest.

525
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,050
Why did you meet that kind of guy?

526
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,310
I was editing at a cafe, but someone almost spilled their coffee while walking by.

527
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,000
I was almost done, around 80 episodes worth.

528
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,220
But suddenly, someone appeared and blocked that coffee with his body.

529
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,180
- Credit given.
- Credit given.
- Credit given.

530
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,330
I told him I'll pay for dry cleaning, and asked to grab a coffee,

531
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,830
like what you witnessed.

532
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,190
You worked hard.

533
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,380
<i>[2020. 11]</i>

534
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,840
<i>[2020. 12]</i>

535
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,680
<i> These are the only pages I can fill out.</i>

536
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,640
<i> When I look at dramas or movies, people facing death were able to leave with no regrets.</i>

537
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,630
<i> Oh, and think of your wish, Tak Dong Kyeong.</i>

538
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:13,250
<i> I don't have money to leave, dream to accomplish, or unfulfilled love to pursue.</i>

539
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:20,050
<i> If I can live for ten years, I would want money, a dream, or love.</i>

540
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,270
<i> But I will live for only a hundred days.</i>

541
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,960
<i> Then someone else will die in your place.</i>

542
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,170
<i>The person you love the most at that moment.</i>

543
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:35,580
<i> The world that I managed to survive is nothing different from doom in the end.</i>

544
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,190
<i> You told me to bring doom upon the world.</i>

545
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,520
<i> I'm so tired...</i>

546
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,500
<i> Is everyone just living like this?</i>

547
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,170
<i> While being tormented by life and death.</i>

548
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:04,400
<i> Like if I'm neither living nor dying.</i>

549
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,880
<i> - Bring the defibrillator!
- Yes!</i>

550
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,620
Patient, are you okay?

551
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,130
I don't think I can live past twenty in this life.

552
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,450
What kind of God is always in pain and sad to the point of death?

553
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,700
For the world to exist, somebody has to pay the price.

554
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,350
That price to pay is a heart disease this time?

555
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,630
It's probably because they ask for God over here the most.

556
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,930
Fine, since they are the reason for your existence.

557
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,020
The moment a large group of people called for God, I opened my eyes.

558
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,750
So I will gladly pay the price.

559
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,150
That's the job that God, who was created by humans, must fulfill.

560
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,600
And the job that you, who was created by that God, needs to fulfill.

561
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,940
You already know that you can't escape your destiny.

562
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,820
She's not going to resign herself to the world, like you did.

563
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm going to make her resign herself to the world.

564
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,480
Really?

565
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,720
Even if that's the case, will it be possible?

566
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,100
Humans made God, so Doom is nothing.

567
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,060
You and I were made from human's will.

568
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,820
Then I must do something.

569
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,760
Since that's not all there is to humans' will.

570
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,040
Leave. Before it turns 12.

571
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,890
God doesn't not know.

572
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,940
I just always pretend not to know.

573
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,200
<i> I will take it now. One, two!</i>

574
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,570
<i> I will take it one more time.</i>

575
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,810
<i> No, no, just smile widely!</i>

576
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,700
- Do you want to die?
- What?

577
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,990
Why are you here? Did you want to get slapped?

578
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,400
Is that how you apologize normally?

579
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm not sorry.

580
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,420
Let's fight after we take all the pictures. Smile!

581
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,060
Smile, he's telling you to.

582
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:31,160
Can you photoshop my chin even more?

583
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,790
Then this won't be your face.

584
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,140
Is that important?

585
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:40,000
Of course! An ID photo is used to check if it's actually you.

586
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,910
This isn't an ID photo.

587
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,660
Can you print it that size? With the frame?

588
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,720
They usually use black, right?

589
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,010
Do you want me to make your eyes bigger?

590
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,740
The eyes...

591
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,210
Do you have to do this? You can just take the car comfortably.

592
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,900
I don't want to take your car.

593
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,370
You don't know what might happen.

594
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,170
Then at least take the bus.

595
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,830
Don't talk to me.

596
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,390
I just want to walk.

597
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,230
You're really wasting time.

598
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,870
Shouldn't every second be valuable to you right now?

599
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,680
You only look at me when I pick a fight.

600
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,580
Humans are so strange.

601
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,240
Why do they want to leave those things behind?

602
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,260
They can't even see it anyway.

603
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,470
It's not for me, it's for others to see.

604
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,030
I do that sometimes.

605
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,440
Then you decided you want to die, right?

606
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,730
Things like you only care about yourself, right?

607
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,880
You don't know to what extent I only care about others.

608
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,750
Even now? Even after getting slapped, I came running to save you.

609
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,490
Time is ticking.

610
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,020
Get used to it. If you want to walk with me.

611
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,910
Are you doing this?

612
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,400
I didn't do it,

613
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,740
but it's because of me.

614
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,490
That too?

615
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,330
Sometimes.

00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,590
That's right.

618
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,680
How do you live like this?

619
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,320
I'm not alive. I'm just existing.

620

<i>My everything leads to doom.</i>

623
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,550
That's the reason for my existence.

624
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,420
What if you don't do anything?

625
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,160
What if you just don't do anything?

626
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,080
<i> Hell opens.</i>

<i>It seems like the world is going crazy nowadays.</i>

631
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,450
<i> It's crazy! Why would he kill himself?</i>

632
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,780
<i>He's like a devil. Why won't he die?</i>

<i> If there is a god, he should take away bastards like that first.</i>

When you gain something, you lose something.

635
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,060
Everything I've accomplished in life, was done by things I've lost.

636
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,500
I get what that means now.

637
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,860
There has to be winter for there to be spring,

638
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,340
and there has to be darkness for there to be light.

639
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,330
There has to be death for there to be birth.

640
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,890
It's something like that, right?

641
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,700
So you're winter, darkness, and death.

642
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,040
Yes.

643
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,150
Like what you said, you only care about others.

644
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,360
You came to me when I only cared about myself.

645
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,640
But how long do we have to be holding hands?

646
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,550
I thought we were just holding them because we liked it.

647
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,660
Why did you follow me all the way here? It's burdensome.

648
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,950
Anyway, thank you.

649
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,500
You can leave now. I'm not going to run away somewhere.

650
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,530
Should we see each other tomorrow?

651
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,320
- What?
- Should I come and pick you up?

652
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,170
You choose.

653
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,580
Why are you like this, all of a sudden?

654
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,990
I shouldn't care if you're in pain and crawling on the floor.

655
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,600
Do you have bipolar disorder or something?

656
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,690
You were doing so well earlier. Seriously.

657
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,370
Hey! It was good between us until now.

658
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,020
We were understanding each other, and exploring each other's identities.

659
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,770
I'm telling you to cling onto me.

660
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,240
What, to you?

661
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,760
To the fate that came to you.

662
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,090
Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

663
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
Tak Dong Kyeong!

664
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,650
W-W-What is this?

665
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,120
Nothing is stopping me right now.

666
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:59,100
Oppa must've been crazy, Dong Kyeong.

667
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,180
Oppa didn't mean it all!

668
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,140
It wasn't that you were crazy, it's that you are crazy even at this moment.

669
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,000
This guy is crazy!

670
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,530
We loved each other, we did!

671
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,300
I didn't mean what I said at the company, about not being sincere!

672
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,880
This is my sincerity! Drunken truth!

673
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,680
Yes, Drunken Truth! I sang that for you many times, do you remember?

674
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,270
Wow. Let go of me!

675
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,290
If you are drunk, you should go back home. Why would you come here?

676
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:33,400
♪ You're right, I may be drunk ♪

677
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,910
♪ This may be a mistake ♪

678
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:41,590
♪ When the morning comes ♪

679
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,740
♪ I will confess to you now, I loved you from the beginning ♪

680
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,100
Let go!

681
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,340
Seriously, let go!

682
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,170
Get lost from my life!

683
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,200
♪ Even if my sloppy declaration seems corny ♪

684

686

687
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,960
Let go.

688
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,560
Let go of me, you bastard!

689
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,240
Is this your wish?

690
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,960
- What?
- Making this disappear from your life.

691
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,590
Are you crazy? Why would I waste my wish on a guy like this?

692
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,900
Let go of this!

693
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,580
Should I take care of him like this?

694
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,940
Honey...

695
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,010
Honey...?

696
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:34,910
<i>(Boyfriend.)</i>

697
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,150
Honey? Tak Dong Kyeong, who is this bastard?

698
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:41,470
This is the bastard you are sick and tired of, right?

699
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,310
Let me take care of this, so go inside and eat, Dear.

700
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,070
I made some cold cucumber soup that you like.

701
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,550
Dear?

702
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,200
Cold cucumber soup?

703
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,340
Tak Dong Kyeong, you had a man?

704
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,950
You were living the good life with him?

705
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,840
This is better.

706
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,120
We can equate me lying about being a married man and you were living with some guy,

707
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,480
then we can start our relationship again. Right?

708
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,530
What is all this?

709
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,400
What is this?

710
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey! It's not what you think! Hey!

711
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,580
Which guy is the married man, and which one is the one you're living with?

712
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,350
First, let me beat up the married man first.

713
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Wait a moment. W-Who are you?

714
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,730
- Hey!
- Hey!

715
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,460
- Why are you like this?
- Hey!

716
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,300
Come here!

717
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,120
Seriously, so funny.

718
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,710
It's unbelievable.

719
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,180
It's fine, I'll do it.

720
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,530
Thanks for helping me—

721
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,670
I said I won't make it hurt.

722
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,410
I can see why you think of me.

723
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:56,830
I was wondering what human would make that kind of wish at that moment.

724
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,860
Why is that me thinking of you?

725
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,280
Since I am Doom.

726
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,350
You were the only person who was thinking the same thoughts as me at the same time.

727
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,770
I am thankful, for many reasons.

728
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,090
Hey...

729
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,970
This can't do.

730
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:51,160
Let's live together.

731
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,830
Us.
