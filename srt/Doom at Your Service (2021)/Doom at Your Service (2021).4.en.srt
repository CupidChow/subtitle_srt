00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,930
<i>You were the first girl who went over a wall to meet me.</i>

165
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,920
<i>Gosh, you scared me.</i>

166
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,840
<i>You don't seem to be from my school.</i>

167
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,090
<i>Do you live here?</i>

168
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:16,000
<i>Nice. Do you know where the closest supermarket is?</i>

169
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,290
<i>Thirty minutes.</i>

170
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,800
<i>- Thanks.
- By car.</i>

171
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>Jeez.</i>

172
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,330
<i>Is there any liquor stores near by?</i>

173

<i>Hey, Lee Hyeon Kyu! I have something to tell you.</i>

179

Straight forward female lead.

189
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,600
If we get a runaway male lead, it would be your novel.

190
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,470
It looks that way to you, too?

191
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,460
Why? Is that what Team Leader Cha said?

192
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
No. It's just...

193
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,880
How can you forget such a spectacular first love?

194
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,960
It's a given that it'd leave a mark in your life.

195
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,550
It's fine! Don't worry about it.

196

What does Team Leader Cha know?

197
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,700
Right. What does he know?

198
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,260
He was in my dream all the time.

199
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,010
Right, dream.

200
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,600
You should dream.

201
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,780
- Dream?
- Think about him a lot before bed.

202
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,070
Do you have his picture? Look in his SNS and look at it before you go to bed.

203
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,400
- It's game over once he's in your dream.
- Yeah?

204
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,230
Yeah.

205
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,460
Okay. You saved my life today.

206

She says life.

207
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,600
Are you betting your life on love?

208
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,960
Who is this guy that makes my Tak just burn up in passion?

209
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,060
Three months. I will tell you everything after exactly three months.

210
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,030
- Three months?
- Yes, just wait for three months.

211
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,570
I will tell you in person after three months.

212
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,260
To you. In a perfect shape.

213
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,900
Perfect? You should be in love and in a mess.

214
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,200
No matter how much of a mess, I'd be in love. Would I beat you?

215
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,350
So what? I've never even kissed him.

216
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,420
They say the end to one's first love is regret.

217
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,500
Since we're on the subject...

218
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,620
I met the person I had my first kiss with.

219
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,940
Awesome! That guy you don't even know the name of?

220
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,700
When, where, how, why?

221
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,160
Don't be too surprised.

00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,780
What is it?

223
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,610
Cha Joo Ik.

224
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,350
That guy's name is Cha Joo Ik. Team Leader Cha.

225
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,650
Your boss.

226
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,380
What?

227
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,490
That Cha... That Cha Joo...

228
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,170
What? Why?

229
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,010
- Nothing.
- "What? Why? Nothing." Isn't it an inappropriate answer?

230
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,820
- What is it?
- Sorry?

231
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,490
You've been staring at me ever since you got back from the meeting.

232
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,690
I wasn't.

233
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,270
I really wasn't.

234
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,230
Fine then.

235
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,810
- Team Leader.
- What?

236
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,150
Nothing.

237
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,120
- You know, Team Leader.
- I don't know.

238
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,100
What?

239
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,270
Have you ever ended up loving someone you hated?

240
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,640
No. I did kiss someone I hated.

241
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,600
Why?

242
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,980
I hated her because I pitied her.

243
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,250
And pitying ended up with kissing.

244
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,890
Did I answer your question?

245
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,880
Hmm? What?

246
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,620
Whatever it was.

247
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,620
Yes, you did.

248
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,390
Good.

249
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,560

250
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,520
I can hear you. Speak quieter.

251
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,570

Speak quieter.

253
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,090
Still how can he kiss her?

254
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,350
- Stop speaking.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,730
- Go home.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,680
Then I will get... going.

257
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,700

- Denied.

Why do you need my car when you're seeing your classmates?

I told you to stop being pretentious.

273
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,890
Am I being pretentious because I want to?

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm not avoiding your fights.

329
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,760
I want to see you throw away everything because you're crazy about me.

330
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,660
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying.

331
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,880
Trying what?

332
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,430
How to fall in love with a special being.

333
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,630
- So did you find the answer?
- Yes.

334
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,530
- What is it?
- The looks.

335
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,420
You've got to be good-looking.

336
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,300
What did you just mean?

337
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,190
Well, nothing good.

338
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,400
- You must've forgotten your first words to me.
- Yes, I did forget.

339
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,360
I didn't forget!

340
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,560
Be quiet.

341
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,390
You should stay with me tonight again.

342
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,730
As you wish. Should I go or do you want to come over?

343
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,390
You come over. To my dream.

344
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,090
An unni I know told me that if you see the person in your dream then the game's over.

345
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,270
It sure is a dream.

346
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,410
You must really like this place.

347
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,360
You brought me here though.

348
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,940
Your subconscious chose it though.

349
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,520
Is that right?

350
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,850
I must really be having a hard time.

351
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,800
Okay, let's go for a second round.

352
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,860
- Second round?
- Yes.

353
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,400
Where to?

354
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,660
First, to the school.

355
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,570
<i>You know there are those kids at school who seem mysterious and physically weak, right?</i>

356
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,740
<i>With a pale face, you know. I am in that role.</i>

357
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,250
<i>Watch out!</i>

358
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,020
Are you all right?

359
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,810
Hey, it's different.

360
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,770
<i>What is it this time?</i>

361
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,250
<i>Connecting worldview.</i>

362
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:10,640
<i>That high school girl is now all grown and followed a sunbae she liked and entered the same university.</i>

363
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,160
<i>For your information, they met at a church.</i>

364
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,430
<i>The sunbae is an accompanist for the church choir.</i>

365
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,610
<i>Uh, so it's the "church oppa" feel?</i>

366
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,820
Sunbae,

367
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,400
please drink this first.

368
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,360
Thank you.

369
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,070
Next.

370
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,130
What is it this time?

371
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,870
Reverse.

372
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay.

373
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,390
Stop!

374
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,270
This is missing. Ah.

375
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,260
Ah, I can't deal with this.

376
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,330
Uh, same for me.

377
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,160
This won't do.

378
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,890
Then, we are done for today?

379
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,130
Talk about yourself a little.

380
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,000
In order to love someone, you should know that person's world.

381
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,530
Show me, your world.

382
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,000
My world?

383
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,460
Just as my subconscious world is here,

384
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,220
there must be a subconscious world for you as well.

385
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,110
I will say it again, but I am not human.

386
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,450
My world probably wouldn't be what you think, either.

387
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,390
But, well...

388
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,730
As you wish.

389
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,380
This is my world.

390
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,190
<i>The reason for the disappearance of everything.</i>

391
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,650
<i>The god of everything that disappears.</i>

392
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,510
<i>To love things that will disappear when you touch them,</i>

393
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,840
<i>must be lonely.</i>

394
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,360
<i>So much so, that you never want to love.</i>

395
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,930
<i>I think I can understand a little now.</i>

396
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,670
<i>From what you are,</i>

397
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,910
<i> to running away.</i>

398
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,830
Aren't you going to work?

399
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,000
It's the weekend.

400
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,130
Okay.

401
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Yesterday, that dream—

402
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,360
For now, I am going to forgive you.

403
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,710
- What?
- I forgive you, I said.

404
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,300
Who are you to (forgive me)?

405
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,830
The person who is trying to love you.

406
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,260
Love basically starts from forgiveness anyway.

407
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,020
What a laugh! As a mere human, forgive?

408
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,240
That's what I say.

409
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,910
Besides, love basically starts from hate.

410
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,070
But then again, you need to hate in order to forgive.

411
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,450
I don't forgive you.

412
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,950
Today is kind of like a truce.

413
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,300
I know that you have no one to talk to.

414
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,720
Because it's the same for me.

415
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,410
She bothers me more and more.

416
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,560
It's pretty, painted.

417
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,790
As expected, Na Ji Na.

418
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,870
Who...?

419
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,190
I was intimidated for no reason.

420
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,690
What? Why?

421
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,040
You were intimidated?

422
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,020
Why? Did you do something wrong?

423
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,560
- Did you have a fight with Hyungnim?
- "Hyungnim," my foot.

424
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,510
You should have called first.

425
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,330
Why?

426
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,540
- Is Hyungnim coming over?
- Ah, this...

427
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,700
You normally stay home on weekends.

428
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,000
So I just came.

429
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,730
Well, you know...

430
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,850
Can you let me borrow some money?

431
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,120
What? Why? What kind of trouble did you cause again?

432
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,110
No... No trouble.

433
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,730
I want to attend an academy.

434
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,160
An academy?

435
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,910
I want to get a license. Personal colorist.

436
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,350
I heard that's big now.

437
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,060
Hey, Tak Seon Kyeong, what did you major in?

438
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,700
Leisure sports. But I have a talent.

439
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,140
I was very sensitive to colors when I dressed, even as a child. You know that as well, right?

440
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,990
If you are going to talk nonsense, leave. I am tired.

441
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,020
Do I have to listen to something like this even on the weekend?

442
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,990
"This kind of talk"?

443
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,330
When I sent you to a computer academy, you got into gaming.

444
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,100
When I sent you to a culinary school, you quit saying that you will gain weight.

445
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,240
You said you would learn Jiu Jitsu, but you quit saying that it hurts when you get hit.

446
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,880
You are like that. You, really...

447
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,550
Are you going to live like this even after I die?

448
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,800
If you aren't going to let me borrow, just don't. Why talk about living and dying and stuff like that?

449
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,130
Never mind. I am at fault for bringing it up.

450
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,930
What would you know? When you don't even have a dream.

451
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,350
What?

452
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,250
Whose fault is it?

453
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,760
Are you saying it's because of me?

454
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,900
Then, whose fault do you think it is, that I live like this without a dream?

455
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,690
If you don't like it, then quit your job. All you have to do is quit, isn't that right?

456
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,460
- Why use me as an excuse?
- If I quit...

457
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,720
If I quit, with what money do I clean up after you when you cause trouble?

458
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,010
Who asked you to clean up after me?!

459
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,330
I will take care of it myself.

460
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,890
Quite frankly, you did it because you wanted to.

461
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,380
- What?
- Don't blame me.

462
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,150
Frankly, are you the only orphan?

463
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,670
I am an orphan, too.

464
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,740
But I have a dream, you know.

465
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,120
I have things I want to do, you know.

466
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,350
Never mind. What good is it talking to you?

467
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,070
How could you understand me when I don't understand you, either?

468
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,610
Never mind. I will take care of it myself.

469
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,830
I'd rather die than live like you.

470
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,120
Hey, what did you say just now?

471
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,250
- Let go! You told me to leave, didn't you?
- Hey!

472
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,060
Hey, let me see. Are you okay?

473
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,180
Never mind.

474
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,850
Hey!

475
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,560
Love, it seems there isn't much to it.

476
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,140
He was sincere about everything he said.

477
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,860
I am in no mood to deal with you now.

478
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,820
Isn't it too much, when you are trying desperately to save him?

479
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,790
It's none of your business.

480
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,510
Why? Are you going to forgive again?

481
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,250
Aren't you mistaken?

482
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,120
That the one forgiving is the nicer one.

483
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,500
That being nice is winning.

484
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,630
It must have bothered you when I said that. Sorry, okay?

485
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,040
Yes. You bother me. You continue to do so.

486
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,490
I got it.

487
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,510
Let's just stop for today, please.

488
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,350
What would happen if I kill him right now?

489
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,300
There are many ways.

490
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,400
I just have to bring one of the dooms out there upon him.

491
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,860
Would you still forgive me when I do that?

492
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,720
Would you be able to love me?

493
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,300
Take back what you just said.

494
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,950
Strange. I am just curious.

495
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
I said take it back.

496
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,560
Do you know how many stars disappear per second?

497
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,130
7.9 billion disappear. Who are you?

498
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,520
Are you better than a star? Tell me.

499
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,600
Why do you need to live?

500
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,920
You are just like that.

501
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,260
I want to throw a rock at a calm lake,

502
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,080
and you happened to be the rock that was nearest.

503
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,290
A very convenient coincidence.

504
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,030
I wish you would die.

505
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,060
You...

506
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,570
I wish you would die.

507
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,190
I wish you could experience death.

508
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,620
Then, you would know how I feel.

509
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,970
Is that right?

510
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,040
If that's your wish.

511
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,440
Try to fulfill it, your wish.

512
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,370
It's not a wish I can fulfill, it seems.

513
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,000
If I could, I would have died a long time ago.

514
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,510
If I can't kill you,

515
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,130
I will at least make you miserable.

516
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,390
So that you can live miserably forever.

517
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,390
Try it, if you can.

518
