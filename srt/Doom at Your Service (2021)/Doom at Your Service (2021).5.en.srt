I am not worthy of you doing something just because.

There must be a reason.

If it could make you fine, I'm okay if I didn't have a leg.

143
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,750
Even if I have to go, your leg is what's important right now.

144
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,560

Right. Since it's bleeding like crazy.

146
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,680
What do you mean "even if I have to go"? How can you say that?

Let's get you admitted to the hospital. Let's go back.

- Why are you asking?

You looked tired and I thought you'd want to sit.

- I don't need to.
- Why not?

00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,390
Exactly. I wrote during my busy schedule and you can't upload like that.

481
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,130
I'm offended.

482
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,160
I really don't have any words to say.

483
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,080
How about we eat and have a little,

484
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,490
a very little conversation?

485
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,990
It won't take too long.

486
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,430
To buy you something yummy,

487
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,950
tada! This is called a corporate credit card.

488
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,080
- A corporate credit card is—
- I know what that is!

489
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,550
Exactly.

490
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,850
I babbled too much.

491
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,500
Can I eat something expensive?

492
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,900
Of course. Just tell me what you want.

493
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,020
Then I want...

494
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,380
Yup Dduk.
<i>(A famous korean rice cake chain)</i>

495
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,430
Sure.

496
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,520
Welcome.

497
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,880
Hey! You...

498
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,020
Sorry? Me?

499
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:46,040
It smells so yummy, right, Writer?

500
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,750
After I eat, I'm leaving school early.

501
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,650
I'm not going back to class.

502
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,030
We'll take one tteokbokki and—

503
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,460
Add udon, double cheese, assorted tempura, minus veggie tempura, and change that to kimbap, please.

504
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,950
Super spicy, please.

505
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,700
Yeah.

506
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,050
Yeah?

507
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,110
That person just said "yeah," right?

508
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,390
No! I think he said "yes."

509
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,460
What if I make a mess out of the ending? Like the Earth explodes.

510
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,280
That's on a big scale and a great idea.

511
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,610
Suddenly, the main characters die–

512
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,080
Sad ending. It's an ending that will be remembered for a long time.

513
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,200
After everything, they find out it's just a dream.

514
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,990
Inception of the web novel world.

515
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,310
But you...

516
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,820
Yes?

517
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,740
It's strange.

518
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,580
What is?

519
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,300
Why is there no sausage here?

520
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,270
Sausage?

521
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,960
Sausage, it's here!

522
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,340
Anyway, it's not something that can be easily discussed like that.

523
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,010
Editor, you're not a writer, so you won't know.

524
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,370
Of course. To be honest, editors and whatnot, you don't need them.

525
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,750
I just really like your novels.

526
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,000
They're so fun and I want to see more.

527
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,880
It's just my personal ambition.

528
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,510
You can't tell the CEO that I told you this, okay?

529
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,900
Can I add more sausage?

530
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,250
Yes, of course! You can add anything you want here.

531
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,270
Over here!

532
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,020
Can we add more sausage and cheese?

533
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,830
We don't have any.

534
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,860
- Then, more dumplings!
- We don't have them either.

535
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,800
- Then, how about quail eggs?
- I don't have them.

536
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,710
Why do you not have anything?

537
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,550
Isn't this place very rude?

538
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,080
Sausage...

539
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,090
Quail egg... If they don't have them, I'll go get some eggs baked in an elvan stove.

540
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,500
I saw that there is a convenience store next door.

541
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,760
Just wait a moment.

542
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,560
I can do that, right, Boss?

543
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,110
Hey. You're so young, yet why are you so rude?

544
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,990
You only want sausage.

545
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,110
Oh, yes. It must be nice to be old.

546
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,080
You don't like sausage?

547
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,270
This little kid keeps talking back to me.

548
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,540
You're all grown up, yet picking fights everywhere.

549
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,720
Do you want to die?

550
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,220
No. I don't want to die.

551
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,190
That Noona will pay for it.

552
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,480
Hey! What is this? Where did the writer go?

553
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,760
<i>Writer, did you go home safely?</i>

554
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,060
<i>I'm worried that I may have taken too much of your time.</i>

555
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,350
<i>I'm sincerely sorry about what happened today,</i>

556
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,230
<i>and I'll be grateful if you reconsider one more time what I told you today. </i>

557
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,910
<i>Then, I look forward to an optimistic response from you, Writer.</i>

558
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,930
<i>I got it, so stop texting me.</i>

559
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,200
<i>I'm doing a face mask right now.</i>

560
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,580
Seriously, this bastard who was born yesterday...

561
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,410
You should've been like that earlier.

562
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,610
Do you know how to function in the real world?

563
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,070
It seemed like prison life instead. Is he a prison guard?

564
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,860
Something like that. It's so stuffy.

565
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,700
Hey, but since when did you start following me?

566
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,290
Is it from the rice cake store? Or–

567
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,850
From the moment you were born.

568
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,840
I follow humans from the moment they are born.

569
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,370
You just caught on now.

570
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,650
I was done with public observation,

571
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,860
and came to do a private observation, but I ended up doing a public observation again.

572
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,000
What did you conclude after your public observation?

573
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,560
Since you witnessed it, you need to think.

574
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,230
How about you just make a wish to get money?

575
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,460
If you came up with that kind of conclusion, no thanks.

576
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,630
I'm going to use it for something really, really good.

577
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,470
Even if it's cheap and dirty, what can I do?

578
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,590
It's not like I'm the only person living like this.

579
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,990
Does everyone live like that?

580
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:41,060
Everyone's like that. They all have their own circumstances.

581
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,620
As much as you?

582
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,060
I don't know if it's as much as me.

583
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,320
But all according to their duty they have to fulfill.

584
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,860
All according to the weight they have to pull.

585
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,690
What is this?

586
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,420
It looks like your duty is too heavy.

587
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,760
It seems like you would want this.

588
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,770
What the? This isn't a dream?

589
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,200
It's real. Be careful so you don't drown.

590
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,770
It's real?

591
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,960
It feels like I can live now.

592
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,660
I'm telling you for the first time.

593
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,290
Whenever I wanted to cry, I always sat here like this every day.

594
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,590
Since I was young.

595
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:29,760
I would come when I missed my mom, and when I missed my dad.

596
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,830
I'd also come when Seon Kyeong caused trouble.

597
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,760
I'd come when I felt sorry for my aunt, and come here for no particular reason.

598
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,420
Why?

599
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:45,250
You could just cry. Why did you sit here and hold it in?

600
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,430
You're right.

601
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,520
I just didn't want anyone to know that I was crying.

602
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,300
You can cry alone when nobody is looking.

603
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,270
Then nobody would know.

604
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,350
I know.

605
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,880
I know. I don't like that.

606
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,890
But why are you suddenly so nice to me?

607
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,060
So I can seduce you.

608
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,550

629
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,750
Studying my butt. He didn't pick up because he was too busy fooling around.

630
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,940
He was able to post pictures frequently on social media.

631

When I think about how he broke up with you through a text,

-<i>Let's meet. I have something to say.</i>

640
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,920
- Did you call the wrong person?
-<i>No.</i>

641
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,370
<i>So let's meet, right now.</i>

642
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,120
<i>[Like how our eyes meet, I wanted to kiss him.]</i>

643
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,730
<i>[Kiss]</i>

644
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,940
Is the desk going to break by you doing that?

645
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,590
Where are you going?

646
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,110
Meeting.

647
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,250
Look over them. I already finished doing that.

648
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,190
What is this?

649
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,890
A proposal?

650
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,620
From your story's content, characterization, story research, and episode organization,

651
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,490
the unfolding of the story, and keeping your mental health in check.

652
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,470
I will make you get into the Top 10.

653
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:47,660
If that happens, you need to give me 5% of the manuscript fee as an incentive.

654
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,350
I already made a contract with that company.

655
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:52,220
You are signing a contract with me, 1:1.

656
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,590
I decided that there is a possibility.

657
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,360
- It's not like getting into the Top 10 is easy as it sounds–
- Absolute acceptance.

658
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,160
Absolute obedience. Are you prepared to do that? Then it'll be easier.

659
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,440
- How can I trust you –
- Did you get your hair done?

660
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,220
What?

661
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,980
Yes.

662
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,920
I have a reunion to attend.

663
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,960
Is Lee Hyeon Kyu coming?

664
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,310
He probably is. That's why you got your hair done.

665
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,680
- Excuse me –
- Don't go.

666
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,690
To the reunion.

667
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,150
Don't see him.

668
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,160
But even if I say this,

669
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,740
you're still going to go see him. Right?

670
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,440
That's not something you should care about.

671
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,490
I saw all of your writing, and all you need is one thing.

672
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,320
A new male lead.

673
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,450
I will help you.

674
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,040
So let go of any regret. That...

675
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,460
is not revenge, it's regret.

676
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,420
Are you going somewhere?

677
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,230
Yeah, to work.

678
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,350
W-Wait.

679
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,690
Why?

680
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,710
Let's go together.

681
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,280
Buy haam!
<i>(Haam: box of wedding gifts sent by bridegroom to his bride before wedding)</i>

682
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,650
Buy haam!

683
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,290
Aigoo, this is so hard! I can't go any further than this!

684
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,770
Aigoo, he can't continue on because he's so hungry!

685
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,730
What should we do?

686
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,780
Don't brag when you're marrying for the first time in your 50s.

687
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,920
Go easy. Here, take this.

688
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,110
Bring the table of drinks and snacks quickly!

689
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,080
Bring it quickly!

690
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,430
Buy haam!

691
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,220
<i>Buy haam!</i>

692
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,360
I never saw people selling haam.

693
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,210
This tradition still exists. I only saw it on TV.

694
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,370
He's heading towards doom.

695
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,280
Not breathing is not the only form of dying.

696
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,180
That's also dying.

697
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,220
You can't see things that you were able to see every day.

698
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,680
It's my job to watch over that as well.

699
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,170
It's pretty and sad.

700
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,320
Transient things are generally beautiful.

701
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,730
Do you know what a supernova is?

702
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:20,550
At the moment a star dies, it shines very brightly as it disappears.

703
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,590
But that becomes energy for a new star to be born.

704
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,080
And it becomes a star again.

705
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,880
Isn't it like that?

706
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,290
That and you.

707
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,860
Don't comfort me. It doesn't help.

708
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,280
I thought I picked wrong.

709
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,320
I thought I made the wrong choice of picking you.

710
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,130
And that's why it led up to this troublesome state.

711
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,490
Do you still think that?

712
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,870
No.

713
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,300
I think I picked well.

714
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,100
So that led me to conclude this.

715
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,060
Love me.

716
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,120
If you can love me, do so.

717
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,290
I thought that will be a good method. So,

718
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,030
become the first human to ever love me.
