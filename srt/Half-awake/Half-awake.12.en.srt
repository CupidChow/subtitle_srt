2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,700
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,040
Your father owed me 100 million
and ran away.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,920
Where did Dad go?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,160
Your dad... he...

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,200
He ran off.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,040
Your dad, Ye Qishan,

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,400
is dead.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,320
He's dead.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,800
You're awake.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,440
Where's Xingyue?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,800
Where's Xingyue?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,960
Where's Xingyue?

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
She's fine.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
Where are you going?

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,990
That's none of your business.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,610
Ye Xingwan, calm down.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,400
You have to face the truth.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,020
This has nothing to do with that.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm going to meet someone.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,280
I'll go with you.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,120
Keep it down. Dad just fell asleep.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,440
Xingwan,

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,850
what brings you here?

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,600
Dad,

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,240
Xingwan's here.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,160
Mr. Xiao,

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm so sorry.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,480
It's all my dad's fault

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,360
that you have suffered so much.

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,800
I haven't had the courage
to face you all these years.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
I came today to tell you something.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,840
My dad has passed away.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Please don't worry.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
What my family owes you,

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,320
I'll make sure it's repaid.

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
It's alright, Dad.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,480
Gu Yixiao,

39
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,120
could you lend me one million?

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Ye Xingwan,

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,080
I'm lending at high interest rates.

42
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,880
I could never pay it off
in this life anyway.

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,240
It doesn't make a difference.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
All these years,

45
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,580
you've been avoiding them.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
But why do you suddenly want

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,920
to clear your dad's debt?

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,400
You know exactly

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
why I stayed away.

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,720
Five years have passed.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,640
I never once asked you for money.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
But now,

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,960
I really need that money.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
All along,

55
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,660
my dad always travels around
carrying a briefcase

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,480
and pretending to be a wealthy person.

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,720
I've been ashamed of that
since I was a kid.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Then he borrowed from you,

59
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
which drove my mom to her death

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,300
and left me paying for his mess.

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,680
He caused Mr. Xiao lose everything.

62
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,240
I can't respect his cowardly way
of running away.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,620
I wish that not a trace of his blood

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,040
flowed through my veins.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
But now he's gone.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
He can never repay Mr. Xiao's debts.

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
I'm begging you.

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
Let me pay off this debt.

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,520
Prepare one million

70
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,660
and transfer it to Ye Xingwan's account.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Gu Yixiao.

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,000
Back then,

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
why did you do business with my dad?

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
You're such a sharp-minded person.

75
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,150
Why would you choose

76
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,670
to partner with someone like him?

77
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,940
Because he was easy to mislead.

78
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,520
(Gu Yixiao,)

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,760
(when you heard my dad had died,)

80
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,320
(you looked so nervous.)

81
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,440
(Did my dad's death)

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,640
(have anything to do with you?)

83
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,240
What really happened back then?

84
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,320
He couldn't stay afloat anymore,

85
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,280
so he fled overseas.

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,440
No one knows how he died.

87
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,180
Do you think she'll misunderstand me?

88
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,360
She?

89
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
Does what she thinks even matter?

90
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,560
When have you ever

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
cared about what she thought?

92
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,720
Or is it that

93
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
you can't let go now?

94
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
I need some time alone.

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,440
Is everything ready?

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,520
Stick to the plan.

97
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,560
(Gu Yixiao,)

98
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,960
(you broke the rules)

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,480
(for her.)

100
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,480
(Luckily, I kept a backup plan
back then.)

101
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,100
(Five years ago)

102
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,820
(Ye's father)
Mr. Chu,

103
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
I swear, I won't say a word.

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
I really won't talk.

105
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,920
Please, just let me go.

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
You even kept the evidence.

107
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,160
No, no, you've got it wrong.

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
I kept it for my daughter

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,960
just to give her something to remember.

110
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
It's true.

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
Mr. Chu,

112
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,740
I'll give you this gold watch.

113
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Can you let me go then?

114
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,690
I swear I'll stay quiet.

115
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,000
I promise I won't tell anyone.

116
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Go.

117
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
Well...

118
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Can I?

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Get out.

120
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,040
We just let him go like that?

121
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,520
He's not getting away.

122
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,640
Should we hand the USB drive
over to Mr. Gu?

123
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Keep them for now.

124
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Let Biao deal with him.

125
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,080
(Never thought something from back then)

126
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,920
(would actually come in handy now.)

127
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,240
(Gu Yixiao,)

128
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,400
(whether his death is connected to you)

129
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
(doesn't matter anymore.)

130
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
(Someone has to take the fall.)

131
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
(And you are the right person.)

132
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
When I was a kid,

133
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
my dad often played with us.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,960
Every time I won,
he'd give me a little prize.

135
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,240
A few days before he disappeared,

136
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
he suddenly came into my room one night,

137
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
and handed me a doll.

138
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Then he told me a whole bunch of things.

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,720
But back then, I was just too sleepy.

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,720
So I pushed him away.

141
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,520
I never thought that would be
the last time I saw him.

142
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,920
Turns out we did share

143
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,480
such warm and precious moments.

144
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,920
Back then, to take care of Xingyue,

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,360
I had to watch him take you away.

146
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,560
Starting today,

147
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,940
I'm not leaving your side for a second.

148
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,120
My dad's been gone for so many years.

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,720
But there's barely anything left.

150
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,760
He used to always show off this watch,

151
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
pretending he was wealthy.

152
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
Whenever he needed a loan,

153
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,560
he'd use this watch to fool people.

154
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
My dad even

155
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,720
borrowed money from your dad.

156
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Bro,

157
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
do you really think I'd lie to you?

158
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,120
We've known each other for years.

159
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Others may not know me well,

160
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,400
but you know me well.

161
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
I may lie to anyone, but never to you.

162
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,760
You know that.

163
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,160
I sold my family estate.

164
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,520
That's how I saved up this money.

165
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,400
If it weren't for those people
at the welfare home,

166
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
waiting for food and medical care,

167
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
I...

168
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,240
I'd never dare risk it.

169
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
I know it's tough for you.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,960
I promise you.

171
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
This deal is a sure win, no loss.

172
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
How about this?

173
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,600
I'll leave this gold watch with you.

174
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Think of it as collateral.

175
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,680
If I really lose money,

176
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
it's yours.

177
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,960
Trust me.

178
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,780
Xingwan, you can't do that.

179
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
That's Mr. Ye's keepsake.

180
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,560
It's...

181
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,740
(Teddy bear)

182
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,360
Xingwan, what are you doing?

183
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,650
♪The fragility stripped away by you♪

184
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,130
♪Keeps dragging me down endlessly♪

185
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,450
♪If not once devoured by blazing flames♪

186
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,530
♪Who would ever understand
this baptism by fire♪

187
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,730
♪You betrayed me so decisively♪

188
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,170
