(Speed limit;

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,120
- Stop!
- Let me go!

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,110
Sir,

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
that's not mine.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,100
My dad's dying.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,040
Please save my dad.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,520
Take him away.

(Young Ye Xingwan)

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,340
(Young Ye Xingyue)

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,360
Xu Dashan is here.

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,640
Miss Ye went to meet him.

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
Mr. Xu.

15
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,820
(Xu Dashan)

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,520
Miss Ye,

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
you teamed up with Gu Yixiao
to set a trap.

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
Living life on the edge like this

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,720
is not easy, right?

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,320
You'd be better be with me.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Mr. Xu, you're just teasing me.

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,440
If you have any other requests,
just say it.

23
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,080
We'll do our best to meet you.

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,640
You know what I mean.

25
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,940
To win someone over, win their heart.

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
If you want to achieve your goal,

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
you need some strategy:

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,040
show weakness,

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,640
appear pitiful,

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,560
and spark a man's instinct
to protect and claim you,

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,600
making him lose control over you

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
and unable to keep hold of you.

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,120
Once his emotions are slowly
in your hands,

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
that's when you've won.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,520
Lately, someone told me

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm facing a bloodshed misfortune.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I need to connect with someone deeply

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,960
with someone born
in a Yin hour and Yin month.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
Mr. Xu,

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,360
you're flattering me.

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
But your request,

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,560
I might not be able to meet it.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
I know.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,000
He never really had you.

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
I'm truly sorry, Mr. Xu.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
I drank a bit too much.

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,160
Excuse me for a moment.

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
Miss Ye,

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,400
weren't you with Mr. Xu?

50
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Gu Yixiao,

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,440
let everyone else leave.

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Ye Xingwan,

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,940
what's gotten into you?

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm perfectly fine.

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
Xu Dashan's request,

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,560
I can't do it.

57
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
You can't?

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,160
Ye Xingwan,

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,840
you have made it through
all these years.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Do you still think you're a pure girl?

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
Your reputation

62
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
is already in ruins.

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,840
I've complied before,

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,760
and I've resisted too.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
Then you should try
a different approach.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,640
If you want to cooperate,

67
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
don't let him sense hostility.

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
If all you do is argue with him
face to face,

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,520
you'll gain nothing from it.

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Miss Ye,

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
I'll bet you this:

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
if something happens to you,

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,440
he'll completely lose control.

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,120
Yes.

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
I know exactly how people see me.

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,120
But if you cross my line,

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,120
I'll vanish for good.

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
For someone as capable as I am,

79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,880
if you lose me,

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
could you really bear that?

81
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
We've prepared for it for half a year.

82
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
We can't let her ruin it.

83
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,990
Help me see if there are any other girls

84
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,560
who can meet Xu Dashan's requirements.

85
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,520
- But...
- Just make it happen.

86
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Do you still think you're a pure girl?

87
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Your reputation

88
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
is already in ruins.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
(Gu Yixiao,)

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
(whether I'm clean or not,)

91
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,200
(you have no right to judge.)

92
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,840
(If I'm tainted,)

93
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
(you're a thousand times worse.)

94
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,520
(Trying to use Xu Dashan to corner me?)

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
(Then let's see how that plays out.)

96
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,980
(Ye Xingyue)

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,720
(Sis, you didn't come
to my show tonight?)

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,320
(Today's performance was a success.)

99
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,240
(Thank all the friends and family
who came to support me.)

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,560
(Because of you all,)

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,200
(my life is so beautiful.)

102
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,530
(In the end,)

103
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,960
(thank you, long-legged brother,
for the dress you gave me.)

104
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,600
Such a pure color

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,720
doesn't suit you.

106
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,660
(Xiao Qianyu)

107
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
Ye Xingwan,

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,800
are you pretending not to know me?

109
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,240
Qianyu,

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,960
long time no see.

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Here's the file on all employees.

112
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,080
Is there a suitable one?

113
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
It's quite a coincidence.

114
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,960
There's one
who meets Xu Dashan's requirements.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,440
Her name

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,120
is Xiao Qianyu.

117
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
Xiao Qianyu?

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
It sounds familiar.

119
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,040
Have you forgotten her?

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,440
Ye Xingwan's closest friend.

121
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
Her family runs the welfare home.

122
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,840
Her dad was tricked by Ye Qishan
and lost everything.

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,480
He crashed his car
while chasing Ye Qishan.

124
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,970
He's still lying in the hospital now.

125
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,640
Ye Xingwan's closest friend?

126
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,800
Any problem?

127
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,420
I can find another girl.

128
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
No need.

129
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
This matter

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,800
