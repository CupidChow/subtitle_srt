1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,800
Boss, we found it.

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,770
The fish chewed it down
to a pile of rotten bones.

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,960
Put this on him.

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,950
Then go file the report.

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,600
Also,

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
bribe their hourly worker.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
Put this USB drive

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,120
inside Ye Xingwan's teddy bear.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,080
Xingyue said,

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,600
that's her favorite toy.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,200
Yes.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
No one

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
can stop our career.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,100
=Half-awake=

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,060
=Episode 13=

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,940
(Chen Gang)

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Mr. Chu.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,400
How did it go?

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,780
She took back the personal items.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,240
She probably has known

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,320
what happened in the past.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
Mr. Gu,

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,120
can you just let me go?

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,760
Back then, you forced me
to do the accounts

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
and make the investments.

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,000
Now it is making money.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,720
You can't take all the profits, can you?

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,520
Besides,

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
It's him

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,720
who set me up.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
You can eat whatever you want,

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
but you mustn't talk nonsense.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,920
You joined voluntarily.

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,940
What's that got to do with me?

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,320
I do have ten million in my account.

37
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,040
But one million of that
belongs to my friend.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,440
That money really can't be touched.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,280
We can't?

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,160
It grew tenfold in just ten days.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Do you really believe

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
that in this world

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,080
there's such a perfect deal?

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,600
This is all a setup, isn't it?

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,440
You planned to drag me into this
from the start.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
I have no grudge or enmity against you.

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,240
Why are you trying to corner me?

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Yes,

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
you have no grudge against Mr. Gu.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
But your precious daughter

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
has crossed Mr. Gu.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
Mr. Gu,

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
I'm begging you, please.

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,760
You can take all my money.

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,940
But that money is my friend's.

56
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,320
I really can't touch it.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
How would I face him?

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,760
How would I face my kids?

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm already at this age.

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,650
I'll get on my knees for you.

61
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,530
Alright?

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,760
Alright?

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
Whether you can face them

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
has nothing to do with me.

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,640
I always thought

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,920
my dad owed him money,

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,600
so I had to pay it back for my dad.

68
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,960
Turns out

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
it was because of me.

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,120
He actually went to great lengths

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,160
to frame my dad
in order to get back at me.

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
My dad's money

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,680
was gone just like that.

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,160
When you see this video,

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,880
I'll already be out of Haishi.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't worry about me.

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,560
for you having such an unreliable

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,160
and useless father.

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
I've found out something.

81
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
I need to go confirm it.

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Xingwan,

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,480
I don't want to let you down again.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
And I won't let you get hurt.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,100
You have to be careful.

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,600
My sweet girl,

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,640
you're going to be

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,360
an incredible lawyer.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,080
I've always been proud of you.

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
This time, I want you

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
to be proud of me.

92
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,080
Dad,

93
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,040
I won't let the one who took your life

94
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,400
walk away free.

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,760
Trust me.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm going to end him.

97
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,600
Xingwan,

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
don't act on impulse.

99
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,320
That time when I got the call,

100
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,960
he reacted so nervously.

101
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,840
I suspected he knew
my dad was gone all along.

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,320
He must cause my dad's death.

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
How could I ever let him go?

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,760
Are you really going to ruin your life

105
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,320
for someone like him?

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
If something happens to you...

107
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
What will happen to Xingyue?

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,560
Calm down. Calm down.

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,360
I can't let you get hurt.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,520
But Yinan,

111
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,560
I can't accept this.

112
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,040
How could I let him go like this?

113
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
I know.

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
I won't let him walk free
without facing justice.

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,000
(This thread wasn't here before.)

116
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,580
(Teddy bear)

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
(This handwriting)

118
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
(doesn't look like Dad's.)

119
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
(Could it be someone else
wanted me to find the USB drive?)

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,880
Chu said you lived here.

121
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
So it's actually true.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Xingyue,

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,400
it's not what you think.

124
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Didn't you say

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
you have nothing to do with Yixiao?

126
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,160
I don't know how to explain this to you.

127
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,720
You've been lying to me all along.

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,760
No wonder you didn't let me see Yixiao.

129
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,440
No wonder you always speak ill of him.

130
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,960
You just want to possess him
for yourself.

131
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,120
Possess him?

132
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,440
I wish he would just disappear
from this world.

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,920
Xingyue,

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,880
everything I did was to protect you.

135
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,040
Stop making excuses for yourself.

136
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,640
You're as selfish as Dad.

137
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Fine.

138
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
Since you want to know,

139
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll tell you everything.

140
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,760
It was your dear Yixiao

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,560
who set Dad up,

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
caused Dad's death,

143
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,400
and drove Mom to her breaking point.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,890
Gu Yixiao

145
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,600
was the one behind it all.

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,640
What did you just say?

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,680
I said

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,720
Gu Yixiao caused Dad's death.

149
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,280
We have ended up in this situation

150
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,800
all because of Gu Yixiao.

151
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,040
No way.

152
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
You made all this up.

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm not buying it.

154
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,120
You just want me to give up on him.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
You're lying to me.

156
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,190
Do you know what I've been through

157
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,040
these past few years?

158
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,320
Why don't you go ask Gu Yixiao

159
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,360
what he's really done?

160
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,920
If I could, I'd rather lie to you
forever.

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,280
You'll have to face all of this
sooner or later.

162
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,800
Ye Xingwan,

163
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,120
you're a liar.

164
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm not buying anything you say.

165
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,260
(Xiao Qianyu)

166
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
Hello? Qianyu, what's going on?

167
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,160
Xingwan, Yinan can't be reached.

168
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,100
What did you just say?

169
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,280
Yinan said he won't let your life

170
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,360
be ruined by Gu Yixiao.

171
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,240
He's going to confront Gu Yixiao.

172
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,480
Now his phone's switched off.

173
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,740
(Ye Xingwan)

174
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,400
Ye Xingwan.

175
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,880
Where are you?

176
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,160
What's going on?

177
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,320
Right now, immediately,

178
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,720
send me your current location.

179
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,960
Send it to me now.

180
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,600
I'll send it to you.

181
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,720
Did she

182
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,960
find out something?

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,720
Are you worried
she's discovered something?

184
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,740
You sent someone to Ye Xingwan's place?

185
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
Let me ask you one more time.

186
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
How exactly did Ye Qishan die?

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Now,

188
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
it's been ruled an accident.

189
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,880
Chu Muzhi,

190
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
can I still

191
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,320
trust you?

192
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,600
Gu Yixiao,

193
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,320
I've fought by your side
for so many years.

194
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
And you still don't trust me.

195
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,280
Gu Group is a common cause for us all.

196
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
Exposing everything

197
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
won't do you any good.

198
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,660
Unless you want the situation

199
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,120
to get out of control,

200
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,990
so that I have a good reason

201
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,840
to completely get rid of her.

202
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
