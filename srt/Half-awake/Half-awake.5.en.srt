=Episode 5=

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,000
Gu Yixiao,

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,400
I've figured it out.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,480
Since you won't let me go,

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,960
and I'm destined to stay by your side,

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
then maybe starting now,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,960
I'll try to like you.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Really?

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
You're so obedient?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,440
What trick are you playing this time?

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,720
I'm not playing any tricks on you.

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,680
After what happened last night,

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm exhausted.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,480
I don't want to fight anymore.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,840
I just want life to be a little better.

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,800
Gu Yixiao,

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,840
if I learn to behave well,

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,250
can you treat me better?

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,520
Sure.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
Then let me see

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,160
how well you can behave.

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,040
What's wrong?

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,000
Getting scared now?

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
That's a pity.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,600
I don't like you at all.

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Gu Yixiao,

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,240
I know you like Xingyue.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
She's sweet,

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
sensible,

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
and obedient.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,960
But before I met you,

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,640
I was just like that too.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
Ye Xingwan,

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,240
don't use the tricks
you play on those men

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,880
to deal with me.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
Go ahead.

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,080
What's your goal this time?

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm serious this time.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
I don't want to be your socialite

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,550
used to curry favor
with the powerful anymore.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,880
I actually want to do real work.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,550
You want to get involved in my business?

44
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,120
I want you to see what I'm capable of.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,760
What I can offer you

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,480
is way more than you think.

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,160
I know the company's been planning

48
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,160
an acquisition of an e-sports club.

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,850
I can help you with that.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
I'll think about it.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
Then I'll stay here for now.

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
(Wang Yaqin was right.)

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,740
(To win someone over,
to win their heart.)

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,480
(This round,)

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,000
(I won.)

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,740
(Gu Group)

57
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,820
(Donghua University E-sports Club
Acquisition Project)

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,400
(Access restricted:
You have no permission)

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,880
(So this acquisition isn't
as simple as it looks.)

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
(But where should I)

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,520
(get this internal data?)

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
Don't be in such a rush.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,920
He's not so foolish

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,040
to let you just easily

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,800
find those key details.

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,380
Anyway,

67
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,420
I still want to thank you.

68
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,680
Otherwise, I wouldn't have noticed

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
this acquisition plan.

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,720
I have looked into a lot of information

71
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
and found no issues with this plan.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
So,

73
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,880
the only explanation I can think of

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
is money laundering.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
I've heard

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
about Xu Dashan's matter.

77
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,960
I've looked into you, Wang Yaqin.

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
Ever since Gu Group was founded,

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,990
you've been here all along,

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
doing the toughest and dirtiest jobs.

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,320
But you never leaves this building.

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,520
You even sleep in the storage room.

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
What kind of grudge
do you have against him?

84
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
That's none of your concern.

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,200
Since

86
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,440
you've already moved
into Gu Yixiao's villa,

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
that proves what I said was right.

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,280
Ever since I moved in,

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,520
he hasn't come back once.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,400
He's always been a cautious man.

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,680
For him,

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,400
you need to be more patient.

93
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,480
You're just a cleaner,

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,120
yet you know so much

95
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,550
about what happens around Gu Yixiao.

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,600
You're trying to get back at him.

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,240
Otherwise, why would you help me?

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,320
That doesn't matter.

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm helping you

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,520
because I don't want to see him
keep making mistakes.

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Maybe,

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,550
you can actually save him.

103
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
Miss Ye,

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
you know, between people,

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,280
there's more than just hate and pain.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,480
Try opening his heart.

107
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,040
Then you'll see a softer side

108
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
inside him.

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,000
If everything you said is true,

110
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,200
wouldn't that softness be his weakness?

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,880
Since you seem to know him so well,

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,440
can you tell me

113
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,440
what he actually likes?

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Mr. Chu,

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
you told me

116
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,200
I could get Miss Ye.

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160
But I ended up risking half my life.

118
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,730
And we're just letting that go?

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Mr. Xu,

120
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,880
this time, it was my fault.

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,260
This has nothing to do with Mr. Gu.

122
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll make up for your losses.

123
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Miss Ye,

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,120
I've been looking for you.

125
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,760
What do you want from me, Mr. Chu?

126
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,410
This is the acquisition proposal.

127
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,820
(E-sports Club Acquisition Proposal)

128
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,250
Mr. Gu asked me to give it to you.

129
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
Don't be so proud.

130
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,160
This is just the beginning.

131
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,680
What do you mean by that, Mr. Chu?

132
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,520
Stop pretending it.

133
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,400
I know exactly what's on your mind.

134
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,880
And I know what you're planning to do.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
Right back at you.

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,630
If I told him about your plotting

137
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,490
with Xu Dashan,

138
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,600
what do you think

139
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,640
he would do?

140
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
Then I'll keep a close eye on you.

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
Let's wait and see.

142
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,300
(Teaching Building)

143
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Ivan.

144
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,860
(Xiao Yinan)

145
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,720
You know who I am?

146
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,640
Captain of Dongda E-sports Team.

147
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,880
Winner of the LVP National Finals.

148
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,280
Hot favorite
for the next world championship.

149
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,880
A true prodigy.

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm the secretary of Gu Group,

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,240
Ye Xingwan.

152
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,880
We need to talk in private.

153
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
What do you mean by that?

154
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
Exactly what it sounds like.

155
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
Our group plans to acquire your team.

156
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,740
Winning isn't the only goal.

157
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,560
There's also a business purpose
behind it.

158
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
As the captain,

159
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,570
you'll need to help us
recruit new talent,

160
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,480
and expand the lineup.

161
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,680
As for our financial accounts,

162
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
during the review,

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,040
just keep quiet, alright?

164
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
You're breaking the law.

165
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,880
Why do you think I'd help you guys?

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
If you have any terms, just say them.

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
You want money

168
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
or something else?

169
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,240
What if I say no?

170
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,720
I don't want the team
I built from scratch

171
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
to become someone's tool.

172
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
Don't be so sure just yet.

173
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,080
Human nature cannot withstand tests.

174
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,040
When you say that,

175
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,550
you're basically admitting our offer

176
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,600
wasn't tempting enough.

177
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,600
Is that so?

178
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,990
So how much temptation
are you going to give me?

179
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
What if I say

180
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,600
what I want is you?

181
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,440
So young,

182
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
yet with quite a lot of ideas.

183
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
I never imagined

184
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,380
the person who once got into
Donghua University's Faculty of Law,

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
determined to become a lawyer,

186
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
would now be asking me
to commit a crime with her.

187
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
How do you know?

188
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
