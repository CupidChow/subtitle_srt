00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,380
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Xingwan,

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,560
you're back.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,480
Come sit with me.

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,200
Please?

7
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,310
Xingwan,

8
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,230
I don't have a mom anymore.

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,690
I never got to see her one last time.

10
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,390
When I got to the hospital,

11
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,040
she was lying there, completely still.

12
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
So quiet.

13
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
It's exactly like the way she was

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,160
when I was little - very gentle.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,160
But her body,

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
her body was cold as ice.

17
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,600
She'll never speak again.

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,480
From now on,

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,840
whether it's love or hate,

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,920
there's no way for me
to make peace with her.

21
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
I've lost my chance.

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,680
I'll never get another chance again.

23
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,160
This is for you.

24
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,560
Go on, open it.

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,240
See if you like it.

26
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
The first wish.

27
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
Gu Yixiao gives me a white dress.

28
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
The second wish.

29
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
Gu Yixiao takes me
to the amusement park.

30
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,800
The third wish.

31
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,360
Gu Yixiao says he loves me.

32
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
You made a wish on your birthday

33
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,840
that you want a white dress.

34
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,920
So I bought it for you.

35
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,760
You also said

36
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,220
you wanted to go to the amusement park.

37
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
Tomorrow.

38
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
Tomorrow, I'll take you there.

39
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
How does that sound?

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
Xingwan,

41
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,880
don't ignore me.

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
I still remember every wish
you ever made.

43
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,800
Every single one of them.

44
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
I know.

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,240
I know how much

46
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,480
I hurt you before.

47
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,840
But now,

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
you're all I have left.

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
Let's start over.

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,960
Let's build a new home together.

51
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Xingwan,

52
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
will you marry me?

53
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
Do you love me?

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,880
I love you.

55
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,080
Of course I love you.

56
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,280
But I don't love you.

57
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,280
That's OK.

58
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
I don't need you to love me back.

59
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,520
I just hope

60
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
you'll stay with me.

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
Alright.

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
I promise you.

63
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
Put on this ring.

64
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
From now on, you belong to me.

65
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,440
Xingwan,

66
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,800
we're going to be together forever.

67
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,000
Always.

68
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,840

69
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,840
(you'll never truly understand)

70
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,400
(I could never love you.)

71
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
I'll kneel for you, alright?

72
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm kneeling for you.

It can't read any data now.

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,070
Got any ideas to fix it?

85
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,280
It's damaged pretty badly.

86
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
I'll try to fix it.

87
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,040
This should hold something important.

88
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,800
You must keep this a secret.

89
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,460
Don't breathe a word to anyone.

90
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
During this period,

91
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,220
you need to be careful too.

92
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,820
Make sure nothing happens to you.

93
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,800
Xingwan,

94
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
I saw it trending online.

95
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
Are you really marrying him?

96
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,140
(Wedding Invitation:
Ye Xingwan Gu Yixiao)

97
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
Get lost!

98
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,780
(All set?)

99
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,270
(Relax. We hacked Miss Ye's phone
to send the message.)

100
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,100
(He believes it was Ye Xingwan
who asked him.)

101
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
Congratulations.

102
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,440
You're about to become Mrs. Gu.

103
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
Chu Muzhi,

104
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
don't pretend to be nice.

105
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
You're probably the last person

106
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,800
who'd want to see this happen.

107
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,200
You wouldn't have come

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,520
just to mock me, would you?

109
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,800
Of course not.

110
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,840
I came to discuss a deal with you.

111
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,720
I told you before,

112
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,640
I'd never make a deal with you.

113
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,000
Mr. Gu, this way please.

114
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,840
Gu Yixiao now

115
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,280
trusts me completely.

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
Whatever I want,

117
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,120
he'll give it to me.

118
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,080
Then what exactly are you offering?

119
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,680
Wang Yaqin gave me something.

120
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,320
Among them,

121
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,200
there's a portable hard drive.

122
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,720
(Gu Yixiao,)

123
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,600
(when you find out what
this woman's done,)

124
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,480
(what choice will you make?)

125
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,400
Gu Yixiao never imagined

126
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
that the woman about to become his wife

127
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
was wishing for his death every moment.

128
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
But that's not enough.

129
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,840
I want this too.

130
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,960
What's that?

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,160
It's with Gu Yixiao?

132
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,680
No idea.

133
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
That's why I need you to confirm it.

134
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,560
It's such a tiny thing.

135
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,770
Where am I supposed to find it?

136
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
That depends on your skills.

137
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,240
And you?

138
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,920
What do you want?

139
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
All these years,

140
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,840
you've done so many things together.

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,960
There's no way there's zero evidence.

142
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
Where are the backups
for all that stuff?

143
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,000
Gu Yixiao's villa has a safe.

144
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,140
He doesn't let anyone get close to it.

145
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
Everything that matters to him

146
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,520
is kept inside.

147
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,800
And the code?

148
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,840
No idea.

149
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,240
Good luck with that.
