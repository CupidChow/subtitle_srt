00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,700
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,280
Gu Yixiao,

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,240
let me go.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,280
You're not going anywhere.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,520
Ye Xingwan,

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,880
you told me so many things.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,840
Which of them were true,

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,680
and which were lies?

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,760
After all these years,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,560
after everything that's happened,

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,160
you're still asking
such a stupid question.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,900
Under Wang Yaqin's influence,

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,040
you approached me deliberately,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,100
and pretended to please me.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,540
For a while, I actually thought
you meant it.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,920
Turns out

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,360
you really wanted me gone.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,400
Why?

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,900
Why did you ever appear in my life?

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,640
Why

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,280
did you make me fall for you?

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,360
Gu Yixiao,

24
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,370
stop losing control like this
every time.

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
That look on your face makes me sick.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
Ever since the day I met you,

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
my life has completely fallen apart.

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,440
It's you.

29
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,320
Your appearance

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,760
turned me into who I am now.

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,320
Ye Xingwan,

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,840
whether in life or death,

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,960
I want you by my side.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,810
It's what you owe me.

35
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,770
Get a grip, will you?

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
I don't owe you anything.

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,120
I never owed you.

38
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,970
Did you forget?

39
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,840
I didn't forget.

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,510
Do you want to hear

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,840
a different version of the story?

42
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,260
You probably don't know this.

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,440
My younger sister

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,980
is allergic to apples.

45
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,990
One year during the Mid-Autumn Festival,

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,000
our neighbor, the lady next door,

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,460
insisted on giving Xingyue an apple.

48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,760
She didn't want to eat it,

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,480
so she left home by herself,

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,240
and ran to an open field.

51
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,440
She planned to throw it away.

52
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,200
Hey, do you want an apple?

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
When I finally found her,

54
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,280
she was inside an old, run-down
factory building.

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,360
She gave that apple

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,640
to a little boy covered in dirt.

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,720
Sis, this boy's hurt.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,200
I gave him my apple.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
Will that make him better?

60
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,480
I didn't want her to get too close
to strangers.

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,660
Then I took her away quickly.

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,830
How many times has Mom
told you already

63
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,160
that don't talk to strangers?

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,880
Come on, let's get home.

65
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
Look, it's already dark.

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,540
Why are you running around?

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,520
Don't do that anymore. Got it?

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,320
I didn't run around.

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,290
Still trying to argue.

70
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,990
Mom will deal with you back home.
Come on.

71
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,800
That guy has no idea we're playing him.

72
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,140
And he's still staying there.

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,670
After it's done, dump him in the sea.

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,880
No one knows him anyway.

75
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,840
On the way, we heard a group talking.

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,440
They said they were going
to deal with that kid.

77
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,040
Throw him into the sea for the sharks.

78
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,770
What are you talking about?

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,880
I was so scared
that I rushed back with Xingyue

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,770
and called the police.

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
But I didn't expect the police

82
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,040
to take that little boy away too.

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,200
I tried to explain to them

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,760
that the boy was actually a victim.

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
But they didn't listen.

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,960
I could only watch helplessly

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
as that little boy

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,960
was pushed into the police car.

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,680
Stop twisting the truth!

90
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
Still making up stories, aren't you?

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,080
You should be grateful to me.

92
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,680
If I hadn't called the police,

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
you would've died there with your dad.

94
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,000
Enough, Ye Xingwan!

95
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,600
You still dare to lie to me!

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,080
Gu Yixiao,

97
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,120
the one thing I regret most
all these years

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,000
is making that call

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
and saving you.

100
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,360
I should've just let you
fend for yourself.

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,370
You're talking nonsense.

102
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,480
That's nonsense.

103
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,960
That's not how it is.

104
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
That's not the truth.

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
Gu Yixiao, do you even know?

106
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,840
You can't save your dad at all.

107
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,640
Your so-called deal is a joke.

108
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,280
Your revenge is nothing but a joke.

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560

completely and utterly,

113
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,600

to drop out of school.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,820

(Teaching Building)

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,520
I still remember when I was 13,

144
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,840
the first time I met Yixiao.

145
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,040
It was at our mom's funeral.

146
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,160
She jumped from a tall building.

147
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,960
Yet we didn't get a cent
from her insurance.

148
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
A crowd of people came to collect debts.

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,560
I was terrified.

150
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,160
I hid behind you, crying.

151
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,600
Then,

152
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,320
he appeared.

153
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
Like a prince out of nowhere,

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
he is so gentle.

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,160
He told me,

156
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
"Xingyue,

157
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,600
from now on, I'll treat you well.

158
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,360
I won't let anyone hurt you."

159
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
All these years,

160
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
he's really been good to me.

161
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I even thought,

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,040
one day I'd marry him.

163
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,840
Turns out it was all a lie.

164
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,640
From the start, it was just an illusion.

165
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,800
If I hadn't gone to his villa that day,

166
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,240
were you planning to hide it
from me forever,

167
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,120
letting me treat my enemy

168
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,080
like my love?

169
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
It won't be forever.

170
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Because

171
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
we will send him to prison.

172
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Prison?

173
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Sis,

174
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
that's your plan, not mine.

175
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
If you want revenge, count me out.

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,480
It's been a while since we met.

177
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
You seem different now.

178
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
At first I thought

179
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
you helping me against Gu Yixiao

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
was to take him down,

181
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,460
so that you could finally
set yourself free.

182
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,040
But ever since I learned
about your relationship,

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,330
I started to understand something.

184
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,600
You wanted to use me

185
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,920
to make up for what you owed him.

186
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,080
If Gu Yixiao ever found out

187
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,440
that his own mother

188
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,920
betrayed him once again,

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
he'd probably hate you so much

190
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,520
that he'd wish you were gone instantly.

191
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
Actually,

192
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
it's not just that.

193
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
Miss Ye,

194
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,080
I did it for you too.

195
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,680
My son

196
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
is ruthless when he acts,

197
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,960
but he has one fatal flaw.

198
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,680
He trusts too much in what he sees.

199
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,880
That's why he ended up

200
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
on this path of revenge.

201
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
But he's not happy at all.

202
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,080
I know.

203
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,360
What's that got to do with me?

204
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,200
Are you happy now?

205
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,040
So basically,

206
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,360
revenge doesn't bring happiness.

207
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,320
I want him to realize the truth.

208
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
I hope he can find again

209
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,000
the ability to love someone.

210
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,440
If we can pull him out of that abyss,

211
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,720
it'll be a relief for you too.

212
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,040
Relief?

213
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,680
My parents will never come back to life.

214
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,520
And the five years I lost are gone too.

215
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
Wang Yaqin,

216
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,840
don't make it sound prettier than it is.

217
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,440
If you really want to pull us

218
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
out from that abyss,

219
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,520
then you have to keep helping me.

220
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,000
Make sure he pays for it in prison.

221
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,280
Back then,

222
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
it was for revenge

223
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,840
that I became the person I am today.

224
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
I don't want you to end up like me.

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,320
You're right.

226
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
This isn't what I wanted,

227
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,920
but I have to keep going.

228
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
Miss Ye,

229
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,680
don't make the same mistake again.

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Yixiao.

231
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,520
Yixiao!

232
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,880
Yixiao!

233
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,420
What happened to your hand?

234
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
I went to the prison,

235
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,840
and saw the ones

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,400
who caused my dad's death.

237
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,520
Yixiao.

238
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,760
Muzhi,

239
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,760

240
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,690

your whole life

241
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,200

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
