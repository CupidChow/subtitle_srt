1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,520
I've already looked into it.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,200
That sly old fox, Mr. Lu,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,780
(Chu Muzhi)
wants to control Ye Xingwan

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
and found evidence of our trap.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,560
Ye Xingwan hurt herself.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,100
That's how she managed to escape.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,360
I told you before

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,520
every move Ye Xingwan makes

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,200
must be under our watch.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,590
You were in charge that day, right?

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,960
Mr. Gu, it was my failure.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,220
I deserve to be punished.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
It's fine.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,800
Just take your punishment.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,120
Mr. Gu, I was wrong. Mr. Gu.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,200
Please forgive me, Mr. Gu.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,480
I was wrong, Mr. Gu.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,400
Please forgive me, Mr. Gu.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
Mr. Gu...

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,720
Where's Lu?

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,320
I've already dealt with him.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,800
That crafty old man

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,380
got so scared that he could barely move.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,880
He dared to cross you.

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,400
He should've known what was coming.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,880
How's Ye Xingwan?

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
I've followed you for so many years,

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
and it's the first time I've seen

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,360
you care about her.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,160
What's going on?

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,200
What I care about is not her life,

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,080
but that she cannot escape my control.

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,440
Every bit of pain she feels
can only be given by me,

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,720
inflicted slowly by me.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
No one else is allowed.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,220
Glad you haven't forgotten.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,360
After all, your dad

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
died because of her.

(Five years ago)

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,240
Let go of my mom!

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,680
What are you doing?

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Who are you people?

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Breaking into my home, what do you want?

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,640
You don't recognize me?

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
He is the president of Gu Group.

(Donghua University Letter of Admission)

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,480
Ye Xingwan.

Donghua University.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
Law Major.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Seems your father, Ye Qishan,

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,760
has raised

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
a smart and well-mannered daughter.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
Since you're so brave,

56
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
why don't you tell me

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,560
how this debt should be repaid

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,260
after your father ran away

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
owing me a hundred million?

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
One hundred million?

61
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,060
(Ye's mother)

62
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,680
It is only right for a daughter

63

(Letter of Admission)

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,060
to repay her father's debts.

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,240
Tell me, shouldn't you be the one

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
to repay this debt for him?

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
Keep dreaming.

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,140
You broke into my home.

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,320
And you even hurt someone.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm calling the police on you.

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Call the police?

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
Go ahead.

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Hand her the phone.

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,040
Call the police.

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Your sister...

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,620
She's still in middle school, right?

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,800
Her name's Ye Xingyue.

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,680
She studies at Bihai Middle School.

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,920
Xingyue...

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Xingwan,

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
no, no.

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,900
Don't call the police.

83
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,120
Don't call the police.

84
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't call the police.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
If you want something, come at me.

86
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Stay away from my sister.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Make the call to drop out of school.

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
From now on, you'll do what I say.

89
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,900
You're smart.

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
You should know what you're worth.

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
If you just follow orders,

92
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
I'll naturally

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,360
let your family go.

94
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
What value do I have?

95
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,280
Of course you have.

96
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
It's just a pity

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,760
you'll never wear
that school uniform again.

98
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,980
Sis.

99
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Sis, you're awake.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
Come on.

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
What's wrong with me?

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,480
The cut on your hand got infected.

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
You've had a high fever
and been out cold for days.

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
Sis,

105
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,520
I really need to say this to you.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Don't mess around outside every day.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,640
You're Yixiao's secretary now.

108
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,040
Even if you don't care about yourself,

109
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
at least don't embarrass him.

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
Embarrass?

111
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,020
Then why do you think Gu Yixiao

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,680
keeps letting his secretary

113
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,880
fall into such a messy state

114
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
and lose all self-respect?

115
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,960
You're saying Yixiao's
not a good guy, right?

116
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm grown now.

117
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,440
I can see things clearly
with my own eyes.

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
Sis,

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,240
I don't know what happened
between you and Yixiao.

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
But all these years

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
he's really been good to us.

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,240
I honestly like him a lot.

123
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,160
You'd also want me

124
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,400
to find happiness, right?

125
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
You want to see me?

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
You told her to come to my room?

127
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,720
I didn't know that Wang Yaqin...

128
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,080
Don't mention her name.

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,360
Sorry.

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,920
Yixiao,

131
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
these past few years,

132
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
your attitude toward Ye Xingwan

133
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,600
has changed a lot.

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,200
Yixiao.

135
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,780
(Wang Qi: Find out?
Is my dad's death related to him?)

136
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm begging you.

137
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,140
We haven't eaten or had water
for three days.

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720

(Young Gu Yixiao)
I'll do whatever you ask.

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,400
Deliver this package

142
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,800
to the warehouse at Pier 19.

143
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,680
Once you get it done,

144
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,800
all past debts will be cleared.

145
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,240
If there is even the slightest damage

146
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,400
to anything in here,

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll make sure your dad

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,960
