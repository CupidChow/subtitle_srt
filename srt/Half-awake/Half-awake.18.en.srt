=Episode 18=

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,160
Mr. Gu,

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,980
the discharge paperwork is done.

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,300
(Ye Xingwan)

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,840
Gu Yixiao, help me!

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,000
Someone's following me.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,280
Where are you right now?

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,440
I...

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,880
I'm heading towards the dock.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,720
Ye Xingwan.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,800
Ye Xingwan.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
Mr. Gu.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Hurry, tell Mr. Chu.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,320
Who sent you here?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Don't shout.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,440
Stay right here.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Ye Xingwan!

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,400
Don't move.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,680
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
Put that down.

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
Gu Yixiao.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
Watch out.

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Are you OK?

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
I'm fine.

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Gu Yixiao!

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Are you alright?

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
What happened?

29
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,480
You got here just in time.

30
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
Let's go.

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
Clean this up.

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,240
Behave yourself.

33
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
Let me help you.

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
You're worried about me.

35
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
So you've forgiven me?

36
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
You saved me

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,960
and got hurt because of me.

38
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,680
It's what I should do.

39
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm glad

40
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
when you're in danger,

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,640
you'd think of me right away.

42
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,880
I just figured

43
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,720
you're better at fighting.

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Xingwan,

45
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,520
I've been working so hard for you.

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
How about you consider

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,440
to be with me?

48
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,040
For the hurt I caused you before,

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,260
please give me a chance
to make it up to you.

50
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,680
That's not the same thing.

51
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,370
You saved me,

52
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,660
and I'm really grateful for that,

53
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,600
but that doesn't mean I can forgive
what you did.

54
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Then tell me

55
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
what I have to do

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
for you to forgive me.

57
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,480
I'll do whatever you ask.

58
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I want to take over
the Mingfu Foundation account.

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
You know,

60
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,080
that account

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,680
is the lifeline of Gu Group.

62
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,720
Once you get hold of the core details,

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
you could send me to prison

64
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
at any moment.

65
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
But

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
if you want it,

67
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,990
I'm willing to give it to you.

68
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,300
(VIP Room)

69
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,100
I've rounded up a batch of clients.

70
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,920
They don't track their cash flow
closely.

71
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
We'll use their accounts
for the transfers.

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,900
It shouldn't be a problem.

73
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,460
It's just that the futures market
has been unstable lately.

74
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,260
All the client profiles are right here.

75
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,640
Do you need to review them?

76
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
No need.

77
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,880
Destroy them as soon as possible.

78
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Miss Ye.

79
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Sign here.

80
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
Me?

81
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,480
Miss Ye,

82
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,420
you know,

83
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
investment is,

84
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
to some extent, risky.

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,860
Put all rights and duties in writing

86
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,320
is protection for both sides.

87
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,960
Rights and duties? Really?

88
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,380
It's just keeping leverage
on each other.

89
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,000
If trouble comes later,

90
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,800
no one's getting away.

91
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,920
If you don't want to sign, then don't.

92
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,960
No need to force it.

93
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,660
(Ye)

94
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
That's enough, right?

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Relax.

96
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,830
I'll deal with it
as soon as possible.

97
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,920
What are you doing?

98
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
You really are father and daughter.

99
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
Same tactics every time.

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,140
You always use the same move.

101
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
This is your usual trick, isn't it?

102
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
Investing under someone else's name,

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,880
then selling and turning it into cash.

104
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,640
Wasn't my dad also tricked

105
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,920
by you guys back then?

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,360
Only now you've made it harder to trace.

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
Those people on the list

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
don't even know it themselves.

109
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
Without a clue,

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
they've become tools
for someone's schemes.

111
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,040
Now we're stuck in this together.

112
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
Don't try to pull any stunts.

113
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,600
I just want to know

114
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,680
what you mean by that last thing
you said.

115
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,560
My dad and I use the same tactics.

116
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,880
He also made recordings?

117
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
So,

118
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
you gave that USB drive

119
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,360
to me on purpose,

120
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
