00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,240
It seems

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,160
you've never cried like this
in front of me before.

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,520
Want to hear my story?

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,280
My father

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
is an honest, decent man.

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,640
But when I was 13,

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,960
he got tangled up in a brutal debt.

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,660
The collectors locked both of us

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,000
inside a warehouse.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
They tormented us
for three days straight.

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,840
When he was barely hanging on,

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,400
they handed me a bag.

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
They said, as long as I took it

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,600
to the contact,

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,440
they'd let me go.

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,760
I clutched that bag,

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,800
running as hard as I could,

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,720
stumbling and falling over and over.

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,140
I was covered in bruises after the fall.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
But what worried me more

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,940
was whether the stuff in my bag
got smashed up.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
When I unzipped my bag,

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
guess

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
what I saw inside.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
White powder.

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
Packets of white powder.

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
I didn't make a sound,

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880
and just stuffed it all back in,

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
dragging myself to the meeting spot.

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Back then,

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
I was staring across the pier,

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,840
at the warm lights in someone's home.

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,480
And me,

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,000
I was battered all over,

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
hiding in the shadows,

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,080
clutching a bag of white powder.

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,040
I thought I was ridiculous.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,400
Time slipped away without me noticing.

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,120
I felt like I was about to die.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,280
Right at that moment,

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
a little girl appeared in front of me.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,840
She handed me an apple.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,360
Hey, do you want this apple?

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,080
Do you remember now?

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,400
I was that boy in the warehouse
back then.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,880
Later on,

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
I never met the contact person.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,480
Instead, the police showed up.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
When the police took me away,

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,250
my father was left
in the corner of the warehouse

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
like garbage,

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,920
lying there alone all night

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
until he died.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
You called the police,

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
didn't you?

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
Now I finally understand

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,320
why you held Xingyue in your hands

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,040
all these years

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,000
while trampling me in the mud.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,180
You're getting back at me
for calling the police

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,520
and preventing you
from saving your dad.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes.

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,800
I called the police back then.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
But it was because
they were going to kill you.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,960
I did it to save you.

68
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,440
Stop twisting the truth, Ye Xingwan.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
You think I'd ever believe you?

I'll make you walk through this with me.

I use you, step over you,

78
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,660
and make sure you can never
leave me.

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800

Wang Yaqin, what happened?

189
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Wang Yaqin.

190
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
Wang Yaqin.

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
Wang Yaqin.

192
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,080
Hurry, get her to the hospital.

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,920
Gu Yixiao.

194
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,760
She's my mother.

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,360
You're not surprised?

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,120
I guessed it.

197
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
I hate her.

198
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,170
That's why I arranged the best care
for her.

199
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,720
No matter what it takes,

200
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
I still want her to live.

201
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,280
When someone dies,

202
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,080
it can be the fastest escape.

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,560
But I want her to live,

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,080
for as long as possible.

205
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,760
Now you know.

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
You can go.

207
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,560
Gu Yixiao,

208
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
I told you before,

209
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
I'll stay by your side.

210
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
No matter what happens.

211
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
It's me.

212
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,320
Help me with something.

213
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
(Ye Xingwan,)

214
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,080
(you pushed me to this.)

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,560
(I can't watch Gu Yixiao
fall for your tricks.)

216
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,710
(It's time)

217
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,360
