1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,520
You're right.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,610
This isn't what I wanted,

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,120
but I have to keep going.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,920
Miss Ye,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,040
don't make the same mistake again.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,880
Xingwan,

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,920
I was not capable enough.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
I couldn't help you.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
You've already done a lot for me.

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,680
Those files I gave you the other day,

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,080
have you read them?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,080
They were all videos
about the Honey Trap.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,480
But there wasn't any solid evidence.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,590
What exactly did he force them to do?

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,040
It's similar to the terms you offered me

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,520
when you bought that E-sports Club.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
They're all about accounting issues.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
Such large-scale transactions,

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,960
there must be something off
in his cash flow.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,840
Yet somehow, it's never been uncovered.

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,280
He must have someone
inside the foundation company.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,160
Yinan,

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
you're majored in computer science,
right?

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,360
Then can you try to apply for

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
an internship at the Mingfu Foundation?

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,840
I'll give it a shot.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,700
=Half-awake=

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,660
=Episode 16=

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
What did the hospital say?

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,640
She's awake,

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,590
but still can't get out of bed.

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Then drag her out if you have to.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,560
Today's my dad's death anniversary.

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
She always repents on this day.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
This year can't be an exception.

36
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,560
There's one more thing.

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,840
Xiao Yinan wants to intern
at the Mingfu Foundation.

38
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,540
Should we reject his application?

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
No need.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
I actually want to see

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,680
what exactly he is trying to do.

42
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,270
I'm heading to the nightclub.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,320
Let me go with you.

44
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
No need.

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,320
You go to the hospital.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,480
Keep an eye on that woman.

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
I'll go by myself.

48
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Good.

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,240
Miss Ye, you can hold your liquor well.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,560
Since I invited you

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,320
and a few friends to come here for fun,

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,180
I must ensure that you are satisfied.

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,600
You invite me here especially today.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,040
It's not just to share
a couple of drinks, huh?

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,080
If you need my help,

56
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,360
you can just say it.

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,480
I heard

58
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,720
the police have been stricter recently.

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,400
The accounts of Gu Group

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,830
have always been under your control.

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
I wonder...

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Mr. Gu,

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,280
long time no see.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,480
Can't you tell?

66
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
Working, of course.

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Mr. Gu, I'm really sorry.

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,700
I didn't know you'd be here too.

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,480
Get out.

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,280
Got it.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Come home with me.

72
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
When you ordered me around before,

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
you never cared how I felt.

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Let go.

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,200
Come home with me.

76
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Gu Yixiao.

77
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,120
Gu Yixiao, what are you doing?

78
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,160
Xingwan,

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,200
we need to talk.

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,920
About what?

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I was wrong.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,880
Give me a chance to make things right.

83
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Make things right?

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,690
And how exactly will you do that?

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
Be with me.

86
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's start over.

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
Gu Yixiao,

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,840
don't you think that's ridiculous?

89
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Being together or not

90
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,080
has to be your call, doesn't it?

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,200
Xingwan, you once said

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,240
you wanted to be mine.

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
But you also said

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,480
you didn't have feelings for me.

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Isn't that true?

96
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,560
I said so because...

97
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,280
You didn't like me,
so you pulled me down

98
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,200
destroyed everything I had,

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,360
and made me do

100
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,120
those most degrading things.

101
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
So now you say you like me.

102
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,160
Does that mean I have to say yes?

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,920
It's not like that.

104
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
Xingwan,

105
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,840
I was wrong about what happened before.

106
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,920
It was all my fault.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
But from now on,

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
I will make up for you a hundredfold.

109
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Please, believe me.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
If you can forgive me,

111
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,440
I'll agree to whatever you ask.

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,240
Really?

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,080
Anything at all.

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,760
Alright.

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,960
Then go to hell.

116
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
Would you dare?

117
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,120
I've kept

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,240
this knife all these years.

119
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,640
It's my last line.

120
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,640
Whenever someone pushes too far,

121
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,600
I use it as a reminder to myself.

122
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
Pain is the price I pay.

123
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,060
It's also the line others can't cross.

124
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,120
It reminds me

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,880
to hold the line, never compromise.

126
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,200
Now,

127
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,880
show me.

128
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
Didn't you say you'd do anything for me?

129
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,360
If you can prove it,

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,600
I'll believe

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,560
that your remorse is real.

132
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,520

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,160
If you had just given me an answer once,

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,360
you could've fixed everything sooner.

147
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
But you never did.

then go to hell

Yue, I've told you so many times

163
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,800
that don't talk to strangers.

164

166
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,000
Mom,

167
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,200
why did you leave me behind?

168
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,760
Your mom gave up on you long ago.

169
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,560
No, that's impossible.

170
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,800
No one will ever love you.

171
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,680
That's not true, you're lying.

172
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,320
You shouldn't have been born.

173
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,800
Your birth was a mistake.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,840
No.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,960
That's not true.

176
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,600
That's not true.

177
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
You shouldn't have been born.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
That's not true.

179
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,460

180
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,720
You shouldn't have been born.

181
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,760
That's not true.

182
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,100
Your birth was a mistake.

183
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,240
You shouldn't have been born.

No one will ever love you.

187
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,640
That's not true.

188
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
That's not true.

189
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,340
