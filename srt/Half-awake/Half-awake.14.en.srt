1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,880
Gu Yixiao.

2
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,120
Watch out!

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,380
=Half-awake=

4
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 14=

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,240
Stop that!

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,600
Stop!

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,720
That's enough!

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,440
Stop it, Gu Yixiao.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm begging you.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,440
Stop.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Gu Yixiao.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,200
Stop.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
What?

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Feeling sorry now?

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Xingwan,

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
don't plead with him.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,960
Still acting tough.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,560
Tell me

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,640
if an e-sports player's hands
are ruined,

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,360
what will happen?

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,280
You went all out

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
to protect this guy

23
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
and fight me.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
I did it for my dad.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
My dad's death

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,880
is tied to you.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Is that so?

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,040
You suspect me?

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,960
If you really suspect me,

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,680
why did you save me just now?

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
Since you saved me,

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
why turn around and hurt me?

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,760
You charged in without hesitation.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Was that for him

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,840
or was it for me?

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,240
Say it.

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Say it.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
You're awake.

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,880
Stay put right here.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,520
You caused my dad's death.

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,000
I have nothing to say to you.

42
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,360
I didn't cause your dad's death.

43
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,400
Back then, he owed me money.

44
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,990
He couldn't repay and disappeared.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,680
We only learned the rest together later.

46
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,780
I admit I pressed him too hard
back then.

47
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,120
But I never meant to hurt him.

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Now the truth is clear.

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,440
It was an accident.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Ye Xingwan,

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,560
you indirectly caused my dad's death.

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,760
I indirectly caused yours.

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
We're even now.

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,800
Gu Yixiao,

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,320
stop twisting the truth.

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,760
Your dad borrowed
the high-interest loan himself.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
He got what he deserved.

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,380
My dad was trapped and killed
because of you.

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,480
You're a killer.

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,880
Stop pretending to be innocent.

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm just telling the truth.

62
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,660
Do you know why my dad owed loan sharks?

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,840
It was because of Wang Yaqin.

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,440
Wang Yaqin and that man she was seeing

65
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,200
set my dad up.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
Just like you set me up.

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,790
Stop dumping all your misery

68
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,680
on others.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,840
You've got no right to judge anyone.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
I've been way too patient with you.

71
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,610
No one's ever made me

72
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,920
this patient.

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
Since the moment I dragged you in,

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,440
you've had only two choices.

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
Either get on my boat

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,280
or drown.

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Which will it be?

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm not picking either.

79
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
Why could a devil like you

80
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,760
still get to walk free?

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
If I had to choose,

82
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,260
I'd choose to see you behind bars.

83
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,400
Alright.

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,120
Good.

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
From this moment on,

86
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,380
you're staying right here

87
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,230
and think it through,

88
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,580
until you make your decision.

89
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,280
I made a vow.

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,920
In this era of survival of the fittest,

91
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I will become a predator.

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,960
And you can't escape me.

93
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,580
(Xia Yiwen)

94
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,380
(Ding Shaoyan)

95
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,960
There's no one more suitable?

96
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,360
Yixiao.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,640
I heard you're looking for a secretary.

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,320
Do you think I can do it?

99
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,320
Stop messing around, Xingyue.

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,680
You're still a student.

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,040
How could you dress like this?

102
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,360
When my sister were at my age,

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
didn't she dress the same way?

104
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
So why can't I?

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,200
Yixiao,

106
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,040
do you like my sister?

107
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
Yixiao,

108
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
my sister doesn't like you.

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,160
She told me

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,520
that you caused my dad's death.

111
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,040
See? My sister lied to me.

112
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,520
She slandered you.

113
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
Xingyue,

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,220
your sister didn't lie to you.

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,840
It was indeed me,

116
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,680
who indirectly caused your dad's death.

117
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,040
Liar...

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
You lied to me.

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,600
You all lied to me.

120
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Stay away from me.

121
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,400
Follow her.

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,680
Don't let her wander off.

123
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,520
Why didn't you respond
to Xingyue's question?

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,560
Which question?

125
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you have feelings for Ye Xingwan?

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
That's not important.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,080
But she's fated to be tangled up
with me till the end.

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,280
Stop lying to yourself.

129
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,400
She already knows the truth.

130
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,800
And you're still keeping her around.

131
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
You think locking her in the villa

132
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
will make her truly yours?

133
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Ye Xingwan poses no threat to us.

134
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,160
And I will never have feelings for her.

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Alright.

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,280
So, have you not

137
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,360
had the slightest doubt

138
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
about what she has done
these days?

139
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,320
So, have you not

140
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,880
had the slightest doubt

141
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,080
about what she has done
these days?

142
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,780
(Files;

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Gu Yixiao, let me out of here.

144
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,040
You're not going anywhere.

145

Ye Xingwan,

146
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,840
you've told me so many things.

147
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,800
Which of them were real?

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
