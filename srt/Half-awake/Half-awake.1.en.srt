00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,740
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,560
(Gu Yixiao,)

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,000
(it's been five years.)

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,160
(I work myself to death
with my body for you,)

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,120
(selling my charms
to entice the powerful,)

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,880
(trading dirty interests for you.)

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,040
(You stand in glory, untouchable,)

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,560
(yet I am despised by everyone.)

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,200
(All of this...)

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,320
(I've had enough.)

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,220
(Ye Xingwan)

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,880
Mr. Gu,

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I've changed.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
Is this OK?

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,500
(Gu Yixiao)

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
No.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,480
Not alluring enough.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,840
How about this?

20
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,440
That's better.

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,880
Your taste is as simple and blunt

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
as always.

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Put your hand down.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
Put it down.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,120
You know very well

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,560
what those old men like.

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,240
They like sweet, flattering words.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
And your mouth

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,560
is your greatest weapon.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
If they try to get close to you,

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,320
let them think they've got a shot.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,480
So we can turn them to our advantage.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
You've been doing this for years.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,140
I shouldn't have to teach you now.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
Gu Yixiao,

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,560
all these years I've been winning
over the powerful for you,

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,920
drinking every night
until my stomach bleeds.

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,520
You've controlled me
for five whole years.

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,120
What will it take for you
to finally let me go?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ye Xingwan,

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,800
you'd better face the truth.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
Remember that what you owe me

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,520
can never be repaid in this lifetime.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,480
Don't think you can slip
out of my grasp.

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Go on, open it.

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Mr. Gu,

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
is this for me?

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Don't overthink it.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,720
It's for Xingyue.

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,520
Xingyue?

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,240
Such a pure color

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,520
doesn't suit you.

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,880
Then what suits me?

54
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,640
You suit

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,960
something more vibrant.

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,880
When this job's done, let me go.

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,280
And stay away from my sister.

58
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,160
Ye Xingwan,

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
I will give you all the benefits

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
you deserve.

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,560
Nothing else to discuss.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
(Gu Yixiao,)

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,160
(you did anything to get
what you want from me.)

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
(You forced me to stay close
to those old men.)

65
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
(Everyone laughed at me)

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,260
(for being your dog.)

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
(You crushed my pride.)

68
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,240
(Gu Yixiao,)

69
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,800
(you skillfully disguise yourself,
with morals and virtue,)

70
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,640
(appearing aloof and untouchable.)

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,200
(Only I know)

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
(that beneath your grand
and dignified exterior)

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,400
(lies nothing)

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,320
(more than a mad, deranged,)

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,160
(dark, and twisted lunatic.)

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
(You tear apart
your own facade in rage,)

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,840
(ans scheme against everyone
around you with cruelty.)

78
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
(Just wait and see.)

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
(I must take Xingyue)

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,800
(and escape from you, you devil.)

81
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,900
(Mr. Lu)

82
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Mr. Lu,

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,640
what are you doing?

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,520
You think I don't know?

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
Gu Yixiao sent you to set me up.

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Many group directors have fallen
into the trap.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Mr. Lu,

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,720
actually, we're on the same side.

89
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,600
If

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,840
we could join forces...

91
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
Join forces?

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,160
How?

93
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
Who do you think you are?

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,680
Once you leave him,

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,240
you're nothing.

96
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
Stop pretending to be innocent.

97
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,780
(Ye Xingyue)

98
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Yixiao.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
Is this for me?

100
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,160
It's...

101
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
Is this for me?

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,680
I know you treat me the best.

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
It's an early gift

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,550
to congratulate you
on your successful performance.

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,760
What's going on?

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
Mr. Gu,

107
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,440
Miss Ye, she...

108
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,440
We can't reach her.

109
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
What did you say?

110
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,920
The car sent to pick her up

111
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,960
never saw her show up.

112
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,600
I told you,

113
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,560
her every move must be monitored.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,660
If she can't be found
within half an hour,

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,320
you'll face the consequences yourself.

116
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
Is that my sister?

117
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Xingyue,

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,360
something came up suddenly,

119
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,560
so I can't be with you today.

120
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,100
Let me know when you're home.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Alright.

122
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,640
Mr. Gu, we've located Miss Ye.

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,040
We've brought her to Haicheng Villa.

124
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,720
(Ye Xingwan,)

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,560
(I'm not done settling our score yet.)

126
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
(You won't get away.)

127
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
What do you want from me?

128
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,680
Come here.

129
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,920
Next time, cut somewhere else.

130
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,200
It looks kind of gross.

131
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Ye Xingwan,

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
after all these years,

133
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,000
you still never learned to back down.

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,160
If you

135
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,880
try begging me now,

136
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,560
maybe,

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
I could treat you a little better.

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
Gu Yixiao,

139
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,240
if it hadn't been for Xingyue
all these years,

140
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,960
I wouldn't have put up with you.

141
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,560
But it seems your sweet sister

142
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
doesn't really appreciate it.

143
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
Gu Yixiao,

144
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,830
don't think just because
Xingyue likes you,

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,360
you can drive a wedge between us.

146
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
She's simply blinded

147
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
by your false kindness.

148
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,360
I know.

149
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,400
After all, how could you understand

150
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,640
that family bonds are

151
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,440
the strongest ties in this world?

152
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
You've never had a real family.

153
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,640
And no one's ever truly loved you.

154
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,280
Ye Xingwan, you'd better not push me.

155
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,990
Stop using those words to provoke me.

156
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,120
I will make sure you taste

157
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
the bitterness of betrayal by family.

158
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,320
I'll let you see

159
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,400
what it means to live
wishing you hadn't.

160
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
Mr. Gu.

161
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,280
(Wang Yaqin)
Mr. Chu asked me to clean up.

162
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,880
Wipe that look off your face.

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,360
Serve Xu Dashan well.

164
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,120
If this deal falls through,

165
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
you know

166
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
what will happen.

167
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,800
Pick it up with your hands.

168
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,120
He's already gone.

169
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
You don't have to do this.

170
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Watch your hands.

171
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,760
He must really dislike you.

172
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,400
What do you mean?

173
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,720
Gu Yixiao doesn't like that look
in your eyes.

174
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,440
You seem to know Gu Yixiao well.

175
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,680
Who are you?

176
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,920
I can teach you

177
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,960
how to deal with Gu Yixiao.
