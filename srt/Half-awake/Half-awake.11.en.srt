=Episode 11=

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,540
(Police Report)

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,800
Based on a tip-off,

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,800
the police caught three suspects

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,000
linked to the Dock Murder Case
six months ago.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,240
When they were taken in,

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,880
all had been beaten to varying degrees,

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,560
sustaining serious injuries.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,960
The prime suspect is still on the run.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
(14 years ago,)

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,760
(Gu Yixiao was 13 years old.)

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,600
(Could it have been him?)

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,000
(No word on the prime suspect
ever since.)

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,610
(With Gu Yixiao's temperament,)

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,360
(he wouldn't even spare me.)

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,120
(All these years,)

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,950
(how could he not look for that person?)

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,440
(Something must have happened.)

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,760
(His dad took out a high-interest loan.)

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,670
(But why did those people
play him like that?)

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,480
Play him...

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,470
When we're done playing him,
just finish him.

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,190
Then toss him into the sea.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
(Exactly.)

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,280
(There was never a deal.)

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,840
(If I didn't call the police,)

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,040
(he would die along with his dad.)

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,480
(Gu Yixiao,)

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
(I didn't cause your dad's death.)

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
(I even saved you.)

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
(I owe you nothing.)

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,780
(Xiao Yinan)

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,640
Xingwan,

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,300
ever since last time,

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,480
you haven't reached out to me.

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,920
- I was worried...
- Yinan.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,130
I followed your instructions

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,280
and checked the surveillance.

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,200
Take a look.

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,740
(Device offline)

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,610
Is there a problem?

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,640
This camera wasn't even turned on.

44
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,080
Not on?

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,200
(He turned off the cameras.)

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
(Why?)

47
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,300
Xingwan,

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,850
we can use this chance

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,260
to check the files on his computer.

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,540
Are you still worried about something?

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,740
All I heard from my sister was

52
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,900
that Mr. Ye owes him money.

53
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,060
Could there be more to it?

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,900
Yinan,

55
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,940
you head back first.

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,900
I'll take care of it.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,580
- But...
- Listen to me.

58
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,180
If I need your help,

59
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,420
I'll let you know.

60
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,100
(Gu Yixiao)

(Ye Qishan)

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,140
Dad?

65

(Copying two projects
to 'Project staff')

66
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,700
(It will take five hours.)

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,980
(Such huge files.)

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,380
(What's inside?)

69
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,300
(Project staff)

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,100
Hurry.

71
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,340
Back so early?

72
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,140
Just took a shower?

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,180
I got a bit hot, so I take a shower.

74
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,300
You went into my study again.

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,420
Last night,

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,340
I couldn't sleep.

77
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,980
Thought I'd find a book to read.

78
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,820
Oh really?

79
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,180
And did you find one

80
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,580
you wanted to read?

81
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,500
I found a book

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,860
named Economic Law.

83
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,580
I'll go change my clothes first.

84
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
Ye Xingwan,

85
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,380
if you really read my books,

86
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,300
you should know

87
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,020
all those books of mine

88
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,020
are just for decoration.

89
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,140
Go on.

90
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,060
What did you do in my study?

91
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,020
You turned off the cameras

92
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,940
to test me, didn't you?

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,940
You still haven't answered my question.

94
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,340
I just wanted to know you better.

95
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,860
You're lying to me again.

96
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,420
The noodles you made that day,

97
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,980
Wang Yaqin taught you, right?

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,980
You used her to get to me.

99
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,380
I asked her to teach me
how to please you.

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,260
I just want you to treat me
a little better.

101
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,340
Wang Yaqin taught me that.

102
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,820
But I really did want
to make you noodles.

103
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,180
Hello?

104
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,140
Hello?

105
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,540
This is Chengdong Police Station.

106
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,780
May I speak to Ye Xingwan?

107
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,620
Speaking.

108
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,980
Is your father Ye Qishan?

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
Have you reported his disappearance?

110
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,220
I have.

111
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,420
You found him?

112
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,100
A few days ago,
during bridge repairs in Binjiang,

113
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,820
a worker under the bridge

114
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,700
found a badly decomposed male body.

115
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,620
You left a DNA sample
when you filed the report.

116
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,700
We ran a DNA comparison.

117
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,340
The match result

118
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,980
is 99.99%.

119
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,620
If you're free right now,

120
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,980
please come and confirm it.

121
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,260
Yixiao.

122
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,780
Xingyue.

123
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,260
Sis.

124
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,780
They told me

125
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,620
that our dad...

126
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,580
Sis, I'm scared.

127
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,940
It's OK.

128
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,420
I'm here with you.

129
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,780
I'm going to confirm.

130
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,860
Ye Xingwan, right?

131
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,100
This is the DNA Test Report.

132
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
(Identification Document)
Please check it.

133
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,540
If everything is fine,

134
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,860
we'll inform the Police Station.

135
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,140
Where's the body?

136
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,820
What?

137
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,780
I said, where's the body?

138
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
You need to go to the Police Station.

139
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,500
We only have the report here.

140
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,420
You have nothing.

141
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,580
You just tell me he's dead.

142
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,940
Do you even know who Ye Qishan is?

143
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,580
He's the most self-centered person,

144
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,820
absolutely no boundaries.

145
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,900
He's like a cockroach.

146
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,180
He never dies.

147
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,460
He's probably living it up
somewhere now.

148
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,940
You're lying to me.

149
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,780
You're still lying to me.

150
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,220
Calm down.

151
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,180
We're only responsible
for the conclusion.

152
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,460
My dad weighs 140 pounds.

153
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Short hair.

154
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,260
A scar on his face.

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,940
(Identification Document)
What's this?

156
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,460
What is this?

157
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,590
You hand me just a few sheets of paper

158
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,460
and tell me he's dead.

159
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
Ye Xingwan,

160
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
calm yourself.

161
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,700
Gu Yixiao,

162
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,860
Ye Qishan's not dead, right?

163
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,460
He still owes you money.

164
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,300
How could he possibly be dead?

165
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,500
So he's still alive, isn't he?

166
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,740
Xingwan,

167
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,900
he's dead.

168
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,660
Dead?

169
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,380
Yeah.

170
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,150
Your dad, Ye Qishan,

171
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,540
has already passed away.

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,740
You need to face the truth.

173
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,420
Gu Yixiao,

174
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,620
let her go.

175
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,980
Hasn't the damage you caused her

176
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,780
been enough already?

177
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,780
What's between us

178
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,380
is none of your business.

179
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,420
Enough! Both of you, stop.

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,260
If you really care about her,

181
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,900
just take good care of Xingyue.

182
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,940
