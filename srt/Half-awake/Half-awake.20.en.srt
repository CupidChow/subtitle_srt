1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
You can go now.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,560
I'll make sure

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
you get what you deserve.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
Alright.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,760
I'll show you

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,080
who's really wrong.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,140
=Half-awake=

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,780
=Episode 20=

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
Why is it you?

10
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
You've been asking people

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
to pass messages to your son
many times.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
He never came,

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
so I came here

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,760
to do my share of duty for him.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
Don't make it sound so noble.

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,320
When Ye Xingwan shows up,

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,560
you seem pleased to see her.

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
But when it's me,

19
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,880
you turn cold.

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,920
Are you planning

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,280
to betray your own son again?

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
How do you even know that?

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,440
Want me to tell him myself?

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
You...

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
You can tell him if you want.

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,160
I don't really care.

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,200
But you'd better explain it to him

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
why

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,840
you took out Ye Xingwan's dad

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
and what's the secret

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,000
you can't let him know.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
It's you who wants the answer, isn't it?

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
But that's not important.

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
Whatever the secret is,

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
all these years,

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,320
I've treated him
like my closest brother.

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,000
But you all,

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,080
you all wanted him dead.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
So,

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll take you out for him,

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,360
of course, including you.

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,880
You...

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
You...

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
Xiao Qianyu.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
What a coincidence.

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,940
What are you trying to do?

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
Xingwan,

48
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
I have fulfilled

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
all your requirements.

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,330
Even the Mingfu Foundation account
you wanted,

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
I've already given it to you.

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
So does that mean

53
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,560
you'll be with me?

54
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,320
Or are you saying

55
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,860
you want to go back on your word?

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
Gu Yixiao,

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,960
what I said back then was,

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
if you could make it happen,

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
I would forgive you.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,680
And now, I forgive you.

61
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
You're fooling me.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,200
You're the one

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
who said you could do anything.

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,000
Losing patience already?

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,360
You stole files from my computer,

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,160
had someone hack
into my company's system

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
and investigated me.

68
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,780
You got involved
with the Mingfu Foundation's account.

69
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,920
You even tried to put me behind bars.

70
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I know all of it.

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,920
But none of that really matters now.

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
It's not important.

73
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,440
Whatever you want,

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
I'll give it to you.

75
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,640
Whatever you ask me to do,

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,080
I'll do it.

77
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,920
But you shouldn't treat me like this.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,080
Xingwan,

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
as long as you stay with me,

80
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
I can let go of everything else.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,560
What if I say no?

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Your dear brother, Xiao Yinan

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,880
did some questionable things
at the foundation.

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,160
I recorded it all.

85
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,050
Do you want to see it?

86
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,450
Gu Yixiao, what are you implying?

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,960
If I hand all this over

88
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
directly to the police,

89
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
then for him,

90
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,280
it's pretty much game over, right?

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,480
What's the point of doing this?

92
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Ye Xingwan,

93
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,160
if it's for you,

94
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,920
there's nothing I won't do.

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,640
If it's for you,

96
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,840
I could give up everything I have.

97
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,180
(Ye Xingyue)

98
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Xingyue.

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,040
Yixiao,

100
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,960
you finally picked up the phone.

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,040
What's wrong?

102
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,000
I just went to the hospital
to deliver something for Senior Ivan

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
and ran into Chu Muzhi.

104
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,170
He's been looking everywhere for you.

105
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
The cleaner in the VIP ward

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,680
of your company

107
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,800
passed away.

108
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
Oh, right.

109
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,240
Before she died,

110
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
she left you a letter.

111
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,040
A letter...

112
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
She asked me to pass it on to you.

113
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,280
But I've graduated

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,440
and I'm going to do an internship
abroad.

115
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,980
I'm heading to the airport right now.

116
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,260
I don't have time to give it to you.

117
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
I put the letter

118
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,320
in a certain place.

119
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
You go to find it yourself.

120
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Gu Yixiao,

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,440
you need to face the consequences
for what you did.

122
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,060
(Ye Xingyue)

123
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,560
You did it on purpose.

124
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course I did.

125
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,280
Bad deeds always deserve punishment.

126

regular clients)

129
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,880
(and those unknown contacts
in his phone,)

130
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
(the rest)

131
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,560
(are definitely suspicious.)

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,480
Miss Ye.

133
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Hey, Li.

134
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
What's up?

135
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,490
You're here to see Mr. Gu, right?

136
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,100
Actually, I came to see you.

137
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,580
(To Ye Xingwan from Gu Group)

138
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,740
This is your package.

139
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,060
It's been here for several days.

140
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,400
I've been keeping it safe for you.

141
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
I saw you come in just now,

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,240
so I brought this over for you.

143
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Thanks.

144
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,070
If there's nothing else,

145
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll head out first.
