2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,700
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,440
Where have you been all these years?

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,940
Why did you give up going to college?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,480
How could I even face you?

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
My dad ran off after borrowing money,

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,920
causing your family to lose everything.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,280
Qianyu,

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,880
you're the one
I can never face in this world.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,440
Are you serious?

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,720
Your dad who owed the money,

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
not you.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,360
Do you know

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,320
that I've been looking for you
all these years?

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,920
Does it even make a difference?

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,120
My dad's debt

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,280
still has to be paid by someone.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,880
When did you start smoking?

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,840
What exactly have you been doing?

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,800
Just look at yourself now.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
Qianyu,

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,770
the boss wants to meet you right away.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
Alright, got it.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,800
I'll call you in a bit.

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,640
OK.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,880
Xiao Qianyu was born in the same year,
month, and time as you, right?

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,960
What do you mean by that?

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,760
It's all her bad luck,

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
being born on the same day as you.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
Where's Xu Dashan?

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,080
Mr. Gu told us not to say anything.

32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,140
(Gu Yixiao)

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,260
Gu Yixiao,

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,620
what exactly are you trying to do?

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,550
Aren't you supposed
to stick to your principles?

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
Then let your best friend go.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,400
I remember you telling me once

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,320
you two share everything.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Even

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
you'd give up your life for each other.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,720
You let me know it on purpose.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,600
I just want to see

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,680
how deep things run between you two

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,800
and how much it would hurt you.

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,720
Gu Yixiao,

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm begging you.

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
Please, don't hurt Qianyu.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,880
I'll do whatever you ask.

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,160
Too late, Ye Xingwan.

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,360
I already told you

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,200
there's always a price for disobedience.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Gu Yixiao! Gu Yixiao!

53
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm secretary to Gu Yixiao.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,990
I can still make your life difficult

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,800
in the future.

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Hurry up and tell me

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,200
where Xu Dashan went.

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Say it! Where did Xu Dashan go?

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,920
Room 1305.

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Miss Ye.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Miss Ye, you know Mr. Gu well.

62
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,240
- Step aside.
- Miss Ye.

63
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,120
You should just leave.

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,040
I'll take the blame.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,880
Xingwan, what are you doing here?

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,120
Go now, Xingwan!

67
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Mr. Xu,

68
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
don't you want me?

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,440
Let me do it.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,840
Xingwan.

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,040
How could you...

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
Did they threaten you or something?

74
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,600
Xiao Qianyu,

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,400
don't be so full of yourself.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,400
Right now, I only care
about money and power.

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm willing to risk everything for it.

78
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,440
You'd better not get in my way.

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
No.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
In the past, you...

81
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,220
You said that was in the past.

82
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,360
People change over time.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
And, Xiao Qianyu,

84
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
if you want to be friends with me,

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
take a good look at yourself now.

86
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,760
Get her out of here.

87
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,360
Xingwan.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Xingwan!

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
(Qianyu,)

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
(I can't let you get hurt again.)

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,000
(Gu Yixiao,)

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
(I'm betting myself on you.)

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,660
(Gu Yixiao)

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,480
Gu Yixiao,

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
are you happy now?

96
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Where are you going?

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,080
We've been fishing Xu Dashan
for six months.

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
Are you giving it up because of a woman?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,930
Is she really worth it?

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,840
Miss Ye,

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,970
you sober up.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,840
Cut the talk.

103
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's start.

104
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,240
Who is it?

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,200
Yixiao,

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280
stop it.

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
He could die if you keep going.

108
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
The master made
quite an accurate prediction.

109
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,630
A bloodshed misfortune

110
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,920
happened so fast.

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,800
Guess you don't need any ritual now.

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,780
Put your clothes on and come out.

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
(You lost.)

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
Gu Yixiao.

115
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,040
You still care about me, don't you?

116
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,740
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have come to save me.

117
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,680
Don't flatter yourself.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,440
I just can't stand anyone who defies me.

119
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,120
You let Qianyu take my place.

120
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
Was that just to make me suffer

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
and let me beg you?

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,360
What a pity.

123
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,440
Seems I've disappointed you.

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
Ye Xingwan,

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,860
don't think I don't know
what you are thinking.

126
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
You used Xu Dashan to test my limits.

127
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,700
Let me tell you something.

128
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,640
Even if Xu Dashan succeeds today,

129
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,080
I won't have a shred of pity for you.

130
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,920
Even if I had to hand you over
to Xu Dashan myself,

131
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,760
I could still do it.

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,000
Next time,

133
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,420
if you act without my permission,

134
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,640
and move on your own,

135
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,600
you won't be that lucky again.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
Gu Yixiao.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Tell me why.

138
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
Why do you hate me so much?

139
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,280
(You really don't remember anything?)

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,080
I remember the moment I first saw you,

141
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,400
my dad ran away,

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
my mom passed away,

143
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
and I dropped out of school.

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,400
What did I do

145
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,740
that makes you despise me so much?

146
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,600
Ye Xingwan,

147
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
everyone has to pay the price

148
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
for what they've done.

149
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
(Yeah.)

150
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,880
(Everyone should face the cost
of their own actions.)

151
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,120
(Gu Yixiao,)

152
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,550
(I'm going to get close
to your inner circle,)

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,360
(gather solid proof of your crimes,)

154
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
(and bring you to justice.)

155
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Xingwan, Xingwan.

156
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
Are you OK?

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Did Xu Dashan do anything to you?

158
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm sorry, Qianyu, I'm so sorry.

159
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,480
It's fine.

160
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
Just now, I…

161
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
I saw you walking out with Mr. Gu.

162
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,680
Was it him who saved you?

163
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
Yeah.

164
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,360
Gu Yixiao saved me.

165
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,840
He helped me out.

166
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,200
It was all over.

167
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,480
Qianyu,

168
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
you've got it wrong.

169
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
Everything

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
has only just begun.

171
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,880
Do you resent her for not listening

172
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,080
or hate yourself for losing control?

173
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm exhausted.

174
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,420
(Chengdong Police Station)

175
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Gu Yixiao.

176
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
It's fine now.

177
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,960
Go pick up your bag and the flour later.

178
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
Fl... flour?

179
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,210
Come on, let's collect your stuff.

180
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,320
Sir, please help my dad.

181
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,800
He's the only family I have left.

182
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
- He's...
- Wu.

183
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,760
- Captain.
- We just got a report.

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
At Pier 5, near the containers,

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,040
they found a man's body.

186
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,200
Seems like he just died not long ago.

187
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,760
Got it.

188
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,880
What did you just say
