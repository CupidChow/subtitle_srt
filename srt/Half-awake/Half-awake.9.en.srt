=Episode 9=

3
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,360
Yixiao.

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,280
Xingyue.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,000
What brings you here?

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,880
Yixiao, it's your birthday.

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,080
Why didn't you tell me?

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,540
If Chu hadn't told me,

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,700
I wouldn't have known at all.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,200
I didn't want you worn out,

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,120
so I didn't tell you.

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,840
Have some apple juice.

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,120
Yixiao,

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,160
here's my birthday gift for you.

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Do you like it?

16
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,380
(Happy Birthday.
From Ye Xingwan)

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
This one

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,440
is from my sister?

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,800
That's not important.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,760
I really love the gift you gave me.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,720
Thanks.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,320
Xingyue.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,160
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,560
It's Yixiao's birthday today.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,720
I come to be with him.

26
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,760
Come home with me.

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,970
This isn't where you should be.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,720
Why can you come

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
but I can't?

30
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,260
You've stopped me from seeing Yixiao
since I was a kid.

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,000
Why?

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
Do you like him too?

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,880
You already have Senior Ivan.

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,780
Why take him from me?

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,360
Xingyue, stop talking nonsense.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,720
Muzhi,

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
take Xingyue home first.

38
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,320
Yixiao.

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Be good.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
What?

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,800
You are caught out by Xingyue.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,760
Afraid I'm targeting Xiao Yinan?

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,440
You care a lot about that young rookie.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,320
Xingyue is just a kid.

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,890
You actually believe what she says.

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,840
A kid?

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,720
Only in your eyes,

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,080
she's a kid.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,600
You've forgotten.

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,760
She's already 18.

51
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,520
If I remember right,

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,920
when you signed that contract with me,

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,600
you had just turned 18 too.

54
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,120
Xingyue has always looked up to you.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,480
You wouldn't want her to find out

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
what kind of shady things you've done.

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Of course.

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
Xingyue's a good girl.

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,270
I'd never let her deal with that stuff.

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
On the contrary,

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm going to pursue her.

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,040
Gu Yixiao,

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
don't use Xingyue to threaten me.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,120
There's nothing between me
and Xiao Yinan.

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,450
But the clients

66
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,240
you asked me to win over earlier,

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
they all really like me.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,600
If you even think about Xingyue again,

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
I won't hesitate to go to them.

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
After all,

71
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,760
they still can't get me
out of their heads.

72
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,740
Ye Xingwan,

73
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,590
if you act on your own

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,550
without my permission...

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,080
You must not let me go.

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,880
I've heard that too many times.

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,440
If you've got the guts, take me down.

78
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,380
(Ye Xingyue)

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Xingwan.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
Yinan.

81
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,760
I thought you wouldn't want
to talk to me anymore.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,040
Is it because of what happened
last time?

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,040
I'm sure it wasn't you.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,280
You believe me?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
When I first heard about it,

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,440
I admit, I acted on impulse.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,760
And your previous actions
were abnormal.

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,640
So I decided to drop by your office

89
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,200
to see what you were really up to.

90
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,710
Later, I calmed down.

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Ye Xingwan,

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,140
you've stood up for others
since you were a kid.

93
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,200
Every time someone picked on me,

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,660
it was always you who had my back.

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
How could a girl like that

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,720
ever want to hurt someone?

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
Especially when that person is me.

98
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,480
That day,

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,200
who was that person in your office?

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Did he pressure you into it?

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
Yinan,

102
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,090
don't ask about this anymore.

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,920
Since you've already left the club,

104
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
stay out of this mess from now on.

105
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,640
I'll reach out to some friends

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,840
to look for a professional
E-sports club,

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
and recommend you to them.

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,880
Do you not trust me?

109
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
Or do you think I can't keep you safe?

110
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,290
- I...
- It used to be you protecting me.

111
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,320
But now I've grown up.

112
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,920
It's my turn to protect you.

113
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,060
It's OK if you don't want
to talk about it.

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,160
I'll protect you

115
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,200
in my own way.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
There might be something

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
that only you can help me with.

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,320
But I have two conditions.

119
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,220
You need to promise me first.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
First,

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
if something unexpected happens,

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
don't act on your own.

123
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,920
Don't lose your cool.

124
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,480
Second,

125
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,120
don't tell your sister about this.

126
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
And keep it from Xingyue too.

127
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
Alright.

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Deal.

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,480
You got everything I just said, right?

130
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,600
Find out the model of the camera,

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
download the software,

132
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,600
connect to the camera,

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
then hand the phone to you.

134
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,560
That's right.

135
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,400
I'll try to install a Trojan on it.

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,360
If that works,

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,880
we can replace the footage.

138
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,600
Got it.

139
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,800
You're back.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
Why are you back?

141
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
This is my home.

142
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm just coming back to my own place.

143
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,040
Is that so strange?

144
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,000
But you

145
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,400
bring a guy home
in the middle of the night.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,120
What do you want to do?

147
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,000
You leave now.

148
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,360
Xingwan, I can't leave.

149
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,220
I'm worried he...

150
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,250
Since you're already here,

151
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,440
just don't go.

152
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Stay here

153
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,420
and have a drink together.

154
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,120
Do as I say.

155
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
Go back right now.

156
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,960
Xingwan,

157
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll wait out here.

158
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,460
If anything happens, just call me.

159
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,780
I'll call the police immediately.

160
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,800
You're scared?

161
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Then how could you dare
to be with another man

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,640
without my permission,

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
and bring him back to my house?

164
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,040
It's not what you think.

165
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
He was picking up Qianyu.

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
It was getting late,

167
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
so she asked him to drop me off.

168
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,680
You ruined my party

169
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,160
and then just walked away.

170
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
You were with that guy?

171
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,280
I didn't.

172
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Ye Xingwan,

173
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,340
have I been spoiling you
too much lately,

174
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
so that you forgot what you promised?

175
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,960
You said you want to be my woman.

176
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,160
So should I

177
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,680
fulfill you?

178
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Gu Yixiao.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,080
Gu Yixiao.

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Gu Yixiao.

181
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Gu Yixiao.

182
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
Gu Yixiao,

183
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,440
you've drunk too much.

184
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,120
You keep saying

185
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
that you want to be my woman.

186
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Right here.

187
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,160
Did you forget?

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,560
Fine.

189
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,200
I get it now.

190
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
It's because of him.

191
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
It has nothing to do with him.

192
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,280
I only see him as a younger brother.

193
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,920
You get all nervous once I mention him.

194
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,680
You still say you didn't betray me.

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,660
Say it.

196
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,040
Did you?

197
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,840
Why?

198
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
Why do you have to treat me like this?

199
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,960
Over the years, I've asked you
countless times.

200
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,880
But you just never gave me an answer.

201
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
It's been five years.

202
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,000
I feel like I've been living
in the gutter,

203
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,320
never catching a glimpse of daylight.

204
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,400
Now that I finally have them.

205
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,660
It makes me feel there are still people

206
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,280
in this world who love me

207
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,600
and who want to give me a hand.

208
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,640
But you insist on cutting those ropes,

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
dragging me into the swamp.

210
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
Why?

211
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,720
What exactly did I do wrong

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,640
to make you treat me like this?

213
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
It seems

214
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
you've never cried like this
in front of me before.

215
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,640
