=Episode 17=

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,520
Stop!

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,040
You're awake.

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,000
Xingyue.

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,480
I came to see you.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Aren't you happy?

8
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,520
Yixiao,

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,920
you've always been good to me.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
No matter how I clung to you,

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
you never lost patience.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,440
I never understood

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
why my sister resents you so much.

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,960
I really want to know

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,580
when you harmed my dad

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,220
because of your hatred
towards my sister,

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
did you ever think

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,320
that I'm also Ye Qishan's daughter?

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Gu Yixiao,

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,760
you used my feelings for you
to pressure my sister,

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,200
and keep dumping your misery
on everyone else.

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,000
You lost everything yourself,

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,480
and expect the whole world
to cry along with you.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,600
You're such a selfish wreck.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
If you're here

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,440
just to say that,

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
then you can leave.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,160
Excuse me.

29
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,410
The patient hasn't woken up yet.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,200
I've already checked in.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
I'll wait for him inside.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Then please,

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
pass this to him later.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,920
It's from the ward next door.

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,760
I think it's from his mother.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
Alright, thanks.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Still not leaving?

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
Ye Xingwan,

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
do you still think
you're some innocent girl?

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Your reputation

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
has been rotten for a long time.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
What a shame.

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,560
I don't like you at all.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
You really think I'd believe you?

45
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,140
Let me tell you something.

46
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,330
I want you by my side forever.

47
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,720
With me, through the endless abyss.

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,790
Whatever happened before,

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,880
whether you meant it or not,

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,980
whether it was a lie or not,

51
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,560
I'll make you walk through this with me.

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,840
I use you, step over you,

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,330
and make sure you can never
leave me.

54
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,600
Because you owe me.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,840
Right now, your son

56
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,320
is lying on the bed next door.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
What happened to him?

58
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,840
A suicide.

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
All because of a woman.

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
Ye Xingwan.

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
You figured it out.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,240
The moment I saw her,

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,480
I knew Gu Yixiao would fall for her.

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Even if it meant giving up everything.

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,600
Why are you so sure?

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,520
Because they're the same kind of people.

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
She understands him

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
and knows him well.

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Only she can redeem him

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,240
and help him escape from the abyss.

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
What can she really do?

72
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
Just charm a few people

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
and close a couple of deals.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
All these years,

75
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,280
I've been the one behind him,

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,360
helping him build everything he has.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
But years of brotherhood

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,440
still can't compete with one woman.

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,680
You,

80
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,280
hiding behind the name of brotherhood,

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,840
how many shady things
have you done behind his back?

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,040
You dragged him into the abyss.

83
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,840
You're just unnecessary.

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
No, he needs me.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
He really needs me.

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
He needs me to come up
with some strategies.

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,920
He needs me to handle the dirty work
for him.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,200
Can Ye Xingwan

89
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,200
really do that?

90
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
So what?

91
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
You've already done so much.

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
What goes around comes around.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,320
You can't escape it.

94
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,880
I found something.

95
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
I need to confirm it.

96
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,680
Xingwan,

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,050
I don't want to let you down again.

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,520
And I don't want you to get hurt.

99
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,160
I found something.

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
I need to confirm it.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,240
Xingwan,

102
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,060
I don't want to let you down again.

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,480
And I don't want you to get hurt.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
Please be careful.

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,020
(Teddy bear)
My sweet girl,

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
you're going to become

107
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
an incredible lawyer.

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,960
I've always been so proud of you.

109
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,640
This time, I want you

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
to be proud of me.

111
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,840
The doctor said if it's nothing serious,

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,130
you'll be discharged soon.

113
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,850
Just change the dressing regularly.

114
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,790
The bidding conference for that land
is the day after tomorrow.

115
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,760
Changda wants to compete with us.

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,150
I've already greased the wheels.

117
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
As for

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,480
Mr. Xu,

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,460
the police are keeping a close watch.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,840
That amount of money

121
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,960
probably needs a few days.

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,340
Leave that money untouched for now.

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,640
Acquiring this land

124
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,920
requires a large amount of funds.

125
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,280
If we do a direct deal,

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,470
there's a problem with that money.

127
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Just follow my plan.

128
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,600
That guy, Xiao Yinan,

129
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,520
works at the Mingfu Foundation now?

130
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah.

131
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,890
He has been interning there for a while.

132
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Ye Xingwan put you in this mess.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
You're not letting her go, right?

134
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,400
Help me draft a document.

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,960
Transfer half my shares

136
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
over

137
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
to Ye Xingwan.

138
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,100
Are you out of your mind?

139
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,990
You're giving her half of everything
you own.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Gu Group is a legacy
we built with our lives.

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,340
How could Ye Xingwan deserve
a piece of this?

142
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,440
Stop talking.

143
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,200
If you keep talking,

144
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,840
we won't even be brothers anymore.

145
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,660

(Engineering Project Bidding Contract)

147
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
How dare you run!

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
Keep running!

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Buddy,

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I gave you my word.

151
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,800
We're going to become

152
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,330
the strongest predators in this world.

153
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,990
No one will ever step on us again.

154
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,360
(Gu Group is something
we fought hard to regain.)

155
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,720
(No one can take it away.)

156
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,560
(No one.)

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,600
It's time to settle this.

158
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,280
You were right.

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,040
Half a year after his dad passed away,

160
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,720
Gu Yixiao was sent
to the juvenile prison.

161
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,500
(Criminal Verdict)
The charge was intentional injury.

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,680
Chu Muzhi went in two weeks after him.

163
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,640
So they met at the juvenile prison.

164
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,380
I have a feeling about this.

165
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
I think my dad found out some secret
between them.

166
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Why do you say that?

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,840
My dad loves to brag
and keep up appearances,

168
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,050
but he's not someone
who backs down easily.

169
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
He had no reason to run away.

170
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,120
Given what was happening then,

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,000
he could've just reported Gu Yixiao.

172
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
He was the victim.

173
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,040
It was tied to a personal account.

174
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,820
Looking into it would
make everything clear.

175
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
Could it be that your dad was afraid

176
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,600
Gu Yixiao would come
after your family?

177
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,960
No.

178
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
Even after he fled,

179
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
Gu Yixiao could still take it out on me.

180
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
Alright.

181
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,290
I'll find a way to dig deeper into it.

182
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,750
If there's any new development,

183
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll let you know right away.

184
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
