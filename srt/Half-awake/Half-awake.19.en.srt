1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
You gave that USB drive

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,680
to me on purpose,

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,400
right?

4
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,180
=Half-awake=

5
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,180
=Episode 19=

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
You hired someone

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,880
to kidnap me, didn't you?

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
Stop trying to frame me.

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
Your guy got beaten half to death by me

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,560
and confessed to everything.

11
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,200
All of this

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,480
was planned by you.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,480
Isn't that so?

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,800
Then go tell Gu Yixiao

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
and see if he believes you

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,840
or me.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,280
Chu Muzhi,

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
I wouldn't call it framing you.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600
Even if I hadn't done this,

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,720
you'd still make a move.

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,400
I just played along with your game

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,520
and completed your plan for you
in advance.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
I really underestimated you.

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,880
Never thought you'd be this ruthless,

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,600
even willing to use yourself.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,920
If not,

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,960
how can I survive

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,280
among people this shrewd?

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
That brotherhood you treasure

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,320
means nothing when love comes into play.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
You've worked for Gu Yixiao,

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
risking your life for over ten years.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,800
You handled all those dirty deals,

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,320
and shouldered the dangers for him.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
But you got nothing in return.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,080
And me,

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,560
someone he once hated most,

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
now he follows my every word.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,280
Doesn't that burn you up inside?

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,080
Do you really understand
our brotherhood?

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
Who do you think you are?

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Alright.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's see then

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,120
how strong your brotherhood really is.

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
I'll be watching closely.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,640
Why are you coming to see me again?

47
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,560
He was willing to risk his life for you.

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,840
And you still refuse to let him go?

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,720
You've been at Gu Group
for so many years.

50
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
You must've gathered

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
quite a bit from him.

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,440
Can you hand it over to me?

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Back then,

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,560
to get revenge on Yixiao's dad,

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,920
I didn't hesitate to use myself
to reach that goal.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
But you've seen it.

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
What did I really gain?

58
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,560
My only son

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,320
ends up despising me.

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
Do you

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,080
only have hatred towards Gu Yixiao?

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,800
I... I never thought about it.

63
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
So, it's not entirely absent.

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Right?

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Ye...

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Miss Ye,

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,440
you still have time to step back now.

68
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,860
Maybe

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,920
both you and Yixiao

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,030
could live a peaceful life.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,240
No matter what you say,

72
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
my answer will stay the same.

73
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,320
Gu Yixiao broke the law.

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
He deserves the consequences.

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,840
Are you really trying
to have him killed?

76
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Have you ever considered

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,760
that letting Gu Yixiao face justice

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
might be the best way to save him?

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
If you really want to help him,

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
then hand me what you're holding.

81
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,280
By the way,

82
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
I've got one last question for you.

83
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,720
Back then,

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,160
who was really behind hurting Gu Yixiao?

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
That's all of it.

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,920
This client list seems pretty important.

87
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,560
If they actually use these accounts

88
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,800
to do anything illegal,

89
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,040
this list becomes the clearest proof.

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
I pulled this out of the shredder.

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
The list should be in here.

92
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
It's impossible to piece back together.

93
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,120
Maybe I could check Mr. Wu's computer.

94
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,800
That's way too risky.

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,960
Don't act on impulse.

96
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,240
Let me think of another way.

97
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,120
What other way do you have?

98
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,560
Are you still going
to keep getting involved with him?

99
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,560
Let me help you.

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
Ye Xingwan,

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,480
I like you.

102
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,720
I can't just stand by
and watch the woman I like

103
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
being tormented by a monster.

104
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,360
I've dreamt of bringing him to justice,

105
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,440
so you could finally live a normal life.

106
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,320
Xiao Yinan,

107
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I don't like you.

108
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
We're not from the same world.

109
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,000
There's no way back for me.

110
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,960
Why did you let her join the project?

111
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,010
It's been so many years.

112
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,360
I've always listened to you.

113
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
But I can't just stand by and watch you

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
being sent to prison by that woman!

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
I simply can't stand by

116
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,360
and watch Gu Group,
our hard-earned efforts,

117
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,400
be destroyed completely

118
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,960
because of her.

119
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
So,

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
you had someone kidnap her.

121
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,920
You think I did it?

122
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,400
Do you really not trust me at all?

123
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
I know

124
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,280
everything you've done.

125
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,840
Chu Muzhi,

126
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,600
I don't want to fight you.

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
But Ye Xingwan is my bottom line.

128
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,640
You keep hurting her again and again,

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
and my patience

130
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
has its limits too.

131
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,960
I know

132
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,000
your mother betrayed you,

133
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400
so you trust no one.

134
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,040
But what about me?

135
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,280
We've fought side by side for 15 years.

136
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,560
Chu Muzhi,

137
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,000
through all this time,

138
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,240
I've always trusted you.

139
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,520
Whatever you wanted to do,
I never questioned it.

140
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,920
But this time,

141
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,120
you've crossed my line.

142
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
You can go now.

143
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
I'll make sure

144
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,720
you get what you deserve.

145
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,760
But I can't let you meddle
in my life anymore.

146
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,320
Alright.

147
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll show you

148
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,600
who's actually wrong.

149
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,430
- Dr. Chen.
- Hello.
