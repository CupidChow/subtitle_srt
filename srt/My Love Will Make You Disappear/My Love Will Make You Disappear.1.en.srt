00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,231
Oh? See?

183
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,108
Brand new!

184
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,152
A fresh catch!

185
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,404
So grab it before it spoils!

186
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,989
Nida, you do mean the jacket--

187
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,949
-I meant the jacket.
-The jacket.

188
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,242
-Love!
-Oh?

189
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,620
Say hi to our buyers first.

190
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,705
Give them a killer move.

191
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,458
-[shouts] Ah!
-Hey!

192
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,003
That's right! Silky smooth!

193
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,713
-Someone wants you. Move.
-Oh, okay.

194
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,465
My husband is not for sale.

195
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,508
[smooches]

196
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,259
Okay! Back to work.

197
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,844
[Jheng] Get lost!

198
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,262
Get out of here.

199
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,223
I'm the one with the big mouth?

200
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,558
That's enough. Thanks, Sari.

201
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,436
[Jheng] And don't ever come back here!

202
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,397
One more and I'll slap you.

203
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,857
Wait, let's talk about this.

204
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,777
Jheng, let Ritchie speak.

205
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,320
How? He's mute.

206
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,697
I knew that. Just listen to Jheng.

207
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,658
Come on, Sari. He's deaf, too.

208
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,785
But you love each other, right?

209
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,036
Then say sorry.

210
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,207

212
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,711
Get a room, you two!

213
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,714
Miss Sorry! Miss Sorry!

214
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,134
-Hi, Mik-mik!
-[smooches]

215
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,929
[Jesse] Sweetheart, what did we teach you?

216
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,890
-It's "Sari." Not "Sorry."
-Sorry!

217
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,853
Oh! Miss Sorry, look at all my awards!

218
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,605
Wow! You're amazing, Mik-mik!

219
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,482
Best in Cuteness!

220
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,817
[cute squealing]

221
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,778
Best in… Daughter?

222
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,864
Your teacher gave you these?

223
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,366
Oh, no. Dada and Papa did.

224
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,784
-Deserved!
-Deserved!

225
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,078
-Okay, time for bed.
-Bye, Dada!

226
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,122
-Bye Sari!
-Bye. Take care!

227
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,999
-Good night, Mik-mik!
-Good night, Miss Sorry!

228
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,625
[Rom] Good night, Sari!

229
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,503
Oh, thank you. Bye!

230
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,797
Hey! Hey! Where are you going? It's late!

231
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,425
-Sis, I just have a date with…
-[Carlo] Sis.

232
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,926
I'm just picking up Lyka.

233
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,637
Another date? Wow, you guys must be rich!

234
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,681
If something bad happens to you,

235
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,141
your mom will haunt me!

236
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,393
If that happens, I swear! Hey, Carlo.

237
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,228
Be home before ten.

238
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,188
-We're going, sis.
-Hey, did you do the laundry?

239
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,398
Tomorrow.

240
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,192
Tomorrow? I can't believe you.

241
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,652
Date--

242
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,573
-Cookie! Cookie!
-[squeaking]

243
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,993
Come on, let's eat.

244
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,912
[chuckles]

245
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,999
Gosh.

246
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,168
I don't know how to deal
with Lyka anymore.

247
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,252
She's so stubborn!

248
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,630
She doesn't answer my calls.

249
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,675
Good thing you cooked
my favorite sour shrimp soup!

250
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,052
[Remy] Let her be. She's in love.

251
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,554
You're acting like
you've never been in love.

252
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,431
Grandma…

253
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,059
You all know why I can't, right?

254
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,897
Dear, it's 2025.
You still believe in curses?

255
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,315
Grandma, it's real!

256
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't you want someone
to take care of you?

257
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,235
Someone to love you?

258
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,907
Not anymore.

259
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,493
I can live by myself.

260
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,995
Yes you can, but do you want to?

261
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,914
Now, let me ask you--

262
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,875
Do you want to grow old alone?

263
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,960
Grandma…

264
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,711
All that lovey-dovey thing…

265
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,129
Oh my!

266
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,006
it's just a waste of time.

267
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,468
Love is never a waste of time.

268
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,971
[pensive music playing]

269
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,806
Berto's been gone a long time.

270
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,644
But my love for him keeps me alive.

271
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,146
And so does my love for Bochog.

272
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,483
Bochog?
You keep talking about your grandson.

273
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,360
You always tell me stories about him.

274
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,946
Has he ever visited you?

275
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,906
Even if he's not here,

276
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,450
I love that boy dearly.

277
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,412
Oh, you two would get along.

278
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,413
[chuckles]

279
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,748
I'm sure you'd make a great pair.

280
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,418
Not until he visits you.

281
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,631
[Sari] Where is he anyway?

282
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,677
[doorbell dings]

283
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,594
What?

284
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,221
[hotel staff] Hello, sir!

285
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,974
Just letting you know that…

286
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,852
It's huge!

287
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,772
-What is?
-Your bill--it's gotten really huge.

288
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,941
-And the cards you gave us?
-[door thuds]

289
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,901
All declined.

290
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,445
Sorry to bother you.

291
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,280
You know what?

292
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,990
I'm really sorry.

293
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,868
I lost my wallet. I don't have it with me.

294
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,494
Obviously.

295
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,498
But I promise,
I'll be back tomorrow to settle my bill.

296
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,292
Alright, sir.

297
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,836
See you tomorrow!

298
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,172

-Bye!

Just stay there, okay?

311
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,927
Don't go outside.

312

They'll pressure Grandma
into selling Tahanan!

Where is Mrs. Mejares?

320
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,613
Have some compassion! She's old!

321
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,864
She's not here!

We just want to talk to her!

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,617
Get out of here!

-Leave!
-Leave!

325
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,204
Now, wait a hot minute.

326
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,747
Grandma, go back inside.

327
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,748
We can handle this. Right?

328
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,041
[indistinct chatter]

329
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,585
You're never
gonna leave me alone, are you?

330
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,962
If you don't leave right now,

331
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,338
I'll have you charged with trespassing!

We just want to help.

334
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,552
I already told you
I'm not selling this place!

335
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,095
And I'm not the only one
you have to go through.

336
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,555
Aren't you the owner?

337
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,514
I am!

338
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,307
But all my tenants here

339
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,143
have rights to Tahanan Homes.

340
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,227
-That's right!
-It belongs to them, too.

341

-It belongs to all of us!
-That's right.

342
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,816
And you won't take it from us
as long as I'm alive.

343
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,317
So get out of here!

344

We didn't even get to see her wake.

351
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,007
Only close family members were allowed.

352
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,927
But they never even visited her here.

353
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,096
We were closer to her than they were.

00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,776
She loved her husband so much,

359
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,945
she followed him to the grave.

-Hi.

00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,500
The reason I came here is
to tell you about Tahanan Homes,

363
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,919
since this concerns the tenants.

364
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,838
In the event that she passes away,

365
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:50,259
Tahanan Homes will be
given to her only grandson, Jolo Gonzales.

373
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,210

You can do this, Jolo.

382
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,477
It'll be quick.

Whatever it is you're planning,

390
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,549
don't do it!

391
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,636
If you fall, the fishes will feast on you.

392
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,679
There are crocs in there, too!

393
00:18:58,763 --> 00:18:59,680
Huh?

394
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,015
Wait, who are you?

395
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,308
Why do you care?

396
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,726
Mind your own business!

397
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,519
Mind my own business?

398
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,063

Let me see.

403
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,496
You know what? Next time,
just mind your own business.

404
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,081
So annoying.

406
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,504
He's the--

It's really him!

00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,949
She was still my mother-in-law.

412

A lawyer came to the house.

420
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,654
I told him I'd give this to you myself.

421
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,327
He said you can keep it
or you can sell it.

422
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,288
Either way, it's all yours.

423
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,082
I'll go ahead.

You haven't even seen his face!

428
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,233
[Nida] Oh, I'd date him,
love him, marry him,

429
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,611
and grow old with him!

Of course. It's Grandma's cooking.

I'll be your first passenger.

-Right?
-[Nida] You know, Sari.

I've got a lot going on.

543
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,789
Sari, didn't you just say…?

544
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,749
"Tahanan Homes is our home," right?

545
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,666
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

546
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,126
-Please talk to him.
-Why do I have to go alone?

547
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,712
-Can't anyone come with me?
-You can do it alone!

Good morning!

551
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,718
Freshly baked bread! As fresh as me!

552
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,470
A little sweetness to start your day!

553
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,763
It's best enjoyed while we talk about--

Oh my.

557
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,478
Special delivery for your sweet tooth

558
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,939
from a sweet girl like me!

559
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,398
You're welcome!

560
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,817
Don't mention it!

[door thuds]

562
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,821
So grumpy!

[frustrated grunt]

564
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,241
Bochog! How did you like
the bread we gave you?

565
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,617
-We all chipped in for that.

Psst!

575

Psst!

[playful music playing]

577
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,621
[Sari, in an elderly voice] Grandson…

578
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,665
Bochog!

579
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,708
Grandma?

580
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,793
[Sari, in an elderly voice] It's me, dear.

581
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:54,172
I have something to ask of you.

582
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,008
What is it, Grandma?

583
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,385
Anything for you.

584
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,471
[playful music continues]

585
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,932
I can't cross over to heaven.

586
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,852
You have to do this, my child.

587
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,772
Take care of… Tahanan.

588
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,233
Yes, Grandma.

589
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,987
Be good to the people living here.

590
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,781
I'll try, Grandma.

591
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,493
And for me to finally ascend to heaven,

592
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,414
talk to Sari.

593
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,875
S-Sari?

594
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,335
The cute one. [coughs]

595
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,211
The kind lady.

596
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,130
The beautiful girl.

597
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,299
The pretty one.

598
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,384
The little Chinese princess.

599
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,053
She's a good person.

600
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,514
Don't be rude to her.

601
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,892
She's very--

602
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,061
[haunting noises]

603
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,270

Grandchild!

607
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,906
Are you messing with me?

608
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,826
Uh-- Sorry. It's just that--

609
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,286
You think you're funny?

610
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,579
You're dragging the dead into this?

611
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,831
How dare you disrespect my grandma?

612
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,458
What do you want from me?

613
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,379
I'm really sorry.

614
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,800
We all heard that
you're selling Tahanan Homes.

615
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,511
It's none of your business
if I sell this place or not.

616
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,681
I don't even know how you
all put up with this dump.

617
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,933
This is our life.

618
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,060
We're happy as long as we're all together.

[snort]

620
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,146
Let me guess.

621
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,607
You've lived here since you were a kid.

622
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,985
You're content here.
This place matters to you.

623
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,862
You're happy here, right?

624
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,034
Your life must be so sad
if this is all that makes you happy.

625
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,870
Don't you have anyone to take you
out of this shithole?

[somber music playing]

627
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,249
Don't you have
a boyfriend to move in with?

628
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,792
Oh, wait--

629
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,586
You don't have
to answer that because obviously,

630
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,380
you don't have a boyfriend.

631
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,424
Who would even like you?

632
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,428
You're weird! You're annoying!
And you're crazy!

633
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,806
Don't drag me into your miserable life!

634
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,310
Get out!

[boss] Wow.

637

You're late and
you're taking an extended break.

638
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,213
Take your time, why don't you?

639
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,132
Take your sweet time.

640
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,392
[Jolo] Bro, I promise
this is the last time.

641
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,728
[Tristan] Bro, I can't lend you money.

642
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,230
I don't want Tala
and Boss Poyo on my case.

643
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,899
Sorry. I'm out.

Well, well, well…

I knew it.

654
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,737
We'll find that lowlife in this dumpster.

655
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,780
Find him.

you'll pay with your life.

The loan shark just passed by.

I still owe him money.

What? How much do you owe him?

It must have been excruciating!

They dunked his head,
hung him upside down,

709
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,102
then beat him up!

00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,937

[Lyka] Oh, so you want to disappear?

718
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,330
Then why don't you just make
my big sister Sari fall in love?

you're spilling her secret,

00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,925
Boss, don't mind her. She's just drunk.

724
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,343
It's all drunk talk.

725
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,428
Cursed?

726
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:01,224
Yes!
Every time she kisses a man she loves,

727
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,851
he disappears.

728
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,269
[scoffs]

729
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,312
Bullshit.

730
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,773
Didn't she kiss Papa P on TV before?

731
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,400
Then bam! He vanished.

732
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,279
[Lyka] And all the other men, too.

733
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,489
-Gone.
-[Jolo] What do you mean, gone?

734
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,327
As in, never seen again.

735
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,745
But they didn't die.

736
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,290
No blood, no disease, no bodies.

737
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,667
Just vanished into thin air.

738
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,711
And this stays between us, okay?

739
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:34,299
Sari doesn't fall in love anymore.

740
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:39,179
Maybe because she's afraid
of getting hurt again, right?

741
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:40,972
MADAM TALA - PAY UP OR I'LL KILL YOU!

742
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,224
BOSS POYO’S DONE BEING PATIENT! GO!
PAY UP OR I'LL KILL YOU! GO!

743
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,270
[Lyka] So if I were you,
and you wanna escape your problems…

744
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,649

[Jolo] Let me drive you.

761
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,790
Sari!

762
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,710
[Jesse] Good morning, Sir Jolo! What's up?

763
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,294
[Rom] Sir, are you okay?

764
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,630
[Mik-mik] Were you looking for Miss Sorry?

765
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,424
You like her, don't you?

766
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,426
[quirky music continues]

767
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,469
Ahh, Baby, there you go again.

768
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,054
You're so observant!

769
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,264
[Mik-mik] Thank you!

770
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,640
Jolo, sorry about that.

771
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,560
Our little girl has no filter.

772
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,730
But I'm just curious, do you like her?

773
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,691
Why does it matter to you if I do?

774
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,651
Um, no offense, Sir Jolo,

775
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,447
but If I were Sari,
I'd be a little scared.

776
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,492
You're not exactly giving Prince Charming.

777
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,203
Right now, it's giving Beast.

778
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,455
Right?

779
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,040
[music ends]

00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,589
[Sari] Hey, do you guys want a snack?

781
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,674
Wow! She's gonna treat us!

782
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,468
Okay, let's go. I'm game!

783
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,720
Wait, let me find my wallet.

784
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,096
Where did I put it?

785
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,390
Girls.

786
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,476
A handsome guy is looking this way.

787
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,936
You always say that for every guy.

788
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,438
But he really is good-looking!

789
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:57,692

[Jolo] Hi, Sari!

793
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,976
Come on, I'll drive you home.

794
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,687
What are you doing here?

795
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,356
Picking you up.

796
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,942
Picking me up? What's your deal?

797
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,653
Just the other day, you were saying
those horrible things to me.

798
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,446
Now you're acting all nice.

799
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,826
You even said
not to drag you into my misery.

800
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,119
-It's true, you're miserable.
-Hey! [shushes]

801
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,291
I'm sorry for what I said last time.

802
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,418
Friends?

803
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:02,423
Apology accepted, friendship denied.

Flowers for you.

815
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,709
And of course, Sari, flowers for you.

816
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,835
Take the flowers.

817

-[Ditas] Thank you.

Are you following me?

826
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,772
You're too assuming.
What if I'm just craving for kwek-kwek?

827
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,566
[Ditas] I guess! Get some!

Sari, are you a kwek-kwek?

829
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,073
Because you make my heart beat

It turns you into a bad person.

But even after everything
that happened to me,

974

I just hope,

976
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,310
I find a love that never disappears.

977
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,195
Is there really a love like that?

987
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,110
No. I'm good.

988
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,072
Because you're afraid of getting hurt?

989
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,825
Because I'm afraid of hurting someone.

990
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:59,830
I don't want to be the reason
someone wants to disappear.

01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,539
Boss--

1437
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:32,333
-Boss--
-Poyo?

1438
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,669
[Nida] You know him?

1439
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,089
So what he's saying is true?

1440
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,966
You used Tahanan to pay off your debt?

1441
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,843
-You sold it?
-No!

1442
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:46,764
You had this place renovated
just to sell it for a higher price!

1443
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,641
-Jheng, it's not like that.
-[Rom] Not like that?

1444
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,184
Where were you when
we were being attacked?

1445
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,646
You're usually here, but you disappeared
when they came to collect.

1446
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,897
How convenient!

1447
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,358
You used us.

1448
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,734
Unbelievable.

1449
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,236
Sari.

1450
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,280
[Nida] You're a user.
What would your Grandma say?

1451
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,158
[Jolo] Sari, please.

1452
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,368
Is it true?

1453
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,248
-Sari--
-Jolo, is it true?

1454
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,709
Did you really sell us out?

1455
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,380
[morose music playing]

1456
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:26,220
Yes.

1457
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,017
I considered selling Tahanan.

1458
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,812
Not because I wanted to.

1459
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,773
But because I had to.

1460
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:42,653
Before I moved here,
I was drowning in problems.

1461

[somber music playing]

1462
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,657
Yes.

1463
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,910
I know Boss Poyo.

1464
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,788
Yes, I owe them money.

1465
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,873
An impossible amount.

1466
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,377
And I had no idea
how I was going to pay it back.

1467
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,423
I was so desperate at that time!

1468
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:06,010
I thought if I sold Tahanan,

1469
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:09,388
I could pay off all my debts.
All of it would be solved.

1470
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,765
That it was going to be quick.

1471
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,476
Easy.

1472
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,813
Painless.

1473
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:23,235
And yes, I admit
that I was planning to sell it,

1474
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,821
but I wish you'd believe me now

1475
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,698
when I say I didn't do it.

1476
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,033
I didn't do it.

1477
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,784
And the reason I wasn't here earlier--

1478
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:34,163
The reason I was gone
was because I was trying to fix this.

1479
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,749
Please believe me.

1480

Sari, you believe me, don't you?

1487
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,912
Sari, I didn't go through
with selling Tahanan.

1488
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,582
Because you've all become important to me.

1489
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,251
Especially you, Sari.

1490
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,841
Why did you hide this from us?

1491
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:31,970
From me?

1492
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:36,850
Sari, it's because…

1493
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,936
…because I'm a coward.

1494
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,649
I was scared that
if you knew all of this--

1497
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,742
you'd stop loving me.

Sari, I was scared that…

1499
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:00,833
…that I'd lose you
like everyone I've lost before.

1500
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:05,879
Is that why…

1501
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,259
Is that why you chose to just disappear?

1503
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,720
Because that was easier.

1504

Quick.

1505
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:17,724
Easy.

That's what you said, right?

Jolo…

1509
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:31,864
Is it harder to trust my love?

Sari, just--

1511
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,415
Just give me this one chance, okay?

1512
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,709
I'll fix everything, just trust me.

You're here now.

1519
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,394
But I don't know if
you'll still be here tomorrow.

You're in trouble again.

You disappear without a word.

doesn't mean I want to.
