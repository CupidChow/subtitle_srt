[Fall in Love with a Fox]
[EP13]

3
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,490
Now, all sects

4
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,050
have changed their attitude to Tingqin Garden

5
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,009
since the wedding night in Taoyuan Valley.

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,530
Some people even said that

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,800
what you did is to provoke

8
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,770
Alliance of Martial Arts.

9
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,850
It was urgent that night.

10
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,970
As long as I can prevent

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
those people of Nonuple Palace from taking Baiwan away,

12
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,530
I wouldn't regret.

13
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,759
But...

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,080
What?

15
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,170
I have surveyed the

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,530
Young Host of Palace.

17
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,210
As you expected,

18
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,810
Qingyun

19
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
and Chu

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,199
grew up together.

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,890
Qingyun was blind since he was young.

22
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,290
It was Chu who has been taken care of him.

23
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,250
Therefore,

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,610
he is fond of Chu

25
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,970
deeply.

26
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,610
Five years ago,

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,570
Nonuple Palace declared that

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,890
Chu was disappeared.

29
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,160
Young Host was in pain.

30
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,200
It's a pity that

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,970
although Young Host of Palace was in deep love

32
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,250
and met Chu

33
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,200
five years later,

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,520
this time our Lord

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,930
seizes the initiative.

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,170
What do you mean?

37
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,450
I just think that

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,730
we took

39
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,329
Miss Jin to Tingqin Garden,

40
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,610
Qingyun

41
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,329
won't forgive us.

42
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,530
So what?

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,170
Whoever he is,

44
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,730
I won't

45
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,890
allow people of Nonuple Palace

46
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,050
to approach Baiwan.

47
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,840
Mrs.

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,050
Zheng, are you there?

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Just leave them to me.

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,920
I can take care of him.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,560
Okay.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,280
Baiwan is coming.

53
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,250
Zheng, are you there?

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,480
Zheng, what are you going to do?

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,400
Go away.

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,360
Zheng

57
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,360
I took some breakfast for you.

58
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,240
It's so early.

59
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,450
Come in.

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,520
Zheng

61
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,240
Does it hurt?

62
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,800
No.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,760
You haven't changed your clothes.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,290
I'll call the maid in.

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,010
No.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,890
She's a girl.

67
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,360
She can't change clothes for you.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,360
Then, I'll ask Jianshan.

69
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,200
No, he can't either.

70
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,920
Why?

71
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,050
I'm your wife.

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,080
I can help you.

73
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,170
Don't bother others.

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,290
If you need any help,

75
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,640
I can do it for you.

76
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,200
Then,

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,290
how can you help me?

78
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,330
Let me see...

79
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,330
Young Mrs.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,570
Head Escort Jin

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,360
left this morning.

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,330
He asked me to deliver the letter to you.

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,010
Left?

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,010
Qiuer, you finally got married.

85
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,200
So I come back to the Escort Agency.

86
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,170
I don't want to

87
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,330
see you cry.

88
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,610
So I didn't tell you.

89
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,850
From now on,

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,760
you and Linfeng

91
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,360
should support and love each other.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,450
Then, I'll feel relieved.

93
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,080
Baiwan left.

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,760
Dad left, too.

95
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,200
How can you leave me here

96
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,010
alone!

97
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,240
Young Mrs., by the way,

98
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,360
I just heard...

99
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,450
Stop.

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,050
I'm sad now.

101
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,080
You asked me to inquire about

102
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,200
Miss Jin Baiwan, didn't you?

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,480
Baiwan?

104
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,080
Just tell me.

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,240
I just heard Lord of Valley and Mrs.

106
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,200
were talking about

107
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,409
Miss Jin Baiwan.

108
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,730
They said

109
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,680
Qu Zheng of Tingqin Garden is a renegade.

110
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,170
What?

111
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,080
Lord Qu

112
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,730
told me

113
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,890
he was attacked in the valley

114
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,320
the night before the wedding.

115
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,320
I was afraid of affecting your marriage,

116
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,090
so we just

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,530
hid it.

118
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,090
I thought

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,920
Taoyuan Valley

120
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,210
was their objective.

121
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,970
But at the wedding night,

122
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,290
Lord Qu stunned everyone

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,800
to take Jin Baiwan away.

124
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
Then I just understood that

125
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,360
all the issues

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,610
are linked with

127
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,680
the Lord

128
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,970
of Tingqin Garden.

129
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,650
His behaviors

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,210
not only pissed off the crowd,

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
but also affected our Taoyuan Valley.

132
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,970
Now all sects

133
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,320
think that Tingqin Garden and Jin's Escort Agency

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,170
are related with

135
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,170
Puyuan Canon case.

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,410
Your father-in-law

137
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,409
is afraid of embroiling our Taoyuan Valley,

138
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,970
so he left in advance.

139
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,650
If Jin Baiwan

140
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,610
was taken by

141
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,530
those of Nonuple Palace at that day,

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,000
then everything is okay.

143
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,610
Lord Qu

144
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,610
looks calm.

145
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,970
How can he be so stupid

146
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,800
in dealing with this thing?

147
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,000
Jin Baiwan and Jin's Escort Agency

148
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,360
have a close connection.

149
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
Feng

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,560
Take care of Miss Jin these days.

151
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't allow her to

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,120
communicate with Jin Baiwan.

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,770
Otherwise, we may be in trouble.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,050
No problem.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
I will tell Qiuer.

156
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,440
They slander

157
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,770
Baiwan and Mr Qu.

158
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,090
I don't know the condition of Baiwan.

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,680
I have to figure out an idea.

160
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,210
That's it.

161
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm Qiu Qiuer.

162
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,210
As long as I write the story

163
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,650
of Baiwan into my novels,

164
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,850
then all people will know

165
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,680
Baiwan and Mr Qu are innocent.

166
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,970
Young Master of Valley

167
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,120
Lord of Valley asks us to...

168
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
Qiuer and Miss Baiwan

169
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
have a good relationship.

170
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,880
It's not easy to cut their connection.

171
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,560
The words I just said

172
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,770
were to relieve

173
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,730
my parents.

174
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,730
After all, she

175
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,770
went here alone.

176
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,210
She must be lonely and helpless.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,530
Jueming

178
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,290
You

179
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,410
send some

180
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,850
dishes she likes to her room tonight.

181
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,770
Okay.

182
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,880
I bought the food,

183
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,000
medicine,

184
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,290
and sugar.

185
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,440
Is there anything I need to buy

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
for Zheng?

187
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,650
That's it.

188
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,770
Zheng is boring

189
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
since he's sick.

190
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,049
I can buy him novels.

191
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,360
You even have

192
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,409
novels written by Qiu Qiuer?

193
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,800
We have

194
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,800
all Qiu Qiuer's novels.

195
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,120
There are only a few.

196
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,480
The others are in the store.

197
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,850
I can take them

198
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,850
for you to have a look.

199
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,730
Okay.

200
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,000
Wait a moment.

201
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,360
Spoony Royal Highness.

202
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,440
It was out of print.

203
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,770
How can you have it?

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,970
The No.1 Husband.

205
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,680
It's my favorite novel.

206
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,610
Miss

207
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,170
Is the novel in your hand

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
that interesting?

209
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,610
Yes.

210
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
You can have a look.

211
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,170
Then,

212
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,440
why is it interesting?

213
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,360
I admire the No.1 husband

214
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,680
shield his wife from the glare of the sun,

215
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,050
and they chat under the tree.

216
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,090
Zheng, it's you!

217
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I didn't recognize

218
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,440
that it was you

219
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,530
just now.

220
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,560
I didn't see you

221
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,920
since the morning.

222
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm worried about you.

223
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,650
So you are here to...

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,770
No.

225
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm afraid you're boring.

226
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,120
So I want to buy a novel for you.

227
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,970
But I don't know

228
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,210
which one you like.

229
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,610
I think

230
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,090
the one in your hand

231
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,000
is good.

232
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,000
This one?

233
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,680
No.

234
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,170
Why not?

235
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,170
Since you like it,

236
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,410
it must be a good novel.

237
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,050
I need to know

238
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,320
my wife's preference.

239
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,200
They use lotus leaves together to keep the rain off.

240
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,200
Do you like it?

241
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,490
Gently kissed her mouth with his mouth

242
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,530
and swallowed the cake.

243
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,440
It's interesting.

244
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,370
I learned a lot

245
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
from The No.1 Husband.

246
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,010
Is this your favorite

247
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,170
plot in the novel?

248
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,370
It's indeed good

249
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,600
with a good title.

250
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,320
Since you like

251
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,720
the novel,

252
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,680
I need to work hard

253
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,130
to be the No.1 husband

254
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:17,840
in your mind.

255
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,080
Let's go home.

256
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,290
It's a good idea.

257
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,290
You...

258
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,410
I bought you much food.

259
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,890
I'll make you some soup.

260
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's go.

261
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,050
Alright, this is the last dish

262
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
ginseng chicken soup.

263
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
Zheng, let's enjoy the meal.

264
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,800
You worked hard, daring.

265
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,840
No.

266
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,050
Let's have a taste.

267
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,650
Taste it when it's still hot.

268
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,440
Here.

269
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,290
What's wrong?

270
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,680
Let me help you.

271
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,720
Take care.

272
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
You can hit me,

273
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,170
but can't eat a meal?

274
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,890
How about it?

275
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,490
One more taste.

276
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,650
What do you want to eat?

277
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,410
I'll feed you.

278
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,170
This one or that one?

279
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Purple yam?

280
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,440
This one?

281
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,440
That's enough.

282
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,410
I can't bear it.

283
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,680
I don't want to eat.

284
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,490
Don't bother us.

285
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,170
You are so

286
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
suitable.

287
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,650
Zheng, what do you want?

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,440
I can feed you.

289
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,490
This one.

290
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,170
This one?

291
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,800
Here.

292
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,290
You have drunk the medicine.

293
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,170
Just have a rest early.

294
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
I gotta go.

295
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,600
What's wrong?

296
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,370
Does it hurt?

297
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:00,920
No.

298
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,680
You shall go.

299
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,560
No.

300
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,010
What if

301
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,800
you hurt again?

302
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,010
Or

303
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
you can tell me a story.

304
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,960
Maybe

305
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,770
I'll be sleepy when listening to it.

306
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,960
Okay.

307
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,530
I'll tell you a story

308
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,840
in Bamboo Annals

309
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,130
you always read.

310
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,800
That's so boring.

311
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,650
Which one do you like?

312
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,130
This one.

313
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,600
Why is it here?

314
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,320
You like it.

315
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,440
Of course, I'll buy it

316
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,770
and learn from it

317
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,370
to win your favor.

318
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,320
No.

319
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,600
I want to listen to this novel.

320
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,050
Alright.

321
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,800
I'll tell you the story.

322
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
Mr Xu said,

323
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,290
"As long as you're alright,

324
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,290
I am willing to do anything."

325
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,840
You worked hard all day long for me.

326
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,530
It's my fault

327
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,490
to ask you to tell me a story.

328
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,800
It's my fault

329
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,290
that you were hurt.

330
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,770
No.

331
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,600
Because of you,

332
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,920
I didn't descent into hell.

333
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,720
I have punished the rogues

334
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,050
that offended you.

335
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,410
I'm Xu Yifei.

336
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,800
Can I know

337
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,490
your name?

338
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,720
Baiwan

339
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,680
Don't remember

340
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,010
your past.

341
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,840
Although you didn't

342
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,840
remember me five years ago,

343
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,130
I just hope

344
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,650
you can

345
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
live a happy life

346
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,680
like this.

347
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,410
Young Mrs.

348
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,410
It's time for meal.

349
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,600
Young Mrs.

350
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,440
Are you

351
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,440
writing novels again?

352
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,840
No.

353
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,410
I'm writing a letter to my dad.

354
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,530
Okay.

355
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,080
Young Mrs.

356
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,530
Just listen to me.

357
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,320
Don't

358
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,440
write novels again

359
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,720
in the future.

360
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,370
That's all.

361
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,080
I shall go.

362
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,650
No.

363
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,170
It's too dangerous to write novels here.

364
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:19,839
Qiuer

365
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,200
Yes?

366
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,490
Nothing.

367
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,720
Jueming

368
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,320
Ask the cook

369
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,440
to prepare two dishes of cakes

370
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,770
for young Mrs.

371
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,530
Don't let her be hungry again.

372
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,680
Okay.

373
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,050
I heard that Miss Jin

374
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,250
is obedient these days.

375
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,410
Thanks to your discipline,

376
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,010
Muqiu is obedient.

377
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,170
In these days,

378
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,800
she was learning needlework

379
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,770
in her room.

380
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,410
As for her behaviors,

381
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,920
she's more dignified than before.

382
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,530
Since she's in our Taoyuan Valley,

383
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
it's a must to be dignified.

384
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,320
It's not appropriate to be crazy.

385
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,410
Mother

386
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
It's windy outside.

387
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,050
What about having a rest in the room?

388
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,410
Why are you hiding me?

389
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,170
What's it?

390
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,490
Mrs.

391
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,290
These are the novels of Miss Jin.

392
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,440
What do you want to do?

393
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,770
Such stuff

394
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,530
can't occur in our Taoyuan Valley.

395
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,930
Fenger, fire them.

396
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
You want to fire my novels?

397
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,840
No way.

398
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,210
Mother

399
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,320
It's indeed her fault to write novels.

400
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,360
But such punishment

401
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,600
is too serious.

402
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,640
We Taoyuan Valley

403
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,560
won't bear them.

404
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,360
Mother

405
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,490
As Young Master of Valley,

406
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,010
do you want to shield her?

407
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,080
Take her away.

408
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,290
Young Mrs.

409
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,560
Don't touch me.

410
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,600
That's my stuff.

411
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,770
Don't fire it.

412
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,770
I spent a lot of time on it.

413
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,970
Fenger, you fire it.

414
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,010
What are you waiting for?

415
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,120
No.

416
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,880
If I don't fire them,

417
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,450
mother won't forgive

418
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,160
Qiuer.

419
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,050
Qiuer

420
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,210
If you're angry,

421
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,080
just be angry at me.

422
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
It's my fault.

423
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,560
Please don't fire them.

424
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,320
No.

425
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:53,930
Young Mrs.

426
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
No, it's my fault.

427
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,320
I can do anything

428
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,250
as long as you don't fire them.

429
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,770
Don't fire them.

430
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,210
No.

431
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,250
No. No.

432
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,250
No.

433
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,530
No.

434
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,930
No.

435
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,770
Rules in Taoyuan Valley

436
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,210
are right?

437
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,080
Why do I feel so sad

438
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,080
when I obey them?

439
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,490
You indulge her too much

440
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,690
so that she can do such things.

441
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,250
If you don't teach your wife,

442
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,490
I'll do it for you.

443
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,640
Come with me.

444
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,450
Release me.

445
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,490
Are you okay?

446
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,050
Young Mrs.

447
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,770
Just listen to me.

448
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,880
Don't mind it.

449
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,010
After all,

450
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,490
you will live a whole life

451
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,160
in the Taoyuan Valley.

452
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,600
A whole life?

453
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,450
You're the wife of Young Master of Valley.

454
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,560
That's for sure.

455
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,120
No.

456
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,770
I can't live a whole life here.

457
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,880
Young Mrs.

458
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,970
Young Master of Valley

459
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,930
It was her fault.

460
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,320
Why are you

461
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,400
punished for her?

462
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,730
You got the caning

463
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
and are copying women's commandments for her.

464
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,160
That's too much.

465
00:22:59,290 --> 00:22:59,800
Jueming

466
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,930
Young Master of Valley

467
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,930
There's bad news.

468
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,600
Young Mrs. wrote a letter for you and left.

469
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,360
I'm gone.

470
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,530
You Taoyuan Valley people have pushed me too far.

471
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,970
You can regard it as we have divorced peacefully.

472
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,560
From now on, we're strangers.

473
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,730
This...

474
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm supporting you.

475
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
You should have energy now,

476
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,730
But

477
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,010
you're painstaking.

478
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,600
No.

479
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,320
You should have recovered.

480
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,320
How could it become serious?

481
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,080
No.

482
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,290
You were hurt in the chest,

483
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,600
not the lags.

484
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,490
And last night,

485
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,010
you picked me up and sent me to my room.

486
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,770
You finally discovered.

487
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,210
You cheat me again.

488
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,450
It's you who asked to

489
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,210
support me

490
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,400
to go for a walk outside.

491
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,640
I have no fault.

492
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,250
I know.

493
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,730
If you hurt,

494
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,080
you'll say nothing.

495
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,400
You look sick

496
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,160
and ask me to do a lot of things,

497
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,400
so you must have recovered.

498
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,050
You know me a lot.

499
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,160
You're a cunning fox.

500
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,320
So,

501
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,450
since you're alright,

502
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
I want to go back to Jin's Escort Agency.

503
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,530
Last time,

504
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,400
when we left Taoyuan Valley,

505
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,160
I didn't

506
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,530
even tell Head Escort Jin.

507
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,640
You wanna leave?

508
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,640
Okay.

509
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,250
I won't leave.

510
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,050
I won't leave.

511
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,730
I won't leave.

512
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,640
You want to go back to Jin's Escort Agency

513
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
for a long time.

514
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,800
It seems that

515
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,970
our Tingqin Garden is not good enough.

516
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,080
Of course, Tingqin Garden is good.

517
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,600
But I can cook everyday

518
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,010
in the Jin's Escort Agency.

519
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,320
I don't know what to do

520
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,320
here.

521
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,400
You're a cook in Jin's Escort Agency.

522
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,560
In Tingqin Garden,

523
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,930
you're my wife.

524
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,640
It doesn't matter what you should do.

525
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,210
You should think about

526
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,050
what you can do with me.

527
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,080
According to Miss Jin's novels,

528
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,770
we are

529
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,930
couples

530
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,290
now.

531
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,560
So have you figured out

532
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,800
what you want to do

533
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,250
with your love?

534
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,050
I can do whatever

535
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,050
I want to do?

536
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,050
Sure.

537
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,840
I have

538
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,210
a husband now.

539
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,450
But what should

540
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,050
couples do?

541
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,050
That's it.

542
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,290
I have read

543
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,250
a lot of novels.

544
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,970
I can learn from them.

545
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,530
This plot is good.

546
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
I'll copy it.

547
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,450
Are these what you want to do?

548
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,840
But actually, I don't know.

549
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,360
I just read Miss Jin's novels,

550
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,320
and I want to

551
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,800
try them.

552
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,400
Okay, I can do

553
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,800
these things with you.

554
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,640
Really?

555
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,530
Then, let's begin with the first one.

556
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,010
In the novels,

557
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,160
couples would

558
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,120
mold clay figurine

559
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,640
of each other in their minds

560
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,010
and form them by firing.

561
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,490
That's the love token.

562
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,770
I want to try it.

563
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,490
Shall we start?

564
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,080
Okay.

565
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:03,880
I will mold a figure

566
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,290
more handsome than you.

567
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
You can be relieved.

568
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,600
Don't steal a glance at mine.

569
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
You can't steal a glance at mine, either.

570
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,290
I didn't steal a glance at yours.

571
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,690
I just looked at it.

572
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,210
Yours is ugly.

573
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,770
But it's you,

574
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,010
Baiwan.

575
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,730
Are you saying that

576
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,770
you're ugly?

577
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,250
I'm not ugly.

578
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:07,970
You...

579
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,210
Mine is ugly.

580
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm done.

581
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,560
Me, too.

582
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,050
Let's disclose them.

583
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,080
One, two, three.

584
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:25,840
Disclose.

585
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,210
You mold a rabbit.

586
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
You mold

587
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,640
a cunning fox.

588
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,120
But your rabbit

589
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,120
is better than my cunning fox.

590
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,360
So,

591
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,400
in the future,

592
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,840
the cunning fox will listen to

593
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
the rabbit, okay?

594
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,290
Okay.

595
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,290
The cunning fox

596
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,050
will only listen to Baiwan.

597
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,490
I don't expect that Lord

598
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,800
really molds figures.

599
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,320
Our Tingqin Garden has established for three years.

600
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,450
It's the first time that

601
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,560
I see Lord is such happy.

602
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,560
No.

603
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,600
I'm going to cook the dinner.

604
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,490
He's seduced by Baiwan.

605
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,840
So

606
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,160
love is harmful.

607
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,290
Otherwise,

608
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,600
even Lord

609
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,690
would fail.

610
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,080
Miss Jin said that there is a wishing tree

611
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,640
outside the Furong Town.

612
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,010
Since we can't go there

613
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,840
to have a look at it,

614
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,730
we can make a wish to the sky lantern.

615
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,730
Miss Jin's novels also

616
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,770
have such a plot.

617
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,450
What wishes do you want to make?

618
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,360
I have a lot of wishes.

619
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,400
I wish you

620
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
to recover as soon as possible.

621
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I wish you

622
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,360
don't get hurt anymore.

623
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,730
I wish Miss Jin

624
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,600
and all people in Jin's Escort Agency

625
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,530
can live a peaceful

626
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,560
and happy life.

627
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,930
I wish all people of Tingqin Garden

628
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,320
to be healthy and happy, too.

629
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,560
I also wish Puyuan Canon case

630
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,320
can be investigated clearly

631
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,290
so that people will know that Jin's Escort Agency is innocent.

632
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,450
It's your turn.

633
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,080
I have no wish.

634
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,600
Why?

635
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,080
Everyone has their wishes.

636
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,250
I used to have one.

637
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,120
But I have achieved it.

638
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,360
So I think

639
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,600
I can work hard

640
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,320
to achieve other wishes.

641
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,010
I'm afraid God may punish me

642
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,690
because of my greed.

643
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,600
Is your wish related to me?

644
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,930
Sure.

645
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,120
So you don't make a wish?

646
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
Let's release the sky lanterns.

647
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,450
Okay.

648
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,120
I have another wish.

649
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,080
I forgot it.

650
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,800
I wish

651
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,010
I can remember my past,

652
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,360
so that I

653
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,930
have all my memories.

654
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,250
But you said,

655
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,250
you don't want to

656
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,360
remember the one who hurts you.

657
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,290
I don't want to remember him.

658
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,600
But

659
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,080
maybe he's not my family.

660
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,010
I just

661
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,490
want to know my family

662
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,930
and find them as soon as possible.

663
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,080
Then, I can see them with you.

664
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,080
Okay.

665
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,290
Aren't you cold?

666
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,530
I won't be cold.

667
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,530
This time,

668
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,770
what do you want to try?

669
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,930
Rainy days.

670
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
Many couples in novels

671
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,450
are met and fall in love with each other

672
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,730
in romantic rainy days.

673
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,490
So I want to try it.

674
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,690
Okay.

675
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,250
We'll wait for a rainy day.

676
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,560
Everything is just alike five years ago.

677
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,840
Baiwan

678
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,880
I hope you can be happy

679
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,320
forever.

680
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,250
Although it doesn't rain,

681
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,640
it snows.

682
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,400
I only focused on the battles

683
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,560
in novels

684
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,010
of Miss Jin.

685
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,400
I didn't expect...

686
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,770
Being with the one you love,

687
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,010
it's also happy

688
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,160
to do the stupid things.

689
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,640
There is a guy

690
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,770
who is willing to do the stupid things with me.

691
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,930
It's so good.

692
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,490
I also think so.

693
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,840
Which part do you think is good?

694
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,930
It's good to meet you.

695
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,160
Then, one of my wishes

696
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,290
is achieved.

697
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,800
Is that easy?

698
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,770
Although it's not a rainy day,

699
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,800
it's a snowy day

700
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,450
which is more romantic.

701
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,970
What a coincidence!

702
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,970
Last night,

703
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,490
I read the novel you like.

704
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,930
On such days,

705
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,320
couples should

706
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,450
do this...
