00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,140
Young Master

4
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,300
Even though you come here,

5
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,979
it's useless.

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,820
Besides, this time Miss Jin

7
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,300
is willing to go to the Tingqin Garden.

8
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,539
She will go out.

9
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,820
I will just be here to wait for her.

10
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,780
I shouldn't have respected him so much.

11
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,300
It surprises me that Qu Zheng

12
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,180
is such a vile person.

13
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,020
But unfortunately,

14
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,820
I have already promised him.

15
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,740
Otherwise, I would have

16
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,380
exposed him.

17
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,300
But now the most important thing is

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,300
to go to the Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake

19
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,740
and get Lingyao Herb for Baiwan.

20
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,820
But there are only three people of us.

21
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,860
How can we win the reward for the champion?

22
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,980
Getting the herb to regain my memory

23
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,820
is my own business.

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,620
I don't want to trouble you again.

25
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,780
Never speak like that.

26
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,780
It was me who told you

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,579
about the matter of Lingyao Herb.

28
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,900
Besides, I, Su Zhuozhuo, the highly-skilled doctor,

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,260
have promised you that

30
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,420
I will cure your amnesia.

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,900
If I can't keep my words,

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
I will be ashamed.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,180
That's it.

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,860
Your business is my business.

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
I will help you.

36
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,380
If you dare

37
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,380
to speak such meaningless words again,

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,060
I will never speak to you anymore.

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,060
Me too.

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,579
Alright.

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,820
I see.

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,940
I won't say

43
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,060
such meaningless words again.

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Then I will remember

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,860
your kindness forever.

46
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,220
That's it.

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,460
According to the information,

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,580
you might really be

49
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,620
the disciple of Nonuple Palace.

50
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,780
How about you

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,860
seek help from the Nonuple Palace?

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,220
Ask them to help you get the herb.

53
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,580
I can't

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,820
easily trust anyone again.

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,820
I have to get the herb

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,540
with my own effort.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,260
No.

58
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,780
It should be

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,540
with our effort.

60
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,579
Let's get the Lingyao Herb.

61
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,140
Come on. Let's go.

62
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,780
Let's go.

63
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,220
Young Master

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,900
You have stayed up all night again.

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,660
Let's go back to the town and have a rest.

66
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,420
Then we should make another plan.

67
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,660
Qiuer

68
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,780
Qiuer

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,100
Why are you still here?

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,380
The Young Master

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,420
has been waiting for you here

72
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,460
for three days without sleeping.

73
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,340
You're so heartless.

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,900
Jueming

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,260
You shouldn't have been like this.

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,540
It's not important,

77
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,060
as long as you can come out.

78
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,620
You told me before that

79
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,700
I didn't understand the real reason

80
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,420
why you left Taoyuan Valley.

81
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,220
Now I think I can understand.

82
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,780
You're kind and simple,

83
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,740
and even naive.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,060
So you had a conflict

85
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,100
with my mother.

86
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,100
Don't worry. In the future,

87
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,420
I will try to resolve

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,500
the conflict between you and my mother.

89
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,020
Mr Yu

90
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,260
I have told you everything.

91
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,220
Why can't you understand?

92
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,860
Qiuer

93
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,820
I already swallow my pride

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,660
to discuss with you.

95
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,940
Why are you so heartless?

96
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,740
I said

97
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,860
you can't understand me.

98
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,140
How can I understand you

99
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,100
when you refuse to communicate with me?

100
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,380
Don't shout so loudly.

101
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,339
Qiuqiu, don't be scared.

102
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,899
We get your back.

103
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,420
Ladies

104
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,420
It's the family affair of the Yu family.

105
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,020
Please do not disturb us.

106
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,900
Qiuer

107
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,820
As long as you can go back with me,

108
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,780
I will take

109
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
all the responsibilities.

110
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,820
Mr Yu

111
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,380
It was you who made a mistake first.

112
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,060
You shouldn't

113
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,980
talk to Miss Muqiu like this.

114
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,580
Me?

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,780
What mistake did the Young Master make?

116
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,900
He did make it.

117
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,020
Qiuqiu took such a long trip

118
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,060
to marry into Taoyuan Valley.

119
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,100
You didn't cherish her,

120
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,940
and even bullied her

121
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,620
together with your mother.

122
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,580
Isn't it a mistake?

123
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,140
I didn't bully her.

124
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,460
She was living a cautious life

125
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,820
in Taoyuan Valley.

126
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,060
Do you have any idea about this?

127
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,900
To satisfy you, she has learned

128
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,460
so many rules,

129
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,980
and memorized so many poetry and canons.

130
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,460
But you were still not satisfied.

131
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,540
Do you want to change her

132
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,740
into a puppet in Taoyuan Valley?

133
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,540
Everyone likes her novels.

134
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,060
But you just set them on fire.

135
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,780
Yeah.

136
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,020
That's not bullying,

137
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,100
but abuse.

138
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,340
Abuse the new bride.

139
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Do you still want

140
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,700
to take her back to Taoyuan Valley?

141
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,900
Qiuqiu, don't speak so much to him.

142
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,340
Let's go.

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,260
Qiuer

144
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,620
You have no need to follow me.

145
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,380
Jueming

146
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,580
Everything they said

147
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,260
is the truth?

148
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,420
Is it really all my mistake?

149
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,140
It...

150
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,700
Young Master

151
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,780
You didn't make any mistake.

152
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,460
Rules lead everything.

153
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,420
All of these

154
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,700
are Miss Jin's mistakes.

155
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,540
But as her husband,

156
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,740
I even didn't know

157
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,380
she was so unhappy every day.

158
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,860
Isn't it a mistake?

159
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,220
Young Master

160
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,260
Even if you say this now,

161
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,020
it's useless.

162
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,500
Miss Jin has made up her mind

163
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,820
to divorce you.

164
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,540
We should go back first.

165
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,620
No.

166
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,100
Since it's my mistake,

167
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,540
I should go to find her again.

168
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,940
Young Master

169
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
We have walked for such a long time.

170
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,940
We should find a place

171
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,660
to have a rest first.

172
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,340
I agree.

173
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,500
That's a good idea.

174
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,100
Waiter, a pot of tea.

175
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,740
Okay.

176
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,900
Here you are.

177
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,460
Put it here.

178
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,580
Enjoy yourselves.

179
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,060
Look,

180
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,060
is that Yu Linfeng?

181
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,580
Why are there always flies

182
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,340
following us everywhere?

183
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
It's disgusting.

184
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,900
Ladies,

185
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,900
I have thought about

186
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,700
the words you have said before.

187
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Indeed,

188
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,420
it was my mistake.

189
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm here to make a sincere apology.

190
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,740
Miss Muqiu

191
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,540
I dare not hope Qiuer

192
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,500
to forgive me at once.

193
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Ladies

194
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,820
It's dangerous on the road.

195
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,260
So I will escort you.

196
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,460
We don't need your protection,

197
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,380
or your escort.

198
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,300
Miss Jin, you...

199
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,780
Jueming

200
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,980
Nothing, nothing. It's nothing.

201
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,860
Dear guests

202
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,260
Would you like to taste the special dessert?

203
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,420
All of them are delicate cakes.

204
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,380
It's not expensive.

205
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,260
Just five coins for one plate of it.

206
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,540
Come on. Taste it.

207
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,900
Such delicate cakes only cost five coins?

208
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,340
Yes. Just five coins.

209
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,380
Please try it first.

210
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,659
Wait.

211
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,180
Do you have Snow Tea here?

212
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,780
Yes, we have.

213
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,660
And fried hazelnuts?

214
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,260
Yes, we have.

215
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,300
And Peach Crisp?

216
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,620
Don't worry. We have everything

217
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,380
that you want.

218
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm gonna take them for you.

219
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
It's weird.

220
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,340
How can such a remote inn

221
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,260
have so many delicate cakes?

222
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,500
It's weird. Really weird.

223
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,900
They are also all what we like.

224
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,420
It seems that

225
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,660
someone has prepared it for us.

226
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,660
Miss Muqiu

227
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,980
It turns out that Mr Yu

228
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,260
is really making a sincere apology.

229
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,940
But I won't

230
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,940
forgive him so easily.

231
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,460
Then...

232
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,500
We keep ignoring him.

233
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,740
Of course.

234
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,340
Fine.

235
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
I knew you're here.

236
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,700
I come with dessert for you.

237
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,220
Thank you, Chu.

238
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,380
Lift your feet.

239
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,940
Lift your feet.

240
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
Qingyun, are you okay?

241
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm fine.

242
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,620
Your wound hasn't recovered yet.

243
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,140
Don't hang around.

244
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,260
You're not qualified
to care about my business.

245
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm here to send you the Majesty's order.

246
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,460
The Majesty orders you

247
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,740
to attend the Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake

248
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,580
on behalf of the Nonuple Palace.

249
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,620
My father always attaches
great importance to this event,

250
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,700
why does he suddenly

251
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,700
order me, the sinner being punished,

252
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,460
to attend it on behalf of the Nonuple Palace?

253
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,740
The representative

254
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,780
should be Envoy Xueyue

255
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,180
who he always likes much.

256
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,460
The Host places great hope on you.

257
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,500
He hopes you can

258
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,420
win the champion for us.

259
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,140
As for me,

260
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,660
I should take another order.

261
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,660
What's the reward of the champion?

262
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,540
Lingyao Herb.

263
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,900
Lingyao Herb?

264
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,740
Yes.

265
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,020
The poison in Chu's body is Wangyou Poison.

266
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,580
Lingyao Herb is the only item

267
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,620
that can be the antidote.

268
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,180
As long as I get the herb,

269
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,260
Chu will regain her memory.

270
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,220
I've sent you the order.

271
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,300
Young Host, just help yourself.

272
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,700
Wait.

273
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,540
Do you know what Wangyou Poison is?

274
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,260
Yes, I know.

275
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,300
You should know it.

276
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,780
To prevent you from betraying him,

277
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,340
he also set the same poison in your body.

278
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,540
If you don't follow his words,

279
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,260
you will be the same as Chu,

280
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,780
who has lost all memories.

281
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,220
In that case,

282
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,780
will you still be loyal to him?

283
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,460
I said that

284
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,300
the Majesty has saved my life.

285
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,460
As long as he orders me,

286
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
I must obey.

287
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,740
You know what.

288
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
That's just why

289
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,220
you can't be comparable to her.

290
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,220
Your Majesty

291
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,220
I have sent your order

292
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,820
to the Young Host.

293
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,700
He has taken the order.

294
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,180
As long as he gets Lingyao Herb,

295
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,420
he can help Chu

296
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,380
to regain the memory.

297
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,180
He won't refuse it.

298
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
You must be curious about

299
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,100
why I give Chu

300
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,700
a chance to regain her memory.

301
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,100
She knows too much.

302
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,340
Once she regains her memory,

303
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,620
we can't accept the consequence.

304
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,740
Do you really think

305
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
Lingyao Herb

306
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,260
is for Chu?

307
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,460
It's for Qu Zheng?

308
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,100
I will make you

309
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,220
the judge of this competition.

310
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,580
After you become the judge,

311
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,460
watch Qu Zheng closely.

312
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,460
I understand.

313
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,860
I won't let Qu Zheng

314
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,420
make any trouble.

315
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,980
No, you must

316
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,020
make him enter the final competition.

317
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,340
But...

318
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,940
If he enters the final competition,

319
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
he will fight against

320
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,060
the Young Host.

321
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,700
I

322
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,380
just want to watch this fighting.

323
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,300
Are you full?

324
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,260
I'm gonna pay the bill.

325
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,060
Go.

326
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,100
It's my turn next time.

327
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,100
Waiter, the money.

328
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,260
Jueming

329
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,780
The Young Master

330
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,060
has paid your bill.

331
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,260
Who asked you to pay for it?

332
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,180
We can pay for it ourselves.

333
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,060
Well...

334
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,340
No, Miss Jin. Please don't be so stubborn.

335
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,020
No, we don't want it.

336
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,340
Yes, we don't want it.

337
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,660
We don't want your dirty money.

338
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,580
Take it away. Take it away.

339
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,980
Do you want

340
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,980
to satisfy Qiuqiu in this way?

341
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,940
It's ridiculous.

342
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,540
We're not that poor.

343
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,700
Arrogant thief.

344
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,980
My bag.

345
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,980
My bag.

346
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,060
Give it back to me.

347
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,980
Baiwan

348
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,460
Are you okay?

349
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:50,940
I'm fine.

350
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,580
Are you okay?

351
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,140
Hair clasp.

352
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,540
My hair clasp is still in the bag.

353
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,300
Baiwan

354
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,700
Young Master, Miss Jin has run away.

355
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,300
Catch her up.

356
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,140
Baiwan

357
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,580
Be careful.

358
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,700
Baiwan

359
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,820
Wait for me.

360
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,380
Fortunately, I get it back.

361
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,660
Ladies

362
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,380
It's dangerous for you

363
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,340
to meet such bandits on the road.

364
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,380
Let me escort you.

365
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Alright.

366
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,940
You can

367
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,020
escort us.

368
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,020
After you.

369
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,820
Let's go.

370
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,980
Young Master, let's go.

371
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,900
Be gentle, Zhuozhuo.

372
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,220
She doesn't know the pain.

373
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,660
Didn't she want to

374
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,100
break up with Qu Zheng?

375
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,380
Now she got herself wounded

376
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,380
just because of the hair clasp from him.

377
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,020
It was not because of him.

378
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,260
Zhuozhuo

379
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,460
Don't blame Baiwan.

380
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,380
Baiwan's wrist is hurt now.

381
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,900
What should we do in the competition?

382
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,660
There are all skilled masters.

383
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,420
With her rough skills,

384
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,740
I don't think

385
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
she can win the reward.

386
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,620
I...

387
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,100
We're also here.

388
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,980
We?

389
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Not we.

390
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,940
My father said that

391
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,620
I have to serve as a doctor there.

392
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,260
Of course, I can't attend the competition.

393
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Then what should we do?

394
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,060
Do you know why

395
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,460
I agreed to

396
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,900
let Mr Yu

397
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,340
follow us?

398
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,580
So you asked Mr Yu here

399
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
to help us.

400
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,900
But,

401
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,380
will he agree to that?

402
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,060
It depends on

403
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,100
if Miss Jin

404
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,580
is good at flattering a man.

405
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,780
You want me to flatter him?

406
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,300
No way.

407
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,060
Thanks.

408
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,940
Thank you, sir.

409
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,500
Young Master

410
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,380
Young Master

411
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,340
What's wrong?

412
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,420
Good news.

413
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,740
What good news?

414
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,180
I just sent

415
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,060
medicine to Miss Jin.

416
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,380
And I eavesdropped that they...

417
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,100
Eavesdropped?

418
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,900
Jueming

419
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,140
It's not the style of Taoyuan Valley

420
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,220
to eavesdrop.

421
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,340
Well... You're right.

422
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,220
The... The news

423
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,180
is about Miss Jin and you.

424
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,580
Then I can't speak it out.

425
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,380
I can't speak.

426
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,860
Since it is about Qiuer,

427
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,340
then,

428
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
I will forgive you this time.

429
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,579
Young Master

430
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,540
I heard that

431
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,540
they are not

432
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,980
gonna go back to Jin's Escort Agency,

433
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,940
but attend the Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake.

434
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,300
Battle...

435
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,619
Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake?

436
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,020
This time, they want

437
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,099
to help Miss Jin

438
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,420
get the reward of the champion,

439
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,020
Lingyao Herb.

440
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,180
They know they are not skilled enough.

441
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,700
So they want to invite you

442
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,579
to fight for them.

443
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,260
Me?

444
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,980
But what does Lingyao Herb

445
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,500
has to do with Qiuer?

446
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,060
Young Master

447
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,060
Just think about it.

448
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,660
Since the Young Mrs

449
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,220
wants you to take part in the competition,

450
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,940
you can take this opportunity

451
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,060
to let her go back to Taoyuan Valley.

452
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,740
It's not righteous

453
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,220
to threaten her with this matter.

454
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,740
I... Then I...

455
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,820
Young Master

456
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,420
Being righteous or getting her back,

457
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,660
you can make a choice yourself.

458
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,260
Young Master

459
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,740
She is coming.

460
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,220
Young Mrs is coming.

461
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,620
Keep calm. You can do it.

462
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,860
You're the best. Keep it up.

463
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,500
Good morning, Miss Muqiu.

464
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,660
Miss Muqiu

465
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,740
Shu

466
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,180
Mr Yu

467
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,300
Thank you for helping Baiwan today.

468
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,980
Since Baiwan is your friend,

469
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,780
it's my duty to help her.

470
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,820
Oh, by the way,

471
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,580
the carriage is prepared.

472
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,980
Then you will

473
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,940
be safer on the road.

474
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,820
Actually, I want to say...

475
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,060
Just speak it out.

476
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,660
I want to say...

477
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,620
As long as you want,

478
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,260
I will do it.

479
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,740
Miss Muqiu

480
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,660
Miss Muqiu

481
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,420
I want to say

482
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,580
thank you

483
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,500
for your preparation in the teahouse.

484
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,540
Teahouse?

485
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,860
Anyway,

486
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,340
as long as you want,

487
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,020
I will try my best to satisfy you.

488
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,060
Then...

489
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,780
It's chilly at night,

490
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,580
so go back to your room early.

491
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,020
Miss Muqiu, so do you.

492
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,500
Go back to have a rest early.

493
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,700
So...

494
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,340
I'm gonna go back.

495
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,460
After you.

496
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay.

497
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,780
Is it that smooth?

498
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,780
Did you ask him?

499
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,740
Look at me.

500
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,340
Did you ask him?

501
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,940
No.

502
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,860
Why?

503
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,420
I...

504
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
I'm afraid that

505
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,500
Baiwan won't agree to it.

506
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,620
But what should we do?

507
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,980
What if she even can't

508
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,860
enter the knockout stage?

509
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,660
It will be so ashamed.

510
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,180
Why is there a notch?

511
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,140
Where is it?

512
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,500
Miss

513
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,780
Are you sleeping?

514
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,820
No. Please come in.

515
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,700
Miss

516
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,540
We heard that

517
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,100
you got your wrist injured.

518
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,060
We

519
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,340
especially send you

520
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,380
the medicine for the sprain.

521
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,220
Okay. Thanks.

522
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,500
If you don't have any demands,

523
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,020
I will leave.

524
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,260
Please call me if you need anything.

525
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,500
Wait.

526
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,460
Who prepared this medicine for me?

527
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,020
It...

528
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,380
Of course, it was

529
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,780
my shopkeeper.

530
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,660
He always teaches us that

531
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,780
we should make guests

532
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,820
feel easy like at home.

533
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,460
So I will go first.

534
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,900
Medicine.

535
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,860
It's strange.

536
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,780
Who is it?

537
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,540
It's weird.

538
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,900
How can such a remote inn

539
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,700
have so many delicate cakes?

540
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,380
It's weird. Really weird.

541
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,980
All the villains

542
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,260
should have been cleaned on the way.

543
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,260
But there were still

544
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,900
two foolish thieves.

545
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,620
I have sent them back

546
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,380
to Tingqin Garden.

547
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,260
Is there any subordinate from Nonuple Palace?

548
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,180
No.

549
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,940
They might

550
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,540
haven't found

551
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,340
Miss Jin's location yet.

552
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,500
We can't let them find.

553
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,180
Now,

554
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,940
she will only be safe

555
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,220
if she goes to the
Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake.

556
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:18,860
Zheng

557
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Don't be so worried.

558
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,500
So many people

559
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,500
are going with her along the way.

560
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,940
She will be fine.

561
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,380
Even I am not fine,

562
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,820
how can she be fine.

563
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
Since you miss her so much,

564
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,900
you should directly meet her.

565
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,700
Don't worry.

566
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,300
I will meet her soon.

567
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,140
Great weapons.

568
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,460
Take a look.

569
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,540
Dear customers

570
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,220
The great weapons.

571
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,340
Take a look.

572
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,340
Just buy it.

573
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,740
Is it strong and durable?

574
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,660
So this is the Lake Town.

575
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,020
Finally, we are here.

576
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,860
This is the most important event

577
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,700
of the martial arts world.

578
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,580
It's held by the Alliance of Martial Arts.

579
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,220
People can learn from each other

580
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,980
in the competition.

581
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,100
It is also used to

582
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,660
solve the conflicts.

583
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,900
Certainly, it should be grand.

584
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,060
How can a martial arts competition

585
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,740
solve the conflicts?

586
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,060
Do you know the Martial Arts Bet?

587
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,060
I don't know.

588
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,580
I know it.

589
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,060
Martial Arts Bet

590
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,100
is like the chips of gambling.

591
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,500
Before every round,

592
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,300
the two competitors should set one thing

593
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,300
that they want the other one to do for them,

594
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,980
or one item that they want

595
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,220
the other one to give them.

596
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,860
So, except for those martial artists,

597
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,860
many other people also

598
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,860
take part in the game.

599
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,620
Yes.

600
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,540
But not everyone

601
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,860
has the opportunity to set the bet.

602
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,420
Before the round competition,

603
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,540
there will be a knockout stage.

604
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,580
Only the competitors
who can pass the knockout stage

605
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,180
can be qualified to
take part in the round competition.

606
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,580
So be it.

607
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,540
But I found that

608
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,100
there are not only martial artists outside.

609
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,780
Yes.

610
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,540
It's such a grand event,

611
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,660
which is also a good opportunity

612
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,460
for the merchants to sell.

613
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,140
I have the duty.

614
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,660
Mr Yu

615
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,700
Stop the carriage.

616
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,860
I gotta go.

617
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,660
Thanks.

618
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,540
Come on.

619
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,020
Thanks.

620
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,220
I have to register in the Lake Manor.

621
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,220
You guys just hang around first.

622
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,660
Go.

623
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,940
Are you okay?

624
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,300
I...

625
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,740
I want to hang around with Baiwan.

626
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,860
Let me go with you.

627
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,860
I don't want to go with the two of you.

628
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,980
I'm gonna hang around myself.

629
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,300
In that case,

630
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,740
Qiuer...

631
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,380
The blessing amulet.

632
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,740
The blessing amulet.

633
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,820
Ladies and gentlemen

634
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,540
Since you come here to attend the competition,

635
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,420
you'd better buy a blessing amulet

636
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,980
to bless you.

637
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,300
The blessing amulet?

638
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,180
Miss

639
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,380
Did you get a marriage lot

640
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,300
from me before?

641
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,740
Hey, it's really you.

642
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,340
How lucky.

643
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,180
I'm so lucky to meet you again.

644
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
Where is your husband?

645
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,060
He is not my husband.

646
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,420
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

647
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,940
You're also here

648
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,460
to attend the competition, aren't you?

649
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,180
How about buying a blessing amulet

650
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,540
to bless you?

651
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,460
That's good.

652
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,860
Why are you here?

653
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,700
Miss Jin

654
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,700
It's so lucky.

655
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,660
It's not lucky. You just

656
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,620
followed me here on purpose.

657
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,060
No, I didn't.

658
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,060
You're here to attend the competition,

659
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,900
so am I.

660
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,420
I didn't follow you here.

661
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,780
I know you.

662
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,220
You're the husband of this lady.

663
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,940
No.

664
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,780
He is not my husband.

665
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,620
Yeah.

666
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,420
We're both here

667
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,460
for the Lingyao Herb.

668
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,140
We should be opponents.

669
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,540
So I'm not her husband.

670
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,100
Are you also here for the Lingyao Herb?

671
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:25,860
Sir

672
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Look. Qu Zheng and that girl.

673
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,220
How dare they come to the competition?

674
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:30,980
Let's go.

675
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,420
Qu Zheng

676
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,780
You disguised as a music master

677
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,060
to fool me.

678
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,820
How dare you come here?

679
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,340
Mr Yu Chen, please tell me

680
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,380
why I shouldn't be here.

681
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,580
The Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake

682
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,500
is co-organized by the Nonuple Palace this time.

683
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,180
You two should remember

684
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,060
not to let any trouble happen.

685
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,060
Yes,

686
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,340
Your Majesty.

687
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,180
Report.

688
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,060
Your Majesty

689
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,820
Qu Zheng

690
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,820
and Jin Baiwan are here.

691
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,220
They finally

692
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,780
come here.

693
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,820
Forget about my matters for now.

694
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,820
I heard that

695
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
in Taoyuan Valley,

696
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,420
you have knocked out so many masters,

697
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,540
and in Qingyi Town and Wanlan Town,

698
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,260
you fought against the Nonuple Palace.

699
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,820
How dare you show up again?

700
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,460
I just knocked them out.

701
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,020
Even if I were

702
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,860
a murderous

703
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,220
and merciless killer,

704
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,860
I can still

705
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,940
come to attend the competition.

706
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,540
What Lord Qu said is right.

707
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,020
Host, you came here just in time.

708
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,100
You should be fair

709
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,740
to help me deal with this matter.

710
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,540
Fair?

711
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,380
Let's forget your crime
of hurting people first.

712
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,020
Jin Baiwan is actually

713
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,780
the disciple of Nonuple Palace, Chu.

714
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,940
You have taken away
the disciple of Nonuple Palace

715
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,020
without the Host's permission.

716
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,140
Everyone knows it.

717
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,620
I'm not his disciple. Don't talk nonsense.

718
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,540
What?

719
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,020
Qu Zheng took you to Tingqin Garden,

720
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,020
and fooled by him.

721
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,740
You even don't know who you are.

722
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,380
My wife, Baiwan,

723
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,300
is not the person

724
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,180
Mr Yu keep mentioning.

725
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,700
Besides, do you forget

726
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,580
where you are?

727
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,660
This is the place
of the Battle of Martial Arts by the Lake.

728
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,180
And the Battle is

729
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,020
ruled by the martial arts,

730
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,660
not the words and positions.

731
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,780
So,

732
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,180
no matter whether Lord Qu

733
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,700
has a conflict with the Nonuple Palace,

734
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,740
or whether he has taken away the disciple,

735
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,940
as long as he attends the competition,

736
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
he will be under the Battle's protection.

737
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,380
Darling

738
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,900
You also heard of this.

739
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,020
We're protected by the Battle.

740
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,140
Nonsense. I'm not your wife.

741
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,140
Why are you still

742
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,980
so angry with me, my dear?

743
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,820
Miss

744
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,740
Do you still remember me?

745
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,140
You should be Host Jing Yuan.

746
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,580
But I didn't know you before.

747
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,020
You just said that

748
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,780
all the competitors

749
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,580
are free from trouble.

750
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,940
I'm also here for the competition.

751
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,300
Since the matter here has nothing to do with me,

752
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm gonna leave.

753
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,180
Foolish girl

754
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,060
How dare you escape?

755
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,300
Thanks for being fair.

756
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,980
If you have no other requests,

757
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,660
I also have to go.

758
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,740
Qu Zheng

759
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,220
Host Jing Yuan

760
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,020
I will also go.

761
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,380
Let's go.

762
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,460
Dear guest, please come in.

763
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,860
Please have a look.

764
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,820
Here

765
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,340
is Lake Inn.

766
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
All the competitors

767
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,740
coming here

768
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,740
live in this inn.

769
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
Your room is on the second floor.

770
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:04,940
Let me take you there.

771
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,060
Here is your room.

772
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,580
Oh.

773
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,300
Do all the competitors

774
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,100
live here?

775
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,580
Yes.

776
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,220
All the competitors live here.

777
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,860
Why did you ask this question?

778
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,340
Who do you want to meet

779
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,260
in this inn?

780
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,060
Thanks, dear guest.

781
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,340
It's so lucky.

782
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,420
My room

783
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,380
is just next to your room.

784
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,780
If you want,

785
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,900
you can come to me
and practice your martial arts with me.

786
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,100
The reason you attend the competition

787
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,300
is to prevent me

788
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,580
from getting Lingyao Herb, am I right?

789
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,300
No. On the contrary,

790
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm here to help you

791
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,620
to get Lingyao Herb.

792
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,260
That's impossible.

793
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,620
You must have a conspiracy.

794
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,260
Right?

795
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,220
Conspiracy?

796
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,220
I do have the conspiracy.

797
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,660
My conspiracy is that

798
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,780
Baiwan can go back to Tingqin Garden

799
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,740
as soon as possible,

800
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,180
and continue our wedding.

801
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,540
Never think about it.

802
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,260
I was

803
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,500
the previous champion of the last competition.

804
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,620
It's reasonable for me

805
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,140
to win the competition again.

806
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,980
However, you

807
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,540
just entered this circle.

808
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,660
Without my help,

809
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,940
you can't

810
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,900
get the herb.

811
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,860
I see.

812
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,060
This time,

813
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,420
we are bound to be opponents.

814
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,220
Well...

815
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,020
After you.

816
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,580
Okay.

817
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,100
I first.

818
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,260
Qiuer

819
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,660
I know

820
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,060
the reason you want to attend the competition

821
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,300
is to help Jin Baiwan to get Lingyao Herb.

822
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,020
However, I think

823
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,100
the competition

824
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,140
is too dangerous for you.

825
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,020
How about I replace you to attend it?

826
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,180
Really?

827
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,300
Then...

828
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,780
Do you have

829
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,820
any other requests?

830
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,820
In fact, I have no other request,

831
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,340
but if I win the game

832
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,300
and help Baiwan

833
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,500
to get Lingyao Herb,

834
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,100
you should also

835
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,940
go back to Taoyuan Valley with me,

836
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,260
and make our parents relieved.

837
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,220
You want me to go back

838
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,260
to Taoyuan Valley with you.

839
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,340
Is it because you want me go back

840
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
or you just want

841
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,620
to make your parents relieved?

842
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,140
Of course, I want you to go back.

843
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,900
But

844
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,300
my parents...

845
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,940
Yu Linfeng

846
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,460
I won't

847
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,580
bother you with my business.

848
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,140
Qiuer

849
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,100
As expected, he won't

850
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,140
let me go so easily.

851
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,540
How dare you come here again?

852
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,940
Why are you here?

853
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,540
The Majesty wants to see you.

854
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,180
Young Host

855
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,900
Young Host, the Host orders you

856
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,820
to go back first.

857
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,260
The Majesty is over there.

858
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,460
What?

859
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,620
Jing Yuan invited Baiwan

860
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,260
to the Lake Manor?

861
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,100
Yes.

862
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,140
No.
