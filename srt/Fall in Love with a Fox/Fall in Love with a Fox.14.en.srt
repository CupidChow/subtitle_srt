[EP14]

3
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,259
What's going on here?

4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,420
The saussurea does cure

5
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,539
the Majesty's meridians.

6
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,539
Then why is our Majesty

7
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,300
still in pain?

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,420
This must be the trick of

9
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,500
the one who hurt the Majesty.

10
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,100
He knew that

11
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,620
although the Majesty can be cured

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,660
after taking the saussurea,

13
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,460
it would be more painful

14
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,780
and he can't do any Kung fu anymore.

15
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,860
So that's why he seduced us to take

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,700
the saussurea on purpose.

17
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,780
How on earth can we cure him?

18
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,539
Take it easy, Lord Xueyue.

19
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,300
The Majesty has no life danger.

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,620
But if we want to heal him,

21
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,540
the Majesty must not

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,700
use his Kung Fu

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,340
recently.

24
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,260
That is to say,

25
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,620
he wants to restrain my action.

26
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,900
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,300
I will catch him

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,180
as soon as possible.

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,380
I will not let him escape.

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,900
Doctor Demon

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,220
You can leave.

32
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,579
Yes.

33
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,740
What's wrong with Chu?

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,700
It's my fault.

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,460
It was all my plan.

36
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,180
You have already known that

37
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,900
escort Jin Baiwan

38
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,180
is Chu.

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,460
Why don't you report that to me?

40
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,100
It was in an emergency.

41
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,580
She said she lost her memory.

42
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,660
I couldn't confirm that.

43
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,380
That's why I...

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,420
What?

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,540
So I was intended

46
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,100
to kill that betrayer

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,540
to let your Majesty has no worries behind.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,660
Idiot.

49
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,700
How can you decide such a big thing

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,540
by yourself?

51
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,860
It's all my fault.

52
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,500
As the Envoy Xueyue of Nonuple Palace,

53
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,620
you should know the consequence

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,500
of unauthorized action.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,980
Zijing

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Zijing understands.

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,500
About Chu,

58
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,660
I'll save your life first.

59
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,860
But about the following mission,

60
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,380
you must make sure nothing will go wrong.

61
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,060
Zijing understands.

62
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,780
I heard that

63
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,660
it was Qingyun who raised the issue

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,140
to bring Chu back.

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,940
Yes.

66
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,780
Where is he now?

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,740
Let him come to me immediately.

68
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,380
This...

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,579
Tell me now!

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,060
The Young Host of Palace hasn't been back yet.

71
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,300
Baiwan

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,060
It's quite early in the morning.

73
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,100
What are you thinking?

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,820
Nothing.

75
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,420
So today what things

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,380
on your wanting list

77
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,100
will you do?

78
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,340
I've thought about it.

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,580
It's silly to fall in love

80
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,620
the way others do.

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,500
Actually as long as I am with you,

82
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,340
anything can make me happy.

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

84
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,540
Lord

85
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,900
The Young Host of Nonuple Palace

86
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,300
has brought many martial arts people

87
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,300
outside.

88
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,540
The Young Host of Nonuple Palace.

89
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,740
Qi

90
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,220
He must be coming for me.

91
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,260
I can talk to him.

92
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,140
No.

93
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,500
We know nothing about the outside situation now.

94
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,540
You can't go out.

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,340
But you haven't recovered yet.

96
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,260
Baiwan, trust me.

97
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,580
Wait for me.

98
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,580
Let's go.

99
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,260
Today, I am here on behalf of

100
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,420
the Nonuple Palace.

101
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,700
Let Qu Zheng hand over

102
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,100
the disciple of my palace, Chu.

103
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,060
Chu?

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,420
But in our Tingqin Garden,

105
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,659
it seems that there's no such person.

106
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,540
Still pretending?

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,540
Chu is

108
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,700
Jin Baiwan of Jin's Escort Agency.

109
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,820
We are here this time,

110
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,180
not only on behalf of the Alliance of Martial Arts

111
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,460
to help the Nonuple Palace,

112
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,460
but also want to

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,220
ask the Lord for an explanation.

114
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,780
Explanation?

115
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,060
What explanation?

116
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,860
Of course it's why he knocked

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,659
all of us down at the

118
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,140
wedding night in Taoyuan Valley.

119
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,540
Yes, that's right!

120
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,540
Explanation! Explanation!

121
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,180
That's right!

122
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,780
Explanation!

123
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,140
Is that rumor true

124
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,580
that Qu Zheng replaced

125
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,340
the Puyuan Canon in secret?

126
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,860
So that's why he robbed the escort,

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,300
Chu.

128
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,460
The Young Host of Palace is right.

129
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,500
Things must be like this.

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,700
Nonsense.

131
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,220
Lord Qu isn't

132
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,060
a person like this.

133
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,460
Su Zhuozhuo?

134
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,900
Is this the Miss of Yan School?

135
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,820
Now that you know who am I.

136
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,380
You must know

137
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,340
I am also

138
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,140
the escort of Puyuan Canon.

139
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,140
I knew that in Taoyuan Valley,

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,260
you were up to no good

141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,300
to call the martial arts people together.

142
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,700
I, Su Zhuozhuo,

143
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,060
can swear as Yan School for Lord Qu

144
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,140
that he never replace the sacred book.

145
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,980
But Qu Zheng robbed Chu.

146
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,380
Everyone has seen that.

147
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
About this,

148
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,540
Miss Su, how can you explain?

149
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,860
Me and Miss Baiwan

150
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,340
have already had an engagement.

151
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,780
I just brought my wife back.

152
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,140
What's wrong with that?

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,940
You always said that

154
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,140
my wife

155
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,780
is your Nonuple Palace's

156
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
disciple.

157
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,740
Where's your proof?

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,260
At that night,

159
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,700
we have already seen

160
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,700
the mark on Jin Baiwan's hand.

161
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,580
That is the proof!

162
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,300
You must be the second hand

163
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,260
of Hong Shao Party.

164
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,140
Yes, what's wrong?

165
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,180
Three years ago,

166
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,100
a family servant of mine was missing.

167
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,900
And on his right arm,

168
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,860
there was a green totem.

169
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,260
According to what you said,

170
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,460
are you

171
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,540
my family servant?

172
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,340
No way.

173
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,540
He can't be his family servant.

174
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,540
You.

175
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,940
Talking nonsense!

176
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,700
So Lord Qu, you mean that

177
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,580
you want to own my disciple compulsorily.

178
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,300
No.

179
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,860
I can't afford that.

180
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,180
Then let's have a fight.

181
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,380
Protect Miss Su.

182
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,540
Every disciple, listen up!

183
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,380
Put on the array.

184
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
My wife is still waiting for me.

185
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Forgive me, I'll leave first.

186
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,140
Kill! Go!

187
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,500
Young Host of Palace, what's this array?

188
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,060
This is the illusion array.

189
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,260
Hold your breath!

190
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,740
Baiwan

191
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,220
Why is it you?

192
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,260
Not welcome?

193
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,740
Don't worry my lady.

194
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,860
Miss Su is here for help this time.

195
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,980
Help?

196
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:44,780
Exactly.

197
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,380
Thanks to Miss Su's

198
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,340
help this time.

199
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,620
I am so grateful for that.

200
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,100
Someone made so much noise

201
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,300
in Taoyuan Valley.

202
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,820
Half of the martial arts circle

203
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
are now coming for you.

204
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,700
I, Su Zhuozhuo, have affection and faith.

205
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,460
Look.

206
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,780
I provide timely help.

207
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,860
So all those people outside

208
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,220
are here for that thing happened

209
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,540
in Taoyuan Valley that night?

210
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,420
Was that because of me...

211
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,420
Baiwan, don't worry.

212
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,740
This is none of your business.

213
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,100
Yes, don't worry.

214
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,060
There's a special array

215
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,380
of Tingqin Garden made by me.

216
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,660
Nobody can break in.

217
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,900
Lord Qu

218
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,780
I have to say something to you first.

219
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,180
Yes.

220
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Let's go.

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Stop. Who are you?

222
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,940
Please forgive me.

223
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,700
I am just a little servant.

224
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,380
I'm not bad guy.

225
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,420
Servant?

226
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,580
Why do you come to Tingqin Garden?

227
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,060
Lord Qu of Tingqin Garden

228
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,420
is my life saver.

229
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,340
I... I am here

230
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,540
to pay a debt of gratitude.

231
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,700
Pay a debt of gratitude.

232
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,540
It's true.

233
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,620
This is the consequence that you still

234
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,100
do this when you are not recovered.

235
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,500
Miss Su, you come from so far away.

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,620
You not only explained for me

237
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,660
in front of everyone,

238
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,180
but also diagnose the illness for me.

239
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,620
I will never forget this kindness.

240
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,780
Don't do that.

241
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,180
You are my patient.

242
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,740
If you have anything wrong,

243
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,340
you are ruining my label.

244
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,940
However,

245
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,500
is this worthwhile

246
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,220
to offend all the martial arts

247
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,540
just because of Jin Baiwan?

248
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,660
Only for her,

249
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,540
It's all worth it.

250
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,820
Enter the room as soon as she came.

251
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,740
What exactly are they talking?

252
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,300
Hello, Lady.

253
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,820
Hello.

254
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,780
Stand there.

255
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,980
Jin Baiwan

256
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,180
I, Su Zhuozhuo,

257
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,740
always can take it or leave it.

258
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,900
I said I don't like, then just be it.

259
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,100
I was talking business

260
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,140
with Lord Qu just know.

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
Don't worry.

262
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,100
I also heard from outside.

263
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,540
Thanks to you.

264
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,420
Please forgive me

265
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,300
for what happened before.

266
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,500
Anyway, I am taking

267
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,820
Lord Qu's gratitude,

268
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,260
not for you.

269
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,300
What?

270
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,900
Don't you want to

271
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,860
know about your miss?

272
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,340
Miss.

273
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,980
What happened to my miss?

274
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,340
She divorced with Lord of Valley Junior.

275
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,100
Divorce?

276
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,300
Is it not shameful enough to write novels?

277
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,180
How dare she leave a note and go?

278
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,220
What an unfortunate family!

279
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,540
Mother

280
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,140
It's all my fault.

281
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,940
Did she really leave

282
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,140
the divorce agreement and go?

283
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,460
Father, she...

284
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,420
She is just a little childish.

285
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
As for that divorce agreement,

286
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,180
it's only a few words.

287
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,260
It can't be taken seriously.

288
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,220
You are still defending her.

289
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
Please don't be angry.

290
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,580
After all, she is my wife.

291
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,300
Now you still treat her

292
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,220
as your wife.

293
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,860
So how can we deal with this thing?

294
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,940
I will take her back to the valley
as soon as possible

295
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,540
and blame her according to

296
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,540
our valley's law.

297
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,260
You.

298
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,180
Lady.

299
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,660
Darling.

300
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:23,940
You.

301
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,900
You. You.

302
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,100
Never mind.

303
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,900
This is not a small thing.

304
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,820
Just now

305
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,060
you promised in front of me and your mother.

306
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,140
Then deal with it

307
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,260
properly.

308
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,820
Thanks, dad.

309
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
Lord of Valley Junior, news.

310
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,220
Young Mrs

311
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,500
has gone back to Jin's Escort Agency.

312
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,620
What?

313
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,820
Why don't you tell this

314
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,780
to my parents?

315
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,540
This...

316
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,180
I personally think that

317
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,060
we'd better not let Lord of Valley and Mrs

318
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,340
know the information of the young Mrs.

319
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,220
Did she do

320
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,140
anything wrong again?

321
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,420
No. No, No.

322
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,100
She immediately wrote her novels

323
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,060
at the time she went back home.

324
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,340
The main point is...

325
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,860
In this novel,

326
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,220
She wrote a villain

327
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,340
with you to be the prototype.

328
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,060
What?

329
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,620
But I heard that

330
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,260
this novel sells well.

331
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,980
I've read it.

332
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,100
The content is so good.

333
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,340
I heard that they're reprinting it everywhere.

334
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,740
Even the price of paper has raised up.

335
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,860
This is nonsense.

336
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,100
Prepare the horse.
Let's go to the Jin's Escort Agency.

337
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,540
Yes.

338
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,340
Miss likes Mr Yu so much.

339
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,500
Why suddenly divorced?

340
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,260
Something must happened.

341
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,420
I have to go back and check her.

342
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,900
No.

343
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,860
You know that

344
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
people outside

345
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,580
are still waiting.

346
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,500
You can't go out now.

347
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,460
So what about my miss?

348
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,820
If you

349
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,540
really want to see Miss Jin,

350
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,540
there can be a way.

351
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,260
You have ideas?

352
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,500
Trust me.

353
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
Head Escort, again.

354
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,620
Those booksellers again?

355
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,260
Yes.

356
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,780
They said

357
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,140
that novel Barefaced Yu Lingfeng

358
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,340
Miss wrote after she came back

359
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,460
sells so good.

360
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,540
So

361
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,580
they are hurried to

362
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,900
make appointments with Miss.

363
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,620
Nonsense.

364
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,540
I can forgive the divorce.

365
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,900
Now she dares to

366
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,300
openly oppose against Taoyuan Valley.

367
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,980
How am I supposed to do

368
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,940
to Brother Yu?

369
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
It's only a few days since she's back,

370
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,580
Miss has already

371
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,740
written a novel.

372
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,940
She has also improved the writing.

373
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,580
Miss.

374
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,660
You haven't eaten anything

375
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,500
for three days and nights.

376
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,580
Your body can't take it.

377
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,460
Miss Muqiu, open the door, please!

378
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,500
What's the matter?

379
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,060
Head Escort, Miss Muqiu...

380
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,660
Yes, sir.

381
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,820
Qiuer, open the door.

382
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,060
It's Dad.

383
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,180
Qiuer, open the door.

384
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,940
It's Dad.

385
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,860
Qiuer, did you hear me?

386
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,580
Dad is gonna kick the door

387
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,140
if you don't open it.

388
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,620
I am gonna kick the door.

389
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,540
Dad really kick the door.

390
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,260
I kick...

391
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,940
Dad.

392
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,780
Pouting again.

393
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,700
What do you think you're doing?

394
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,660
I just want to write the novels.

395
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,820
In Taoyuan Valley, they didn't let me write.

396
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,340
And now you're not gonna allow it as well?

397
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,820
Dad.

398
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,860
I... I didn't.

399
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,540
You tell dad the truth.

400
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,220
What happened to you

401
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,780
in the Taoyuan Valley.

402
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,820
Why do you want to get a divorce?

403
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,820
I don't want to talk about it.

404
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,820
Just talk to dad.

405
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,580
Tell me.

406
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,780
I wrote it all in the novel.

407
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,060
You can read it when I'm done.

408
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,340
Write and write. Always write.

409
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
Do you know how much

410
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,340
influence this novel has now?

411
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,820
All the people...

412
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,180
All the people are waiting

413
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,460
to see Yu Linfeng's jokes.

414
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,300
It serves him right.

415
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,580
What are you talking?

416
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,580
-And...
-Head Escort.

417
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,460
Mr Yu from Taoyuan Valley is here.

418
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,140
What?

419
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,580
Father-in-law.

420
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,620
That's the way it is.

421
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,780
I burned Qiuer's novels.

422
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,900
So your came here to...

423
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,980
I'm here to take Qiuer back to...

424
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,820
I'm not going back with you.

425
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,540
The marriage of these two families is not a game,

426
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,780
which can be you left a paper

427
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,740
and go away?

428
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Yeah, that's not a game.

429
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,820
What more do you want?

430
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,500
Right.

431
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
What more do you want?

432
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,140
Father-in-law.

433
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,380
I came here this time

434
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,540
to sincerely take Qiuer

435
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,500
back to Taoyuan Valley.

436
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,900
This is good.

437
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,980
I think you should go back with him.

438
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,340
I'm not going back with you.

439
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,980
I go back and wait for you to burn my novels again?

440
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,620
Right.

441
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,380
You can't burn them again.

442
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,380
Of course not.

443
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,940
Wait. Who are you?

444
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,339
I'm Miss Jin's bookseller.

445
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,700
Barefaced Yu Lingfeng.

446
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,819
is selling so well.

447
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,579
Miss Jin,

448
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,140
You should renew my contract.

449
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,579
Qiuer, you did this,

450
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,780
what should I do?

451
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,780
What we value most at Taoyuan Valley

452
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,740
is family honor.

453
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,099
Why did you do that?

454
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,619
I'll write it if you won't let me.

455
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,819
Sign the contract, right?

456
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,859
Yes, yes.

457
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
Yu Lingfeng's novel,

458
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,980
I will write it for ten years.

459
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,220
Miss Muqiu.

460
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,580
Miss Muqiu.

461
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,980
Why are you locking

462
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,220
yourself in the room again?

463
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,580
You haven't eaten anything

464
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,980
for several days.

465
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,340
Mr Yu.

466
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,180
Give me.

467
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,540
Qiuer.

468
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,060
The body, hair and skin are from parents.

469
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,500
You can't ruin your health

470
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,660
just because you're angry.

471
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,300
Mr Yu needn't meddle in my affairs.

472
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,540
Why do you have to be angry

473
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,900
regardless of the consequences?

474
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,980
OK.

475
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,540
I promise you

476
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,540
as long as you come back to Taoyuan Valley with me

477
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,620
and apologize to parents,

478
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,900
I, as your husband,

479
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,820
will naturally help you

480
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,740
bear all this.

481
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,980
Qiuer.

482
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,060
I apologize to parents?

483
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,380
So, until now,

484
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,340
you don't think you and your mother

485
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,900
did anything wrong

486
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,500
in burning my novels, right?

487
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,940
I admit that

488
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
my mother's burning the novels

489
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,860
was a bit aggressive.

490
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,540
But she did this

491
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,620
for your benefit.

492
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,740
She wants you

493
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,260
to become a real leader of family.

494
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,820
As for your novels,

495
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,980
they are vulgar anyway.

496
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,580
How can the novels

497
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,660
be vulgar?

498
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Everybody loves it.

499
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
Qiuer.

500
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,820
You and I are married.

501
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,420
You are a member of our Taoyuan Valley.

502
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,740
Your style,

503
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,180
of course, can't be as unruly

504
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,300
as you used to be.

505
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,860
And...

506
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,620
So you don't have to

507
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,740
be here today.

508
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,100
I don't want to stay

509
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,540
in Taoyuan Valley any longer.

510
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,300
I told you that I wanted to divorce,

511
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,580
I meant it.

512
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,820
Is it true what you said?

513
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,140
From now on,

514
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,660
you and I are done.

515
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,780
Just leave.

516
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,300
No matter how angry you are,

517
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,220
you can't starve yourself any more.

518
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,220
How sad Qiuer is

519
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,940
to say these words.

520
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,540
As a husband,

521
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,340
as Taoyuan Valley,

522
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,420
is there really no room

523
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,100
for a novel of Qiuer?

524
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,540
No.

525
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,260
Qiuer and I can't end in this way.

526
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,700
What are you still doing here...

527
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,620
Why is it you?

528
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,700
Qiuer.

529
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,060
Qiuer.

530
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,380
Qiuer.

531
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,500
Father-in-law, Qiuer is missing.

532
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,540
What?

533
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,820
Qiuer is missing?

534
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,420
You're all crap.

535
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,220
Rush in now.

536
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,540
Young Host of Palace.

537
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,860
It is not that we are not effective,

538
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,260
but the fog and the mechanism

539
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,860
are really unbreakable.

540
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,180
What are you doing here?

541
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,260
Qingyun, come back with me.

542
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,620
Our senior sister, Chu,

543
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,060
is now trapped in this Tingqin Garden.

544
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,420
How could I, as the Young Host of Palace,

545
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,420
sit idly by?

546
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,980
Nonuple Token is here.

547
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,500
Seeing Nonuple Token equals seeing Host in person.

548
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,540
Envoy Heiyun, Qingyun listen.

549
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,300
Leave immediately,

550
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,380
and return to Nonuple Palace to meet Host.

551
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,460
Madam.

552
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,700
Look who's here.

553
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,060
Baiwan.

554
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,060
Miss Muqiu.

555
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,540
Miss Muqiu, I missed you so much.

556
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,540
How did you get here?

557
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,700
It's him.

558
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,340
Not me.

559
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,300
It was the Lord's order.

560
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,420
It's none of my business.

561
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,660
How did you get here?

562
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,940
I missed you so much.

563
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,460
I missed you so much, too.

564
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,540
So!

565
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,380
We must divorce.

566
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,340
That's right.

567
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,620
But, Miss Muqiu.

568
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,100
Didn't you always

569
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,380
like Mr. Yu before?

570
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,100
It's all a facade.

571
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,980
From the moment

572
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,660
he burned my script,

573
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,820
I had completely

574
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,260
given up on him.

575
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,380
Good.

576
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,500
When I leave Tingqin Garden,

577
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,700
I'll get even with him.

578
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,780
However,

579
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,740
You're a

580
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,100
public enemy now.

581
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,500
How are you going to get to Taoyuan Valley?

582
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,780
Public enemy?

583
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,300
You don't know about this yet?

584
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,540
Now the whole world is saying that

585
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,100
either Lord Qu changed Puyuan Canon

586
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,500
and held you hostage,

587
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,380
or the two of you conspired together.

588
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
So you are hiding in Tingqin Garden

589
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,180
and afraid to go out.

590
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,220
What?

591
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,220
No.

592
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,220
I can't let Zheng

593
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,500
be misunderstood by all the people of Wu Lin

594
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,140
because of me.

595
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,060
Go get them.

596
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,540
Sit down.

597
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,700
You can't go out yet.

598
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,580
Why?

599
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,580
Nonuple Palace people are

600
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,780
everywhere outside now.

601
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,060
They say you're,

602
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,060
what, the former Envoy Xueyue.

603
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,380
Who knows

604
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,380
what will happen

605
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,460
if you go outside.

606
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,540
We can't do anything unceremoniously right now.

607
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,940
What should I do?

608
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,940
Right.

609
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,420
I can't put Zheng to any more trouble.

610
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,820
Anyway, I don't believe

611
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,060
you're the Envoy Xueyue.

612
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,460
What do you think?

613
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,620
I don't know.

614
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,780
If only you could

615
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,540
get your memory back.

616
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,380
Wouldn't that tell you

617
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
if the people at Nonuple Palace

618
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,860
are telling the truth or not?

619
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,500
Get memory back.

620
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,660
Yes.

621
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,300
Just get my memory back.

622
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,420
But,

623
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,540
Didn't the doctor at Escort Agency say that

624
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,300
no one but a highly-skilled doctor

625
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
can cure your

626
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,780
memory loss?

627
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,500
Isn't highly-skilled doctor right here?

628
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,980
She?

629
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,540
Hello, Doctor Su.

630
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,540
Can I help you?

631
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,820
We do have a little thing

632
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,420
which needs your help.

633
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,300
You want me to restore her memory,

634
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,300
right?

635
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,180
No way.

636
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,540
Doctor Su.

637
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,180
Please,

638
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,100
We can talk about this,

639
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,820
-right?
-Don't drag me.

640
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,820
This thing...

641
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,140
-I'm busy.
-Doctor Su.

642
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,100
-Doctor Su.
-I don't care.

643
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,700
Getting memory back?

644
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,380
Miss Muqiu said that

645
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,740
once I get my memory back,

646
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,100
I'll know if those people of Nonuple Palace

647
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,580
are telling the truth or not.

648
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,900
If what they said is false,

649
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,420
expose them immediately.

650
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,500
But if it's true...

651
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,900
What they said is not true.

652
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,500
I mean,

653
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
it's a big deal.

654
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,340
Baiwan needs to think carefully.

655
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,580
Zheng.

656
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,100
You don't want my memory back?

657
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,100
I just want you to be safe.

658
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,860
Of course, I want to find myself back.

659
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Don't you want to know

660
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,340
what I used to be like,

661
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,740
Zheng?

662
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,180
I knew

663
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,780
Zheng would help me,

664
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,540
right?

665
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,500
So,

666
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,900
What does Su Zhuozhuo like?

667
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,820
So Baiwan

668
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,620
is trying to please Miss Su.

669
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,420
Once she's happy,

670
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,540
she'll be able to help me

671
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,500
get my memory back.

672
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,900
You spent the most time with her,

673
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
so you must know what she likes, right?

674
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,180
These are

675
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,940
all Miss Su's favorites.

676
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,660
All right, I'll be right back.

677
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,820
She said she'd put on weight

678
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,820
and don't want to eat them.

679
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,540
She also said that I laughed at her.

680
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,460
So...

681
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,380
How about this?

682
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,900
Are you sure she likes rabbits?

683
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,140
Hear with my own ears.

684
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,780
OK.

685
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,340
It's gonna work this time.

686
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,740
How do you know so much

687
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,980
about her preferences?

688
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,860
For my wife, naturally.

689
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,060
You can make use of it today.

690
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,100
Let's go.

691
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,260
My God.

692
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,540
What are you coming back so soon?

693
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,820
My God.

694
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,380
She does like rabbits,

695
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,740
but what she likes is spicy diced rabbit,

696
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,100
and braised rabbit head.

697
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,460
She would have eaten the rabbit

698
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,540
if I hadn't told the housekeeper

699
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,980
to hide it quickly.

700
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,780
In that case,

701
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,540
there is really nothing I can do.

702
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,980
No,

703
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,460
I can't just give up so easily.

704
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,100
If we can't cater to her pleasure,

705
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,980
then I'll lure her in.

706
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,980
Lure her in?

707
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,260
At this point,

708
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,060
Miss Muqiu should take the field.

709
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,140
Baiwan.

710
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,580
Are you sure this is gonna work?

711
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,940
I am.

712
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,460
I don't believe

713
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
anyone can escape

714
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
from the charm of novels.

715
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,060
Go, go.

716
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,540
What is it?

717
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,100
That works?

718
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,500
It's over?

719
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,500
Where is the second half?

720
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,620
Baiwan, it works.

721
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,460
I told you that

722
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,580
no one can get away with this.

723
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,900
Where is the second half?

724
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,060
If Miss Su

725
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,220
wants to find the second half,

726
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,580
look...

727
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,580
here.

728
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,420
Our Qiu...

729
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,460
Qiu Qiuer herself.

730
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,140
Qiu Qiuer?

731
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,220
You are Qiu Qiuer?

732
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,340
Did you write this?

733
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,980
Absolutely true.

734
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
If Doctor Su likes it,

735
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,300
I wouldn't mind

736
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,380
writing it now.

737
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,900
I can also read it out loud.

738
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,820
Great.

739
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,060
However...

740
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,220
You are trying to blackmail me

741
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,620
into treating her with this novel, right?

742
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,420
It's impossible!

743
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,540
If Miss Su had not

744
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,460
read the second half,

745
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,620
would you have eaten well

746
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,260
and slept well at night?

747
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,140
Just treating you for a disease.

748
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,060
Sure.

749
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,620
But,

750
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,900
I want to read the second half right away.

751
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,740
It's a deal.

752
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,540
You got a lot of

753
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,660
old wounds on you.

754
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,220
And you have had multiple internal injuries.

755
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,100
You would have been killed

756
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,460
if you didn't have

757
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,060
strong resistance.

758
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
Can Baiwan really

759
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,300
be the first

760
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,060
disciple of Nonuple Palace?

761
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,780
Don't worry.

762
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,780
It's a piece of cake

763
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,820
to cure them.

764
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,900
But

765
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,300
there will be some suffering along the way.

766
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,060
Have you made up your mind?

767
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,340
-How are you?
-Have you remembered anything?

768
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,580
It seems that I've seen some images,

769
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,780
but I don't think I got a good look.

770
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,980
How is that possible?

771
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,340
What did you see?

772
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,900
I saw people killing people.

773
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,540
killing?

774
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,300
But,

775
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,300
If you were

776
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,180
the First Disciple of Nonuple Palace,

777
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,420
you must

778
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,540
have seen it as well.

779
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,780
Those who were killed must be bad people.

780
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,260
Why can't I think of more?

781
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,380
It's impossible.

782
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,220
I've never missed.

783
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,700
You really didn't remember?

784
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,180
How about a few more needles?

785
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,420
You think it's like kidding?

786
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,900
Another stab would kill her.

787
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,900
Since needles don't work,

788
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
use drugs.

789
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,540
Zhuozhuo,

790
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,060
when will

791
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,980
Baiwan recover?

792
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,420
I, Yan School highly-Skilled doctor,

793
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,740
Su Zhuozhuo, am standing here.

794
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,540
Just rest assured.

795
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,340
Surely medicine can cure the disease.

796
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,140
Wait. I'll go get ready.

797
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,660
Does it work?

798
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,180
Just believe her.

799
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,540
Su Zhuozhuo has agreed

800
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,820
to treat Miss Jin's memory loss.

801
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,780
But if she remembers...

802
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,180
She won't remember.

803
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,900
Why?

804
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,500
Because she has no memory loss.

805
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,180
It's that her memory has been sealed.

806
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,260
Sealed?

807
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,180
There's only one Envoy Xueyue

808
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,420
in our Nonuple Palace all the time.

809
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,340
Each has a red moon mark

810
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,780
like this on the wrist.

811
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,740
It seals not only the memory

812
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,700
but also the martial arts.

813
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,900
It's exactly the same as mine.

814
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,100
So you're saying that the mark

815
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,180
actually represents

816
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,060
a kind of seal.

817
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,740
When I was young,

818
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,180
I studied guqin and traveled with an expert.

819
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,660
I've seen a poison

820
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,180
called Wangyou Poison.

821
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,100
When the poison strikes,

822
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
all past memories

823
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,460
are sealed.

824
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,740
Only a rare treasure

825
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,540
called Lingyao Herb

826
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,820
can break the seal.

827
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,860
So,

828
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,540
you're saying that Jing Yuan was afraid

829
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,300
that his Envoy Xueyue would betray him,

830
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,980
so he used the impressions

831
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,780
to deceive them.

832
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,700
Actually,

833
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,540
it's in order to

834
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,460
seal their memories.

835
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,340
Five years ago,

836
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,820
she told me that she thought

837
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,820
what master told them to do

838
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,980
was for the sake of martial arts justice.

839
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,620
She had no idea that

840
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,700
Jing Yuan had been deceiving her.

841
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,380
I can't let her recall

842
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,380
her miserable past.

843
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,700
I'm not gonna let her

844
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,100
go through that pain again.
