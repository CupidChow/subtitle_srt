(Fall in Love with a Fox)
(EP03)

2
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,780
I have nothing but the waist pendant

3
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,979
to repay Mr. Qu

4
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,940
for your great kindness.

5
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,940
Though

6
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,700
it is worthless

7
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,900
I always keep it with me.

8
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,979
If you don't mind,

9
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,740
I'll give it to you.

10
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,380
These days

11
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,580
you've been acting stealthily.

12
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,820
What are you busy doing?

13
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,060
From now on,

14
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,260
I don't need to be stealthy.

15
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,380
Here you are.

16
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,820
For me?

17
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,940
You always say

18
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,140
I'm a cunning fox.

19
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,780
From now on,

20
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,740
whatever you want to do to me,

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,980
this little fox

22
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,940
will bear for me.

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,740
Miss, are you really

24
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,380
giving me

25
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,660
such a personal object?

26
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,980
What if it is related to

27
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,660
your origins?

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,700
It's precious,

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,500
so it expresses my gratitude.

30
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,980
Since you've kept it for so long,

31
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,780
I guess it was given

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,860
by someone important to you.

33
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,980
If it were me,

34
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,579
I would not like you

35
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,860
to give it to someone else.

36
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,940
But you saved me several times.

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,740
If I

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,740
were the person,

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,140
I would only hope

40
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,300
you could keep it well.

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,740
Tonight,

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,900
let's rest here.

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,180
I'll go get you some water.

44
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,100
No, no need.

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,300
You just got rid of the snake venom.

46
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,140
I'll go.

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,820
I'm all good.

48
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,140
Then I'll make a fire and cook.

49
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,940
Where is my lighter?

50
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,620
A token of Yan School?

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,579
The Su family of Yan School has practiced medicine for generations.

52
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,420
No wonder she has such excellent medical skills.

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,180
But why

54
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,380
does she keep it a secret?

55
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,300
Mr. Qu, she makes you work again!

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,540
Mr. Qu

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,740
I mean,

58
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,300
she,

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,019
she got you bitten by a snake.

60
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,540
How can't I be mad!

61
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,060
Mr. Qu

62
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Isn't he her cousin?

63
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,260
I know

64
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,540
our top priority

65
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,140
is to keep an eye on Jin Baiwan.

66
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,900
If she

67
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,980
runs away with sacred book,

68
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,620
anything we do will be in vain.

69
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,380
But I don't understand.

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,140
Why don't we

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,740
just grab it from her?

72
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,420
Why bother?

73
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,300
I

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,540
know what to do.

75
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,300
Miss Jin

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,380
My lighter went missing.

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,820
Did you see it?

78
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,340
There is no chance to run away now.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,020
I need to wait.

80
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,900
Miss Su

81
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,340
Miss Su

82
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,140
Miss Su

83
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,260
Where is Miss Jin?

84
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,620
In the restroom.

85
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,340
That's not possible.

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,980
Her baggage is still here.

87
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,500
Mr. Qu

88
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,380
Jin Baiwan

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,900
is such a trouble-maker.

90
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,380
I've searched everywhere.

91
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,420
I couldn't even find any trace of her.

92
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,300
Is there any possibility that she was taken away by someone?

93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,140
No.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,380
She left herself.

95
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,900
Let's look for her separately.

96
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,100
I'll meet you in the next town.

97
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,420
But I'm a girl, too.

98
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,540
Why don't you worry about me getting lost?

99
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,860
Jin Baiwan

100
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,540
The tricks in my miss's book

101
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,620
work well.

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,260
I even took them as my friends.

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,380
So unexpected.

104
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,940
They also came for sacred book.

105
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
No one is here?

106
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,100
Hello?

107
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,740
I wanna check in!

108
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,580
They can't be asleep so early.

109
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,220
Young master

110
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,180
We've lost whereabouts of her

111
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,780
since we chased after her.

112
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,740
Now everyone

113
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,940
is hunting down that girl.

114
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,460
Madame

115
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,700
I want some good wine

116
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,500
and nice dishes!

117
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll get you

118
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,380
some quilts.

119
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,580
Wait!

120
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,460
You look familiar.

121
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,860
Mr. Yu

122
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,980
What a coincidence!

123
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,220
Yeah!

124
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,020
Why not

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,060
have some wine with us?

126
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,580
Young master

127
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,820
Have a toast!

128
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
Both sacred book,

129
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,100
and the chick

130
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,300
have come into our trap!

131
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
This is returning the things to its original owner!

132
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,060
That means the Puyuan Canon

133
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,780
and the girl

134
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,020
both belong to you!

135
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,020
No.

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,820
The book is mine.

137
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,860
That chick is

138
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,380
too ugly.

139
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,020
I'm too good for her!

140
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,900
Right!

141
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,500
You're the ugly one!

142
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,140
The ugliest one!

143
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,820
Come on! Raise your cups!

144
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,940
Bro, let's toast!

145
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,780
Come on!

146
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,860
How dare you!

147
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,700
I didn't buy my tittle of

148
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,900
the No.1 handsome man.

149
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,260
Stop it!

150
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,340
Sacred book!

151
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,860
I won't let you escape.

152
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,860
Let her go.

153
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,340
Fine.

154
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,860
Give me the book

155
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,780
and I'll let her go.

156
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,300
I can give it back to you.

157
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,860
He is trading the book for me!

158
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,140
You can't give him the book!

159
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,940
Just go!

160
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,700
Why did you give it to him!

161
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,300
Let's go.

162
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,740
Don't let her go!

163
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,420
How despicable you are!

164
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,700
You've got the sacred book but you still don't let us go.

165
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,660
If I let you go,

166
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,380
my reputation will be ruined

167
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
completely by you two.

168
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,380
Take them down!

169
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,220
Watch out!

170
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,060
Qu Zheng is as cunning

171
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,780
as a fox.

172
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,180
Why did I suffer the cutting for him?

173
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,220
So

174
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,540
you do know martial arts.

175
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,660
Seven days ago,

176
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,580
someone used pigeons to send a message to all schools.

177
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,740
It said the Jin's Escort Agency

178
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,100
is delivering the Puyuan Canon

179
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,100
this time.

180
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,700
Five years ago, the entire Xu family was murdered

181
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,100
due to the Puyuan Canon.

182
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,780
Five years after that

183
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,980
the book of magical martial arts

184
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,980
has reappeared

185
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,540
and caused a sensation.

186
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,620
There must be

187
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,540
something weird.

188
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,660
I agree.

189
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,620
Host Jing Yuan has a point.

190
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,380
When I received the message from the pigeon,

191
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I just sent my daughter Zhuozhuo,

192
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,860
following Qu Zheng, the Tingqin Lord of the Tingqin Garden

193
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,660
to look into this matter together.

194
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,180
I'm sure soon we'll get the results.

195
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,700
Five years ago, the Xu family were murdered.

196
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,860
We recommended pupils of the Nonuple Palace

197
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,900
to make a survey.

198
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,620
Now that five years ago

199
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,940
we didn't find the murderer,

200
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,140
nowadays,

201
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,940
we should still

202
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
send pupils of the Nonuple Palace for surveys.

203
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,740
That should be appropriate.

204
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,860
Fine.

205
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,700
Business is business.

206
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,260
People from the Nonuple Palace

207
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,300
are known for justice and fairness.

208
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,060
I, representing the Taoyuan Vally, agree

209
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,100
to let Host Jing Yuan

210
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,540
continue to investigate this case.

211
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,580
With your trust,

212
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,460
our Nonuple Palace

213
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,820
will fulfill our responsibility.

214
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,860
Rubbish!

215
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,660
Get up!

216
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,620
Envoy Xueyue

217
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,140
Help us, envoy Xueyue!

218
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,140
Well,

219
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,540
our young host...

220
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,060
Get away, all of you.

221
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,740
Envoy Xueyue, you just came back.

222
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,580
Now you're giving orders in my place?

223
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,220
You let go of my subordinates.

224
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,140
Do you want to practice with me?

225
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,220
It's been five years.

226
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,460
You always do that on this day every year.

227
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,220
Just because today is her deathday.

228
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,180
Shut up!

229
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,740
She's not dead.

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,140
One day,

231
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,580
I will find her.

232
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,660
You're just lying to yourself.

233
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,540
You are the young host of the Nonuple Palace.

234
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,420
And you should share the burden with your father!

235
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,780
It's my business.

236
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,500
None of your business.

237
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,140
You always know

238
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,780
I never meant to be your rival.

239
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,460
Enough!

240
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,300
I don't care

241
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
what you think.

242
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Why don't you ask me

243
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,300
the same question?

244
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,100
If it were me,

245
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,780
I would not keep her alive

246
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,500
in the world!

247
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,540
You don't remember anything, do you?

248
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,940
But you still tried to protect me.

249
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,900
When can you

250
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,940
remember me?

251
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,020
Yifei

252
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,380
Yifei

253
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,380
Where is my sacred book?

254
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,980
How do you feel now?

255
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,500
Who treated my wound for me?

256
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,460
You almost lost your life,

257
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,700
so I put aside the rules and did it for you.

258
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,060
But I promise

259
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
I didn't take any advantage of you.

260
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,620
I'm still a girl.

261
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm not married!

262
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,620
How could you...

263
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,340
If you do want me

264
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,220
to take full responsibility,

265
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
then I have to

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,580
agree.

267
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,180
You are reluctant,

268
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,500
aren't you?

269
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,660
Take care, your wound.

270
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,540
I have a question for you.

271
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,740
You deliberately keep your skills of martial arts from me.

272
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,100
But you have followed me all the way.

273
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,140
You have planned everything.

274
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,980
All you did is for sacred book,

275
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,020
right?

276
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,980
I want you to tell me.

277
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,460
Who on earth are you?

278
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,020
I did keep something

279
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,060
from you.

280
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,940
But I'm a good guy.

281
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,580
My family name is Qu,

282
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,900
and first name, Zheng.

283
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,100
Qu Zheng

284
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,340
Madame may have mentioned that name.

285
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,020
Three years ago,

286
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,060
Qu Zheng, the champion of the battle of martial arts by the lake,

287
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,460
founded the Tingqin Garden.

288
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,380
So are you

289
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,860
the Tingqin Lord?

290
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,820
Right.

291
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,380
But why didn't you tell me?

292
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,140
Miss, do you know,

293
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,540
the sacred book you're holding

294
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,340
is nothing

295
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,500
but the Puyuan Canon

296
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,780
that got lost five years ago.

297
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,260
Puyuan Canon?

298
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,900
Five years ago,

299
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,620
the entire Xu family was murdered.

300
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,580
And the Puyuan Canon was lost.

301
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,620
Now, five years has passed,

302
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,260
the book reappeared

303
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,660
and caused a sensation in the world.

304
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,820
What I need to do

305
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,740
is to figure out

306
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,740
what's behind the book.

307
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,500
But I've never thought

308
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,300
it would

309
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,780
get you involved

310
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,140
and make you badly wounded.

311
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,859
So you didn't come to grab the book?

312
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,140
Now can you rest assured?

313
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,099
That means, along the way,

314
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,900
it was not me protecting you,

315
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,220
but you always

316
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,500
protected me secretly.

317
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,619
In Yu Chen's house.

318
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,780
In the lantern show.

319
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,460
Right?

320
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,780
You're not wrong.

321
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,260
But if I had told you my identity,

322
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,180
you would've been better.

323
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,460
That's right.

324
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,859
I got troubles

325
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,020
all because of you.

326
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,620
Yes, it's all my fault.

327
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,860
Then,

328
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,100
I would not disturb you.

329
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,500
My room is next to yours.

330
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,460
If you need anything,

331
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,580
just call me.

332
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,020
Goodbye.

333
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,980
I, I...

334
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,380
Is she all right?

335
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,300
The cut wasn't too deep.

336
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,380
Or

337
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,140
I'll never

338
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,820
forgive myself.

339
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,420
Are you sure it's she?

340
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,380
Sure.

341
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,700
To draw out your enemies,

342
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,500
you asked someone to deliver the Puyuan Canon.

343
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,020
But because of her,

344
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,060
you changed your plan again and again.

345
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,260
Are you sure

346
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,740
she's the one you're looking for?

347
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,420
Who's there?

348
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,100
Mr. Qu

349
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,020
Mr. Qu

350
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,460
Take care of your wound.

351
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,820
There's a rat in the room.

352
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,700
Little do I know

353
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,860
how you're afraid of

354
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,260
a little rat?

355
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,460
I just want to

356
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,860
ask you

357
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,820
is it a safe inn?

358
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,180
Relax.

359
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,500
I have checked here.

360
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,980
And you can have your rest.

361
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,700
Well

362
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,500
will Yu Chen come after me again?

363
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,060
I have punished him.

364
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,060
I think,

365
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,100
he would not get himself into any troubles.

366
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,460
But, what if

367
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,180
those book-thieves

368
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,100
come to rob the book

369
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,700
when I am asleep?

370
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,300
I tie this red string between our hands.

371
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,380
I'll guard you outside your room.

372
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,260
So I can protect the book,

373
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,380
and

374
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,220
protect you well

375
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,500
Is it too tight?

376
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,340
That's it?

377
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,420
Have a try.

378
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,780
Miss Jin

379
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,180
Now do you feel secure?

380
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,500
It's all for protection.

381
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,700
Protection for the Puyuan Canon!

382
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,780
Have a nice dream.

383
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,180
You got me.

384
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
I'll play the zither for you outside

385
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,060
to help you sleep better.

386
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,500
Mr. Qu

387
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,020
Miss, what can I do for you?

388
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
To be honest,

389
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,300
without you,

390
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,820
I'm afraid I'd be dead already.

391
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,540
I owe you a "thank you".

392
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,900
You don't have to.

393
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,460
But,

394
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,500
you've lied to me so many times.

395
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,620
I'll keep that in mind.

396
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,980
Even a swordsman has two faces.

397
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,900
That's different from what's in the scripts.

398
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,180
Totally different.

399
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,700
It's always hard to tell true from false.

400
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,740
Not as liberal as

401
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,820
what people think.

402
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,780
So why do swordsmen like you

403
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,820
travel everywhere?

404
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,380
For settling down all the injustice.

405
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,900
For

406
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,580
finding my Miss Right.

407
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,260
You've told me

408
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,220
you were looking for someone.

409
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,340
Are you looking for

410
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,940
a girl?

411
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,060
Yes.

412
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,980
Then,

413
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,460
is she pretty?

414
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,660
In my mind,

415
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,380
she is just and honest,

416
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,460
kind and lovely.

417
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,900
She is tens of thousands of times

418
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,940
better than any other girl in the world.

419
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,660
Is she

420
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,820
good at martial arts?

421
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,700
She's better than most people.

422
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,340
She's good at martial arts and she looks pretty.

423
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,500
Then she may not be good at cooking.

424
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,900
I don't care about other people.

425
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,580
But every meal she cooked,

426
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,580
I enjoyed so much.

427
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,500
There can't be a perfect girl like her.

428
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,900
You're lying again.

429
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,460
Then, Miss Jin,

430
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,380
if one day,

431
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,540
I find the girl

432
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,340
that I keep looking for,

433
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,140
what do you think I should do?

434
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,140
How would I know

435
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,380
your thoughts?

436
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,260
But I know

437
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,340
what I need to do.

438
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,620
The Majesty,

439
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,300
I've heard that

440
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,620
all schools agreed to

441
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,620
let us, Nonuple Palace,

442
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,100
to investigate the Puyuan Canon.

443
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,820
So I offer to finish the job.

444
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,900
I have assigned it

445
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,140
to Envoy Xueyue.

446
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,420
You just need to mind your own business.

447
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,620
I'm sure to

448
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
finish the job properly.

449
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,140
Please take me into consideration.

450
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,460
I have made a decision.

451
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,180
You don't need to mention it anymore.

452
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,540
But through these years,

453
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,500
you've been training

454
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,500
the Heisha troops.

455
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,340
And the troops are

456
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,340
commanded by Envoy Xueyue.

457
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,340
I also want to

458
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,420
do something for the Nonuple Palace.

459
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,180
You,

460
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,860
as the young host of Nonuple Palace,

461
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,260
should always remember that

462
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,540
Nonuple Palace

463
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,300
respects strength.

464
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,260
If you have any complaint,

465
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,500
show your strength

466
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,580
and strive for what you want.

467
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,100
You can't just come here,

468
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,940
begging me for an opportunity.

469
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,660
I understand.

470
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,940
I'll go.

471
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,300
During your healing,

472
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,540
if you need anything,

473
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,900
just tell me.

474
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,740
I'll try my best to do that.

475
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,860
By the way...

476
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,820
What's more?

477
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,860
I get you a highly-skilled doctor.

478
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,140
Tell from the time,

479
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,100
she should be here now.

480
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,100
Mr. Qu

481
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,340
Mr. Qu

482
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,580
How was your wound?

483
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,700
You again?

484
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,420
You again?

485
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,860
You made me and Mr. Qu separated.

486
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,140
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

487
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,140
And now you're asking me

488
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,980
to treat your wounds?

489
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,660
You? Highly-skilled doctor?

490
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,740
Our Yan School has practiced medicine for generations.

491
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,660
Except for my dad,

492
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,780
only I, Su Zhuozhuo, can be regarded as

493
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,220
a highly-skilled doctor.

494
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,620
Miss Su

495
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,340
Miss Jin got seriously wounded

496
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,380
because of me.

497
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,460
And I hope you can give her treatment.

498
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
You two lied to me,

499
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,180
saying that you were cousins.

500
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,620
We lied to you. So what?

501
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,860
You are so silly!

502
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,140
You even slipped away!

503
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Now you stew in your own juice.

504
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,220
You two were acting stealthily!

505
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,980
How could you blame me!

506
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,060
Miss Jin, don't be mad.

507
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,620
Miss Su is frank and outspoken.

508
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,980
But she's a kind and professional doctor.

509
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,460
She would not leave you wounded.

510
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,140
Right?

511
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,860
You want me to give her treatment.

512
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,340
Fine.

513
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,180
But I have one request.

514
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,540
What's your request?

515
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,860
Give me the Puyuan Canon!

516
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,660
What?

517
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,100
What are you talking about!

518
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,460
We'll talk about it later.

519
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,660
Mr. Qu

520
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,020
Our purpose

521
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,980
is to investigate

522
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,060
the Puyuan Canon.

523
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,780
If she keeps the book,

524
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,220
she will surely lose her life.

525
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,340
Why don't you

526
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,140
give the book to us.

527
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,260
All in all,

528
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,140
you just want the book.

529
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,100
You are nothing different

530
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,060
from Yu Chen!

531
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,900
Jin Baiwan

532
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,740
You'd better follow my order while I am being nice.

533
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
If I meant to grab your book,

534
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,460
-I would have... -Miss Su

535
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,140
Miss Jin is still healing.

536
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,140
If you insist on

537
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
trading the book for treatment,

538
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,540
I shall call another doctor.

539
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,740
Why are you always partial to her?

540
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,900
Just treatment.

541
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,380
I'll do it.

542
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,940
So many bowls of medicine?

543
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Why so smelly?

544
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
I can't drink them!

545
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,380
The prescription of me, Su Zhuozhuo,

546
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,700
is invaluable!

547
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,300
Are you turning up your nose at it?

548
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,900
Are you playing a trick on me?

549
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,620
Anyway, I'm not feeling hurt.

550
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,540
Drink it or not. It's up to you.

551
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,740
So many medicines.

552
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,020
They must be bitter.

553
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,740
I can't do it.

554
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,980
Good medicines taste bitter.

555
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,460
Miss, you can rest assured.

556
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,420
Preserved plum?

557
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,860
Fine, I'll drink them.

558
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,020
Is it sweet?

559
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,860
Yes, it's sweet.

560
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,380
My shoulders

561
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,100
seem aren't that hurt.

562
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,860
Sweet?

563
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,460
I'll teach you a lesson soon!

564
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,900
Su Zhuozhuo

565
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,980
What do you want to do!

566
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,980
Look at your face.

567
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,660
You should know,

568
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,620
medicines for easing pain

569
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,940
somewhat have side effects.

570
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,700
Don't make a fuss.

571
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,260
You did it on purpose, right?

572
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,500
Yes, on purpose.

573
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,500
So what?

574
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,420
Your Jin family isn't strict with family disciplines,

575
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,540
and they didn't behave the servants.

576
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,740
So I teach you

577
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,900
how to behave well!

578
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,980
Do you dare to bother

579
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,700
Mr. Qu shamelessly

580
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,740
with such an ugly face!

581
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,700
You can curse me.

582
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,820
But how could you curse Jin's Escort Agency!

583
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,900
You do care about

584
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,100
your Jin's Escort Agency.

585
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,620
I just curse your whole family!

586
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,500
You are just as badly-behave as your hosts.

587
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,540
Miss Su

588
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,780
Miss Jin is injured.

589
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,580
I hope you could care for her.

590
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,780
Why you're always on her side?

591
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,460
I did that for you!

592
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,700
Stop!

593
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,380
Miss Jin

594
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,660
Don't be angry.

595
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,980
She could curse me.

596
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,700
But she couldn't curse the Jin's Escort Agency!

597
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,180
It's my fault.

598
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,700
If it were not because of me,

599
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,540
Miss Su

600
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,940
would not be mad at you.

601
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,380
Your fault?

602
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,740
I get it.
