1
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,220
(Fall in Love with a Fox)
(EP01)

2
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,970
(Where there are people,
there is the martial arts world.)

3
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,770
(Our world)

4
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,490
(has different and harmonious sects.)

5
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,930
(Taoyuan Valley has strict rules.)

6
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,289
(Jin's Escort Agency is generous and just.)

7
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,330
(Nonuple Palace is the head
of the martial arts world.)

8
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,250
(Five years ago,)

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,490
(it was said that)

10
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,410
(the one who mastered a book)

11
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,970
(named Puyuan Canon)

12
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,850
(could be the No.1 in this world.)

13
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,610
(The Xu family)

14
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,090
(who has preserved the canon)

15
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,650
(was murdered.)

16
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,090
(Since then, the canon has been disappearing.)

17
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,690
(Five years later,)

18
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,530
(the canon appears again.)

19
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,770
(The story starts with a female cook)

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,130
(from Jin's Escort Agency.)

21
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,290
Jin Baiwan is out.

22
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,450
Come here, everyone.

23
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,130
It's so early.

24
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,570
Yes.

25
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,490
We have to be early

26
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,650
because my bookstore

27
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,130
is crowded with Qiu Qiuer's

28
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,010
readers.

29
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,530
Yeah.

30
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,130
Yes.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,090
Without update,

32
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,410
I can't fall asleep.

33
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,010
You must know

34
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,850
the following stories.

35
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,730
(Our Miss)

36
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,890
(is the most famous)

37
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,850
(novel author recently.)

38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,810
(Her readers urge me every day for updates.)

39
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:00,930
Stop.

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,410
I'm just a cook in the agency.

41
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,010
Don't ask me.

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,210
I don't know, either.

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,050
Although your Miss

44
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,850
writes the novel,

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,930
but you are the only one

46
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,650
who can urge her for updates.

47
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,930
We all know that.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,730
You

49
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,610
are our only hope.

50
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,890
Right.

51
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,290
Tell us more.

52
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,170
Miss

53
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,130
Why are you here?

54
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,890
Miss

55
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,130
Where is she?

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,450
She's gone in a twinkling.

57
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,930
We have to continue to urge her.

58
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,530
Is it going to rain?

59
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,650
I forgot to collect my clothes.

60
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,530
Hurry up.

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,690
Let's go home and collect the clothes.
Wait for me.

62
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,370
Wait for me.

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,130
Hurry up.

64
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,410
My clothes were all wet.

65
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,050
Miss, Miss

66
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,690
I won't.

67
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,970
If you force me to marry Taoyuan Valley,

68
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,690
I'll kill myself.

69
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,650
Miss

70
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,930
Miss

71
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,090
This is my Miss,

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,170
Jin Muqiu.

73
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,370
She's not usually like this.

74
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,890
She's forced to get married,

75
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,170
so she can only...

76
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,850
I'm a writer.

77
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,370
I would rather die.

78
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,330
Baiwan

79
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,810
I don't want to get married.

80
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,650
I'm happy with

81
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,850
writing novels.

82
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,850
Why do I have to marry

83
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,450
a man I haven't ever seen?

84
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,690
But Taoyuan Valley is a notable family

85
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,490
in the martial arts world.

86
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,530
Mr Yu

87
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,890
is the only young master.

88
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,370
That's awful.

89
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,970
In novels,

90
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,370
such person is definitely

91
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,570
foppish

92
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,890
and unfaithful.

93
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,890
If I marry him,

94
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,210
he must stay out all night

95
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,250
with other women,

96
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,490
gamble

97
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,210
and even hit me.

98
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,690
That's too much.

99
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,970
It's far more than that.

100
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,330
He must have a

101
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,409
vicious mother,

102
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,409
who will ask me to

103
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,570
learn needlework late at night,

104
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,930
often hit me

105
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,210
and give me no food.

106
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,730
Before long,

107
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,330
I will

108
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,850
die in his home.

109
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,210
Stop.

110
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,330
Miss

111
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,490
Actually, I have an idea already.

112
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,409
Really?

113
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,530
You've had a long day

114
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,690
from Taoyuan Valley.

115
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,930
Good job.

116
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,690
Mr Jin

117
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,650
I come here for my marriage.

118
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,090
with great sincerity.

119
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,490
But Miss Jin

120
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,850
doesn't want to see me.

121
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,130
She must be dissatisfied

122
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,810
with me.

123
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,730
No, no, no.

124
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,450
How could she... Well...

125
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,490
Of course, no.

126
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,130
Here comes the Miss.

127
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:22,970
She is here.

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,330
What are you doing?

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,450
He's handsome.

130
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,290
Right.

131
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:47,850
No.

132
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,850
Didn't you just say he would

133
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,970
gamble and hit you?

134
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,170
No.

135
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,330
Handsome guys don't hit their wives.

136
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,090
You know nothing.

137
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,130
You will know

138
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,690
when you meet your Mr Right.

139
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,330
Jin Muqiu

140
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,170
What's

141
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,450
wrong with your face?

142
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,530
It doesn't matter.

143
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,850
Miss Jin

144
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,650
is willing to see me

145
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,650
with such a face.

146
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,730
She's so sincere.

147
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,370
But we people from Taoyuan Valley

148
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,610
never force others.

149
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,490
So I want to formally ask

150
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,570
if Miss Jin

151
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,850
wants to

152
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,930
marry me?

153
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,050
Yes, I do.

154
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,770
She said yes

155
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,650
so quickly.

156
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,290
Five years ago,

157
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,890
she saved me who lost all the memory.

158
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,010
She's my saviour.

159
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,930
But I can't buy a proper dowry

160
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,050
for her.

161
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:37,850
No.

162
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,050
Mind your step.

163
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,210
No.

164
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,170
Mr Jin

165
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,890
It's just a canon.

166
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,610
Please help me.

167
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,210
No.

168
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,570
My daughter will marry to

169
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,370
Taoyuan Valley.

170
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,650
We're all

171
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,770
busy.

172
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,970
We have no time to deliver this canon.

173
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,610
You...

174
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,250
I can do

175
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:53,970
the escort job.

176
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,970
(In these five years,)

177
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,210
(I have never)

178
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,290
(left the Escort Agency.)

179
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,850
(But in order to buy a dowry for her,)

180
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,890
(I'm willing to do it.)

181
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,170
(I thought it was)

182
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,290
(an ordinary Buddhist scripture.)

183
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,290
(But I didn't expect)

184
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,170
(I'll be caught into an adventure)

185
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,650
(of love and hate)

186
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,730
(and with flashes and shadows of swords.)

187
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm coming,

188
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,049
the martial arts world.

189
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,290
Sugar-coated haws.

190
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,570
Good.

191
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,170
Miss

192
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,530
Do you want a sugar-coated haw?

193
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,610
No.

194
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,690
Sugar-coated haws.

195
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,930
Sugar-coated haws.

196
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,850
Good.

197
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,210
Bravo.

198
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,090
Bravo.

199
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,210
So this is the martial arts world.

200
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,490
There's no difference.

201
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,890
Bravo.

202
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,570
Mr Qu

203
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,370
Mr Qu

204
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,490
Mr Qu is playing the guqin.

205
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,450
Let's go. Hurry up.

206
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,570
Mr Qu

207
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,530
Is he famous?

208
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,050
Look at him.

209
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,530
Mr Qu is so handsome.

210
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,570
Yes, look at him.

211
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,770
He has such a handsome face

212
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,530
and is skillful in playing the instrument.

213
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,850
That's too much.

214
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,290
He's so handsome.

215
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,290
Excuse me.

216
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,530
He's

217
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,450
a hero

218
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,410
from Qiu Qiuer's novel.

219
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,530
Exactly.

220
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,690
Is he

221
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,210
smiling at me?

222
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,250
Miss?

223
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,170
He's smiling at me.

224
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,010
Miss, you block our view.

225
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,730
Sorry, sorry.

226
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,890
I'll sit here.

227
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,970
He's smiling at me.

228
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,130
She has the canon.

229
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,850
We have to rob it.

230
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,490
She's just a girl.

231
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,850
After getting the canon,

232
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,490
we can have fun with her.

233
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,770
What's wrong with you?

234
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,370
Who did that?

235
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,890
Come out.

236
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,890
I'll kill you.

237
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,530
What are you looking at?

238
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,010
Get away from here.

239
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,170
What are you looking at?

240
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,770
They're listening to my music silently.

241
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,730
Why are you so noisy?

242
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,010
You're so rude.

243
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,410
You are just a performer in the street.

244
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,770
Leave me alone.

245
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,890
I'll smash your instrument.

246
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,010
Stop.

247
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,610
You're rude at first.

248
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,250
How dare you hit him?

249
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,970
Bro

250
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,450
I...

251
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,090
We should be careful.

252
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,650
Let's go.

253
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,690
Thank you for upholding justice.

254
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,250
You are welcome.

255
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,090
We can help out

256
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,850
when going out.

257
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,170
It's my duty.

258
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,330
I'm Qu Jinyu.

259
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,530
You are?

260
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,850
I'm Jin Baiwan

261
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,090
from Jin's Escort Agency.

262
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,250
The title is not important.

263
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,530
Help me.

264
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,730
Are you hurt?

265
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,050
Am I that heavy?

266
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,330
Don't you know any martial arts?

267
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,850
Why don't you dodge?

268
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,570
Sorry to make myself a joke.

269
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,250
If I know martial arts,

270
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,290
I was not afraid of

271
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,370
those bad guys.

272
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,850
Let me help you stand up.

273
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,850
My leg.

274
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,330
They wanted to hit you.

275
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,770
Why were you so calm?

276
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,330
If I didn't

277
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,850
pretend to be calm,

278
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,930
I would be

279
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,010
in a more dangerous situation.

280
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,370
Good for you.

281
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,690
Miss Jin

282
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:15,930
Have we met

283
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,970
before?

284
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,730
(It's so old-fashion.)

285
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,250
I think you must mistake me for someone else.

286
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,370
We haven't met before.

287
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,010
Then, do you need to

288
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,370
see a doctor?

289
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,490
No.

290
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,690
I have my own business.

291
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,890
I'll go.

292
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,970
Mr Qu

293
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,210
Maybe we'll meet

294
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,210
again someday.

295
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,610
Miss Jin

296
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,650
Miss

297
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,770
You lost your wallet.

298
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,970
What are you doing?

299
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,290
Do you want to rob my bag?

300
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,210
I won't give you the chance.

301
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,930
Miss

302
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,770
I'm a cripple.

303
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,090
I'm so hungry.

304
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,130
Can you give me some food?

305
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:20,770
Sneak!

306
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,210
You should have some new tricks.

307
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,130
I saw them in the novels.

308
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,890
Listen,

309
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,250
can you practice more?

310
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,810
Master

311
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,770
What should we do now?

312
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,330
Don't be in a hurry.

313
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,530
We'll get it sooner or later.

314
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,170
Okay.

315
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,810
Sachet.

316
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,170
Excuse me, give me a bowl of noodles.

317
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,730
Alright.

318
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,290
Please.

319
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,810
Here you are.

320
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,450
Delicious beef noodles.

321
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,850
Enjoy.

322
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,290
Wait.

323
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,010
It's not poisonous.

324
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,810
I just want to try.

325
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,970
Kiddo

326
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,730
What's wrong with you? Why are you crying?

327
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,090
It's him again.

328
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,050
It's so coincident.

329
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,370
Sis, this is our ball.

330
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,530
You're so beautiful.

331
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,170
Can you play with us?

332
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,570
Sorry, I can't.

333
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,650
I have to eat my noodles.

334
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,890
Go, be good.

335
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,250
Go ahead.

336
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,370
Go with me.

337
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,130
Stop.

338
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,610
He's stealing your wallet.

339
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,330
Let's go.

340
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,890
My noodles!

341
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,890
Miss Jin

342
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,730
Thank you for reminding me.

343
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,170
But

344
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,770
I destroyed your noodles.

345
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,650
Waiter

346
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,730
Give me another bowl of noodles.

347
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,490
Okay.

348
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,690
There is no need.

349
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,490
Mr Qu

350
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,410
You should be careful

351
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,050
when going out.

352
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,930
I didn't expect

353
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,930
I would be cheated by a kid.

354
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,410
You're easily

355
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,170
to be cheated

356
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,330
by others.

357
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,050
Do you think I'm stupid?

358
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,490
Here are your noodles.

359
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,570
I'll get it.

360
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,090
Okay.

361
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,090
Here, Miss.

362
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,250
Thank you for helping me twice.

363
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,290
Otherwise, I may be

364
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,930
caught into some troubles.

365
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:58,810
So

366
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,250
can you do me another favor?

367
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,810
What's that?

368
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,570
I want you to be

369
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,290
my guard.

370
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,609
Look.

371
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,609
Once you are with me,

372
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,770
those bad guys

373
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,810
will be afraid of you.

374
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,050
You're skillful

375
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,170
and brave,

376
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,130
right?

377
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,010
What should we do now?

378
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,250
Whatever, let's just do it.

379
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,569
Miss Jin, watch out.

380
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,410
Let's go.

381
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,609
Stop.

382
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,170
Stop.

383
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,010
Stop running.

384
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,690
Stop.

385
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,450
Stop.

386
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:43,890
Get out of my way.

387
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,210
Thank you, Miss Jin.

388
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,170
You have saved me

389
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,570
twice.

390
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,450
Don't mention it.

391
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,090
This is no time for this.

392
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,970
Let's run first.

393
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,730
Come here.

394
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,010
She's there.

395
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:54,890
Go.

396
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,450
Miss

397
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,570
Do you need any help?

398
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,370
Yes.

399
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,570
Did you remember

400
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,930
what I told you?

401
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,610
Yes.

402
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,850
Once Jin Baiwan is out,

403
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,570
we'll

404
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,890
circle her.

405
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,490
Yes.

406
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,370
And then you save her.

407
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,650
Jin Baiwan

408
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,690
will fall in love with you.

409
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,250
It's a pity that

410
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,450
I need to sacrifice myself

411
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,050
for Puyuan Canon.

412
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,130
Mr Yu, she is coming.

413
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:30,570
Get ready.

414
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,090
Okay.

415
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:34,930
Miss

416
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,770
Excuse me.

417
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,570
Step aside.

418
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,170
Mr Yu

419
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,530
How dare you rob the canon from me?

420
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,210
You're not getting away with it.

421
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,690
Come on, get plan B ready.

422
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,170
Okay.

423
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,930
This way.

424
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,970
They're so

425
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,690
bad-tempered.

426
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,530
I just expose their lies.

427
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,930
Why did they try to kill us?

428
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,810
No.

429
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,050
If it was really because of

430
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,170
what we did,

431
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,210
there won't be so many people.

432
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,770
Are they

433
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,810
trying to

434
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,810
rob my canon?

435
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,410
Or

436
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,130
him?

437
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,810
Miss Jin

438
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,530
We have just met,

439
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,770
but became friends of life and death.

440
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,490
Who is your friend?

441
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,530
If it were not for you,

442
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,050
they won't follow me.

443
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,010
Me?

444
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,730
Yes.

445
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,250
Every time I'm with you,

446
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,290
I'm in trouble.

447
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,250
Do you believe it?

448
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,050
We go in different ways

449
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,170
and see who will get into trouble.

450
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,850
What is this?

451
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,410
Wait.

452
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,610
Be quite.

453
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,130
He's dead.

454
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,410
She killed our master.

455
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,610
Master?

456
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,890
You have to pay for it.

457
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,290
Take her back and punish her.

458
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,370
Wait.

459
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,410
I'm the one

460
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,970
who was close to the man.

461
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:10,970
Why do you think that

462
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,770
Miss Jin did this?

463
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,010
Then, take you two back.

464
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,210
You haven't figured out anything.

465
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,130
Why do you take us back?

466
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,130
Cut the crap.

467
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,330
Why do you rob my bag?

468
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,450
Let it go.

469
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:20,930
You...

470
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,450
Give it back.

471
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,530
No.

472
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,490
He's not dead. He is a liar.

473
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,290
Shut up.

474
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,010
Take them away.

475
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,290
It turns out that he knows martial arts.

476
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,530
He can surely protect me in the future.

477
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,410
Who is there?

478
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,770
Me.

479
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,810
Miss Jin

480
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,890
Mr Yu

481
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,050
Miss Jin's erythema

482
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:39,970
has been recovered.

483
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,130
That's so good.

484
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,650
Thank you for caring for me.

485
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,170
I saw you

486
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,890
practice swordplay in the morning.

487
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,010
You worked hard.

488
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,090
So

489
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,090
I bring you a cup of tea.

490
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,010
Thank you.

491
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,250
But I can't drink it now.

492
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,010
Jueming

493
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,770
Why?

494
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,850
Taoyuan Valley has rules.

495
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,890
We can't drink and eat anything

496
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,610
before finishing practicing

497
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,090
the Yu Swordsmanship three times.

498
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,010
Young master

499
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,930
has practiced

500
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,730
twice.

501
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,330
It's okay.

502
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,610
It's not Taoyuan Valley here.

503
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,410
I'll keep it secret.

504
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,330
Don't worry.

505
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,850
I do the right thing without being asked.

506
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,090
Rules

507
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,170
are my restraint.

508
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,090
Because of

509
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,170
no supervision,

510
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,250
I

511
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,450
need to obey the rules more strictly.

512
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,410
Miss Jin

513
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,410
Thank you for bringing me the tea.

514
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,490
Mr Yu

515
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,330
You're a real gentleman.

516
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,890
I want to ask you another question.

517
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,130
Please.

518
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,690
That day my face

519
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,010
was awful.

520
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,010
Why didn't you regret

521
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,010
our marriage?

522
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,290
It's about our families.

523
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,050
I won't regret

524
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,130
unless you don't want to marry me.

525
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,490
Of course, I wouldn't say no.

526
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,250
Qiuer

527
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,330
Qiuer

528
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,170
Dad

529
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,890
Mr Jin

530
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,490
Something happened.

531
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,250
Baiwan may be caught into trouble.

532
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,490
What?

533
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,850
I got a message.

534
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,770
A few days ago,

535
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,810
all sects have received a message

536
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,490
that the canon in Baiwan's hand

537
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,450
is Puyuan Canon
which has disappeared for a long time.

538
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,850
Now

539
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,410
all sects are trying to rob it.

540
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,770
Puyuan Canon?

541
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,410
Yes.

542
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,050
It has disappeared

543
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,810
for a long time

544
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,290
since the Xu family was murdered.

545
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,450
It's weird.

546
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,890
Maybe at the very beginning,

547
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,850
they are coming after

548
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,210
Jin's Escort Agency.

549
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,450
So now we should

550
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,850
find Baiwan right now.

551
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,490
Wait.

552
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,810
It happens

553
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,930
when we're preparing for our marriage.

554
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,850
It's not random.

555
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,730
Now we should

556
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,730
go back to Taoyuan Valley

557
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,610
as soon as possible.

558
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,130
What about Baiwan?

559
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,810
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

560
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,490
The affairs of Jin's Escort Agency

561
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,010
are Taoyuan Valley's business.

562
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,010
I'll send people

563
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,810
to find Baiwan.

564
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,770
If there is any news,

565
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,730
I'll tell you.

566
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,690
Miss Jin

567
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,570
Why are you standing behind me?

568
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,330
I want to tell you

569
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,730
don't worry.

570
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,770
Worry?

571
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,210
Their master is not dead at all.

572
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,850
This is a trap.

573
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,930
Trap?

574
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,930
You're smart, young master.

575
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,610
With no effort,

576
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,890
we got the canon

577
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,530
from Jin Baiwan.

578
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,890
I'm surely smart

579
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,450
and handsome.

580
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,850
Yes.

581
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,690
The canon

582
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,210
is not that simple.

583
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,410
Not simple?

584
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,370
You shouldn't have helped me.

585
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,170
Otherwise,

586
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,090
you won't be in here.

587
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,530
You saved me twice.

588
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,650
Now you're in trouble,

589
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,650
I'm sure to

590
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,450
save you.

591
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,450
I didn't expect that you're so

592
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,890
responsible.

593
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,850
I misunderstood you.

594
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,010
About what?

595
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,290
I thought

596
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,530
you only

597
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,650
have a handsome face.

598
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,250
I didn't expect...

599
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,130
I didn't mean it.

600
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,570
You thought

601
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,530
I'm handsome.

602
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,690
But you said

603
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,090
I'm stupid.

604
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,690
How could he

605
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,050
have such a good memory?

606
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,570
We get the canon

607
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,690
in the name of Mole Gang.

608
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,890
If Jin's Escort Agency

609
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,290
wants to figure it out,

610
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,410
the Yu family will not be

611
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,650
found.

612
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,850
Now I have

613
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,890
this unique canon,

614
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,090
the Yu family

615
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,810
will be No.1 in the martial arts world.

616
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,010
I'll be afraid of nothing.

617
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,810
Right.

618
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,490
But, how do we open it?

619
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,730
You need to open it, right?

620
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,250
I heard the stuff of Jin's Escort Agency

621
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,330
is enclosed

622
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,010
in a wooden box.

623
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,490
Apart from you,

624
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,290
no one knows how to open it.

625
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,490
Right.

626
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,930
I have a method

627
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,490
which can not only help you

628
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,250
get the canon back,

629
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,530
but also help us escape from here.

630
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,090
But...

631
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,170
But what? Tell me.

632
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,690
No way.

633
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,570
This method

634
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,970
will make you sacrifice too much.

635
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,530
As long as I can get the canon back
and get out of here,

636
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,850
I can do everything.

637
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,770
Even if it is to get married?

638
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,610
Are you willing to do that?

639
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,530
With

640
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,210
the master of Mole Gang?

641
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,450
Saw it?

642
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,610
Yes, right here.

643
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,650
It's none of my business if I break it.

644
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,730
No way.

645
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,970
Then I don't want to saw it.

646
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:04,930
I...

647
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,170
Hurry up.

648
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,210
Help, help us.

649
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,170
Someone is dying.

650
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,850
We need a doctor.

651
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,370
Nine over ten people here

652
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,610
used this method.

653
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,850
Don't waste your energy.

654
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,610
We can't cheat them.

655
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,850
What can we do?

656
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,610
If the wooden box is opened forcibly,

657
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,610
the gunpowder in it will explode.

658
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,650
Then the canon will be nothing.

659
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,410
At that time,

660
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,530
they won't forgive us.

661
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,170
It's my fault.

662
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,810
I got you into this trouble.

663
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,730
Now, at the moment of life and death

664
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:34,770
I can only

665
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,490
tell you

666
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,570
my feeling toward you.

667
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,050
Although we just met

668
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,970
with you,

669
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,970
I can't help falling in love with you

670
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,170
when I saw you.

671
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,050
If you really

672
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,970
are the person

673
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,450
I'm looking for,

674
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,250
from now on,

675
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,530
whether we are alive or dead,

676
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,090
whatever trouble we're in,

677
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,930
I

678
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,530
will not let you go.

679
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,250
We're acting, right?

680
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,050
You look so real.

681
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,570
The first time

682
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,010
I saw you...

683
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,650
Keep a close eye on them.

684
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,930
Heaven is our witness.

685
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,050
Today,

686
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,610
I'll marry Miss Baiwan.

687
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,490
I swear

688
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,570
you're the only love

689
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,490
in my whole life.

690
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,690
I'll be faithful

691
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,890
and won't leave you.

692
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,330
The moon

693
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,690
is my witness.

694
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,050
I'm willing to

695
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,450
marry Chu.

696
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,330
Be faithful to you

697
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,690
forever.

698
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,970
I'll never betray you.

699
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,290
My love is like the moon.

700
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,930
I'll be with you

701
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,290
forever.

702
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,810
(Why is the scene)

703
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,530
(so familiar?)

704
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,610
Whatever, I need to save my life first.

705
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,010
(But)

706
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,890
(if I can marry a man)

707
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,530
(as responsible)

708
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,770
(as him,)

709
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,010
(it will be my luck.)

710
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,730
Stop it.

711
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,890
Why are you so noisy?

712
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,930
I overheard

713
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,370
the girl

714
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,450
was marrying the boy

715
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,450
in the jail.

716
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,450
What's the point?

717
00:29:59,490 --> 00:29:59,930
The point is

718
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,450
the wooden box

719
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,490
of Jin's Escort Agency is well designed.

720
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,490
It can't be opened

721
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,410
brutally.

722
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,290
If you open it this way,

723
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,090
the box and the canon will explode.

724
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,730
She may not tell the truth.

725
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,890
If she cheated us,

726
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,450
what should we do?

727
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,970
She said

728
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,290
only she can open it.

729
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,490
But she's unwilling

730
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,530
to open it for us.

731
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,490
Da*n it.

732
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,690
Do they get married?

733
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,650
Then, I have an idea.

734
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,050
Take the canon.

735
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,090
Go.

736
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,090
Hurry up.

737
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,610
-Let go of me.
-Master.

738
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,010
What is love?

739
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,650
It's about life and death.

740
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,570
Let me ask you a question.

741
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,450
Is there anything more important

742
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,610
than love?

743
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,570
No.

744
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,570
So

745
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,250
compared with your love,

746
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,490
the canon

747
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,850
is nothing.

748
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,850
It's already in your hand.

749
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,170
You just open it yourself.

750
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,530
I knew everything.

751
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,770
Only you can

752
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,050
open it.

753
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,610
Take him here.

754
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,010
If you don't open

755
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,370
the canon,

756
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,330
I'll kill your

757
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,410
husband.

758
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,090
Honey

759
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:30,770
Darling

760
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,050
Don't give the canon

761
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,650
to them.

762
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,450
Think it over.

763
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,330
Okay.

764
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,050
If I'll open it,

765
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,250
you release my husband.

766
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,450
That's it.

767
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,410
Don't come here.

768
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,690
What do you mean?

769
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,730
There is no trap

770
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,690
in the box.

771
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,370
It's made of wood

772
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,490
which is easy to ignite.

773
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,730
If you don't release me

774
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,450
and my husband,

775
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,690
we'll die together.

776
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,730
What can we do?

777
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,210
Follow my orders later.

778
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,210
Okay.

779
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,930
Release them.

780
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,570
Give me my bag.

781
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,610
Here is your bag.

782
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,770
How dare you.

783
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,090
Master

784
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:16,890
You're

785
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,650
so vicious.

786
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:19,810
What's the matter?

787
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,290
I finally find you.

788
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,330
Do you know that?

789
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,970
I have a good relationship
with Jin's Escort Agency.

790
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,050
You want to hurt her?

791
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,850
Did you ask my opinion?

792
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,130
No.

793
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:32,930
Go get them.

794
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,970
Miss, follow me.

795
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:34,610
Go, go, go.

796
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,290
Hurry, let's go.

797
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,410
Don't let them get away.

798
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,410
Go get them.

799
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,370
Go.

800
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,450
Here you are.

801
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,730
Wait, wait.

802
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,610
This is my home. Let's get in.

803
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,090
Okay.

804
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,010
Close the door.

805
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,850
Okay.

806
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,090
What are you doing?

807
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,850
Are you stupid?

808
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,050
They're like

809
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,090
two sitting ducks of our young master.

810
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,290
It's over.

811
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,330
Let's go.

812
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,250
Won't they follow us here?

813
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,770
They can't

814
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,210
get into my house at will.

815
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,850
May I know your name?

816
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,450
I'm Yu Chen.

817
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,570
Thank you for helping us out.

818
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,370
You...

819
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,450
What's wrong with you?

820
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,730
Are you hurt?

821
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,730
It's okay.

822
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,810
Mr Yu is a good person.

823
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,969
He not only helps us,

824
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,610
but also

825
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,210
takes us in.

826
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,330
I swear

827
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,570
you're the only one

828
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,530
in my life.

829
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,330
I'll be faithful

830
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,770
and won't leave you.

831
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:45,489
It's done.

832
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,090
Thank you.

833
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,449
Hey.

834
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,889
We were in an urgent situation

835
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,530
just know.

836
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,650
Don't take it seriously.

837
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,889
I won't too.

838
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,130
That's for sure.

839
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,610
But

840
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,250
do you find your love

841
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,450
since you care about it so much?

842
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:04,810
Me?

843
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,970
Of course, no.

844
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,170
What kind of men

845
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,090
do you like?

846
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,090
That's meaningless for me.

847
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,930
I want to take adventures
in the martial arts world.

848
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,930
I don't take that

849
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,010
into account.

850
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,090
If there is a

851
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,970
handsome,

852
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,490
smart and brave man

853
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,130
who wants to be with you,

854
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,050
will you accept him?
