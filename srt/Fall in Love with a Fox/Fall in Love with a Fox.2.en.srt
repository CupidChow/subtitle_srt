00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,280
(Fall in Love with a Fox)
(EP02)

2
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,729
Now, if there is

3
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,570
a dashing man

4
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,890
who is brave and resourceful

5
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:45,770
wants you to stay,

6
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,610
will you say yes to him, Miss?

7
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,370
Well, no.

8
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,850
Why?

9
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,970
Mr Qu

10
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,370
We've been fought together,

11
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,930
so we're friends, right?

12
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,650
It's my honor

13
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,970
to be Miss Jin's friend.

14
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,290
I mean

15
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,650
we'd better

16
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,930
avoid any confusion as friends.

17
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,010
What are you doing here?

18
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,490
I'm here to deliver a message to you, Miss.

19
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,370
The young master wants to meet both of you.

20
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,090
Right.

21
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,770
Look.

22
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,890
Why did she leave?

23
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,890
We should go, too.

24
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,329
Let's go.

25
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,010
There's something wrong in this house.

26
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,130
Actually, it's...

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:48,770
No.

28
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,450
There's something wrong with Yu Chen.

29
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,210
We just wanted to escape from the Mole Gang

30
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,530
as fast as we can,

31
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,130
and we had no time to think about

32
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,890
the time that Mr. Yu showed up

33
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,450
was so coincident.

34
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,890
You're right.

35
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,210
He knew

36
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,650
I work for Jin's Escort Agency.

37
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,410
Maybe he's...

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,890
coming for the sacred book.

39
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,210
So...

40
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,050
We can't stay here.

41
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,610
I'm afraid it's not easy to leave here.

42
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,010
Don't worry, Miss.

43
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,810
Since you consider me as your friend,

44
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,490
I will protect you

45
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,329
no matter what happens.

46
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,010
You hired me as your escort

47
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,930
before, right?

48
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,930
But why do you want to

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,850
protect me now?

50
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,610
And you know nothing about kong fu.

51
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,570
How can you...

52
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,610
Although I don't know kong fu,

53
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,650
I'll find a way

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,970
to protect you.

55
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,490
Okay.

56
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,810
Leave here?

57
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,650
Yeah.

58
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,329
Thanks for your help this time.

59
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,250
Mr. Yu

60
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,370
It's just that...

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,490
Miss Jin and I

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,530
have something to deal with right now,

63
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,930
so we must leave.

64
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:50,930
No.

65
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,970
How can Miss Jin

66
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,130
want to leave?

67
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,890
I just found something.

68
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,090
What did you find?

69
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,970
I helped you

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,010
in a such cool way.

71
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,330
I'm afraid it already

72
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,170
made a lasting impression

73
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,010
on you.

74
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,450
Don't be shy, Miss.

75
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,650
If you

76
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,650
stay here,

77
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,330
I will keep you safe.

78
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,850
As the young master of Yu's family,

79
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,650
how can you force the people

80
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,810
from Jin's Escort Agency to stay here?

81
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,250
You misunderstood me, Miss.

82
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,649
If you can stay in my house,

83
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,250
I will keep you safe.

84
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,130
As for him...

85
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,930
He can leave now.

86
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,570
Mr. Qu

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,690
Just help yourself.

88
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,530
You misunderstood, Mr. Yu.

89
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,290
Since you

90
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,450
have a crush on Miss Jin,

91
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,530
wanting her to stay here for a few days more,

92
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,490
then I

93
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,690
will comply your request.

94
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,409
What?

95
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,330
No, no, no.

96
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,530
You guys

97
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,690
held a wedding ceremony in Mole Gang.

98
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,970
How can you let her

99
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,970
stay here like that?

100
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,530
How did you know that?

101
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,810
I...

102
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,810
I heard of it.

103
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,290
Don't worry, Mr. Yu.

104
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,370
What Miss Jin and I did

105
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,290
was to fool

106
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,570
the leader of Mole Gang.

107
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,770
Besides,

108
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,570
Miss Jin once said that

109
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,210
we had no other option at that time.

110
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,650
Just let it go.

111
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,010
What're you talking about?

112
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,210
I thought you were my friend.

113
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,170
Good.

114
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,930
I believe Mr. Yu is a magnanimous person,

115
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,650
so you

116
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,850
will let that pass, right?

117
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,650
Me?

118
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,090
Of course, I will let it go.

119
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,530
That's great.

120
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,650
Tomorrow morning,

121
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,050
I will say a proper farewell

122
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,370
to you two.

123
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,530
Young master

124
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,970
Don't you remember

125
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,570
what you said just now?

126
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,690
What did I say?

127
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,010
We had a deal that...

128
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,810
What's the deal?

129
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,370
There is no sacred book in the bag.

130
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,970
Well, tomorrow morning

131
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,170
we will send Mr. Qu off,

132
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,490
so I will leave you to talk.

133
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,370
I have something important to deal with.

134
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,250
Wait! I...

135
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,890
You can't go.

136
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,690
Come here.

137
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,290
You tell me exactly

138
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,250
what you mean?

139
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,490
If Miss Jin keeps

140
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,970
badgering me like this here,

141
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,130
it will be inappropriate.

142
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,450
Badgering you?

143
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,210
I would not have thought that

144
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,450
you were an ingrate and traitor.

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,250
At stake,

146
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,930
I have to

147
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,690
keep myself safe first.

148
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,570
You should only blame yourself

149
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,930
for being so trusting.

150
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:19,810
You...

151
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,890
After all,

152
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,450
it seems that

153
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,770
you lack life experience.

154
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,330
Don't worry, Miss.

155
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,810
Everything's for a reason.

156
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,610
The young master told me

157
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,050
Miss Jin has been bustled about for one day,

158
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,890
so you'd better bathe and dress.

159
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,690
Bathe?

160
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,610
Lord Xueyue, I have news to report.

161
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,130
The escorts took the sacred book

162
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,210
to Yu's house.

163
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,690
It doesn't matter if she dies.

164
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,010
What matters is

165
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
to figure out

166
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,570
if the sacred book is authentic.

167
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,250
Got it.

168
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,690
You must do it quietly and carefully.

169
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,530
If there is anyone that

170
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,930
knows Nonuple Palace

171
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,010
get involved in it,

172
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,770
we're all gonna die.

173
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,930
Got it, my lord.

174
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,330
Miss Jin

175
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,490
We have been tracking

176
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,210
along the escorting route,

177
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,250
so I believe we will

178
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,410
find something about Miss Baiwan soon.

179
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,810
Really?

180
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,930
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

181
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,290
Miss Jin

182
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,090
What're you writing?

183
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,530
Nothing.

184
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,490
I just copy

185
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,370
some books by sages.

186
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,610
That's cool.

187
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,770
Thank you.

188
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,570
Each time I finish my needlework,

189
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,810
I copy some words from books

190
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,050
to self-reflect.

191
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,930
That's great.

192
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,330
As an ancient saying goes,

193
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,650
"Every day I examine myself on three counts."

194
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,690
I admire Miss Jin

195
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,690
for keep doing that every day.

196
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,690
You're the one that I should learn from.

197
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,850
So...

198
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,130
Mr. Yu

199
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,970
You can go on.

200
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,530
I will go to meet my father.

201
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,290
Bye.

202
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,170
Watch out!

203
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,530
Are you alright?

204
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,690
Yeah.

205
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,250
Stop!

206
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,130
What happened?

207
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,690
I can do it myself.

208
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,010
It's okay. Let me help you.

209
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,010
I said no!

210
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,970
Are you okay, Mr. Yu?

211
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,010
I didn't mean it.

212
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,650
Let me bind it up.

213
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,050
I'm okay, Miss Jin.

214
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,970
Well,

215
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,650
I'm going to ask someone else

216
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,290
to pick it up for you.

217
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:15,850
It doesn't matter.

218
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,810
Your scratch is more important.

219
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,210
Well...

220
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,410
Qiuer

221
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,490
What're you looking for?

222
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,690
I'm looking for some medicine for Mr. Yu.

223
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,610
Is he sick?

224
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,650
No.

225
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,169
It's my fault.

226
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,650
I hurt him.

227
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,770
Did you guys get into a fight?

228
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,090
Are you badly hurt?

229
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,450
-No -Let me have a check.

230
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,090
His hands got hurt.

231
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,970
There are bruises on them.

232
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,250
Oh, my daughter,

233
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,730
stop searching it.

234
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,730
That's a precious gift

235
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,010
for your future father-in-law.

236
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,970
Besides,

237
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,090
it won't work for

238
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,410
the bruises on hands.

239
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,330
How about that?

240
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,930
That's the Medication for Wound Infection

241
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,810
passing down from our family.

242
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,970
That is more precious than

243
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,770
Taoyuan Valley's Yulu Pill.

244
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,290
Whatever.

245
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,010
Just let him pick himself.

246
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,050
Qiuer

247
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,090
Qiuer

248
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,850
She hasn't got married with him,

249
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,370
but she has been so nice to him.

250
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,450
Kids all get to grow up one day.

251
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,570
Miss Jin

252
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,530
Is it serious?

253
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,730
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

254
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,970
The wound is so long.

255
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,370
It must be pretty bad.

256
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:28,810
Thank you.

257
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,650
Trust me.

258
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,970
These are superior medications.

259
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,890
I got that from my dad

260
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,650
for you.

261
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,730
What...

262
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:52,890
Young master

263
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,530
Sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:53,890
Sorry.

265
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,850
Sorry.

266
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,650
Miss Jin

267
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,850
Don't trouble yourself.

268
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,650
Well, I'm going to take a new one for you.

269
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,570
Miss...

270
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,930
Young master

271
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,370
Didn't you say that

272
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,810
you don't love her?

273
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,930
Why you're so nice to her?

274
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,210
We can't see our engagement as a child's play.

275
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,970
Somehow,

276
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,530
I have to marry her

277
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,130
for Taoyuan Valley's sake.

278
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,170
You will marry her though you don't love her.

279
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,530
What will you do with it later?

280
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,610
I believe

281
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,530
we can be a good couple

282
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,410
if we treat each other with love and respect.

283
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,170
Miss Jin is coming.

284
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,690
I'm back with the medication.

285
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,050
Miss, please.

286
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,010
Leave me alone.

287
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,250
Why did they follow my instruction?

288
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,450
No.

289
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,050
There must be someone else here.

290
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,570
The reason why Yu Chen asked me to get a bath

291
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,890
is to get

292
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,170
the sacred book.

293
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,970
Don't worry, Miss.

294
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,450
Everything's for a reason.

295
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,090
So does that mean...

296
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,850
he has other ideas.

297
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,410
Why do I think of him now?

298
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,690
The sacred book will be mine.

299
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,250
You're so smart, young master.

300
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,890
Miss Jin

301
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,730
The sacred book has been

302
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,730
thrown out of the wall

303
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,050
as you ordered me.

304
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,770
We can get it back

305
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,010
after escaping

306
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,690
from here tomorrow.

307
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,410
Good job.

308
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,610
No one knows that

309
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,570
we had thrown the book

310
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,530
out of there.

311
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,690
Don't freeze!

312
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,370
Go find it!

313
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,170
They've gone.

314
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,050
Have you found it?

315
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,890
There's nothing, young master.

316
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,770
Master

317
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,010
Jin Baiwan has escaped!

318
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,650
What?

319
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,330
We're fooled! Move it!

320
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,610
Okay, okay.

321
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:31,970
Go!

322
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,730
It's beautiful.

323
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,610
Look at those staffs.

324
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,690
Have a look, sir.

325
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,170
Come in, sir.

326
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,330
This way, this way.

327
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,690
Come on. Come on.

328
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,290
On my god.

329
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,170
This...

330
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:49,930
There!

331
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:50,930
Go!

332
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:52,850
What're you doing?

333
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,050
It's crowded here.

334
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,290
If you rush everywhere,

335
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,490
you'll be easy to spot.

336
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,730
What can we do now?

337
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,290
They're over there.

338
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,610
We can watch the lantern shows

339
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,010
with others.

340
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,530
Watching the lantern shows?

341
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,370
What're you doing?

342
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,810
To cover up.

343
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,250
Sorry for my offence.

344
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,010
What is she doing here?

345
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,130
It's impossible.

346
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,610
Goodbye, sir.

347
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,490
Come again.

348
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,250
A mask?

349
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,610
Taking that,

350
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,050
it will be more difficult for them to find us.

351
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,130
Have we met

352
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,050
somewhere before?

353
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,050
They're over there!

354
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,450
Move!

355
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,770
I don't want to be a burden to you anymore!

356
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,970
Leave!

357
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,810
I have punished the rascals

358
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,050
that offended you, Miss.

359
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,290
I'm Xu Yifei.

360
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,930
It's nice to meet you.

361
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,050
My I know your name, Miss?

362
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,210
Stop!

363
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,850
Freeze!

364
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,010
You wanna run away?

365
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,650
No way!

366
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,930
Yu Chen, the young master of Yu's family,

367
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,330
wants to kidnap a girl here.

368
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,050
Help me!

369
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,050
Shut up!

370
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
You, you little girl

371
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,690
damaged

372
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,690
my reputation.

373
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,090
Why don't you self-reflect?

374
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,010
Why did Qu

375
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,930
abandon you?

376
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,010
Mr. Yu

377
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,250
Although your family is so rich,

378
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,610
but you have venereal disease,

379
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,690
the worst one.

380
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,690
How can I marry you?

381
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,290
I don't have any venereal disease.

382
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,410
I don't have any venereal disease.

383
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,930
I don't have any venereal disease.

384
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,490
I'm so healthy!

385
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,610
You! Move!

386
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,650
Go!

387
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,250
Get her back!

388
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,090
Rise!

389
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:39,810
Go!

390
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,170
Stop!

391
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,490
Here she is! Here she is!

392
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,530
You want the sacred book, right?

393
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,090
Yeah. The sacred book.

394
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,690
I won't give it to you

395
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,490
even though I rip it into pieces.

396
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,490
Pick it up!

397
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,170
Screw you!

398
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:05,849
You two

399
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,569
get her down!

400
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,170
Go!

401
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:07,569
Okay.

402
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,170
Freeze!

403
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:08,930
You! Get down!

404
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,369
You want that, right?

405
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,770
Are you okay?

406
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,530
Let's go.

407
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,930
Where're you going?

408
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,530
I see. You collude with each other.

409
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,250
Little girl

410
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,530
You know it until now?

411
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,170
He's so weak?

412
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,650
Go, go, go.

413
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,490
Come on.

414
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,290
Go.

415
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,410
Stop!

416
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,530
Freeze!

417
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,730
Okay.

418
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,490
Get all the pieces back!

419
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,810
Am I clear?

420
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,610
Yes, sir.

421
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,930
Go have a check there!

422
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,570
How's it going?

423
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,690
These are the pieces of the sacred book.

424
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,570
Okay. Let me have a look.

425
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,610
The Romance of Flower Rain and Swordsman.

426
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,970
A Collector's Edition with Qiu qiuer's Signal.

427
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,650
It may be a fake one.

428
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,850
I know!

429
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,850
You must get her back

430
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,810
for me today!

431
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,210
I must cut her body into pieces!

432
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:53,850
Let's go!

433
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,810
How can she go out with such an ugly face?

434
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,490
Is she ugly?

435
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:12,650
Yeah.

436
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,850
Move!

437
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,330
Lord

438
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,770
The escort ran away anyway.

439
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,490
The Guqin player with her

440
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,730
is not a normal person.

441
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,170
He doesn't matter.

442
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,170
What matters is that you must

443
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,050
find the escort.

444
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,210
But the Majesty told us

445
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,210
to make it clear

446
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,490
whether the sacred book is authentic, right?

447
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,850
Are you questioning my orders?

448
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,810
No. I'm sorry.

449
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,250
Here's what you should know.

450
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,970
You must

451
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,170
find the escort for me

452
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,210
at any cost.

453
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,850
Yes, my lord.

454
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,410
Don't worry, Miss.

455
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,010
We're out of the town for miles.

456
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,650
Finally.

457
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,010
Thank you so much, Mr. Qu.

458
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,490
You saved me one more time.

459
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,370
It's so flattering, Miss.

460
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,010
It's my honor

461
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,610
to go through something with you.

462
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,130
But you don't know kong fu.

463
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,530
Weren't you afraid that you would be in danger

464
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,730
when you came for me?

465
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,050
I can't be a traitor

466
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,210
or an ingrate

467
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,770
whether I know kong fu or not, right?

468
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,690
And I promised you that

469
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,610
I would keep you safe,

470
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,770
so I must keep it.

471
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,210
Come on.

472
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,970
Here we are.

473
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,010
You saved me again this time,

474
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,890
so you're a friend of

475
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,010
Jin's Escort Agency.

476
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,330
I'll protect you in the future.

477
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,250
What're you doing?

478
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,410
She is...

479
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,210
She's my cousin, Su Zhuozhuo.

480
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,930
Thanks to her,

481
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,130
we can escape from there.

482
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,130
Oh, she's your cousin. I see.

483
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,130
I'll treat your cousin

484
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,250
as my cousin.

485
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,370
Who's your cousin?

486
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,330
Although Qu...

487
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,650
my cousin saved you,

488
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,210
don't expect that you can get along with him

489
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,250
in a causal way.

490
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,010
Get off.

491
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,130
You can get off now, my cousin.

492
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,250
Be careful.

493
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,970
She is so wild.

494
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,850
So,

495
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,570
except for Yu Chen,

496
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,570
those crowds of gang members

497
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,770
headed for

498
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,730
the goods escorted by you.

499
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,690
If you insist on

500
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,090
escorting the goods,

501
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,290
the way you go

502
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,810
will be more dangerous.

503
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,210
Jin's Escort Agency never lose the goods.

504
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,650
I must deliver the sacred book to my client

505
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,210
though it is difficult.

506
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,290
So...

507
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,290
Will you deliver it by yourself?

508
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,650
Well...

509
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,770
So where will you go,

510
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,490
Mr. Qu and cousin?

511
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,530
In fact, I'm meant to

512
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,450
find a people this time.

513
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,530
Find a people?

514
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,050
I had received the news that

515
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,330
the person would head to Tongzhou.

516
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,690
Tongzhou?

517
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,370
So we're on the same path!

518
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,330
Really?

519
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,210
Well, then,

520
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,850
how about going there together?

521
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,370
And we can help each other.

522
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:40,970
Okay.

523
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,810
Cousin

524
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,730
Are you sure we have to go there together?

525
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,130
It's inconvenient for Miss Jin

526
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,570
to take us together.

527
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,770
You're right.

528
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,250
We're not in the same world.

529
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,250
If you go there with us,

530
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,490
we'll be a burden to you.

531
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,570
No, no.

532
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,210
The more, the merrier.

533
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,490
It's settled, then.

534
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,250
It's settled, then.

535
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,890
You've been bustled about for the whole night,

536
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,010
so you must be hungry, right?

537
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,650
Let me cook you a meal.

538
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,410
Wow, you can cook.

539
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,690
I'm the best chief of

540
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,890
Jin's Escort Agency.

541
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,570
Have a taste.

542
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,850
It looks not bad.

543
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,810
Of course.

544
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,690
You don't know what the delicious food is.

545
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,770
Well, try it.

546
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,370
Nice.

547
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,170
I knew it.

548
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,610
Mr. Qu must be the one

549
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,890
that can enjoy my meal.

550
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,730
What the meal?

551
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,450
It's too spicy and salty.

552
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,490
Why do you take

553
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,010
so many peppers with you when going out?

554
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,450
How to have a meal

555
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,770
without peppers?

556
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,010
It's said Jinbian Town's people like peppers.

557
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,890
So that's true.

558
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,490
By the way,

559
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,330
I've been meaning to ask,

560
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,970
did you grow up

561
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,810
in Jin's Escort Agency?

562
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,570
Yeah.

563
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,090
I grew up in the agency,

564
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,410
so I began to eat spicy food when I was young.

565
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:31,730
Haven't you ever left

566
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,050
Jin's Escort Agency?

567
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,010
Of course no.

568
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,930
Since you like

569
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,530
my soup so much,

570
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,850
let me take another bowl for you.

571
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,970
No. Stop.

572
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,170
If my cousin get sick because of

573
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:46,770
your soup,

574
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,970
you can't take the responsibility for that.

575
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,930
Cousin

576
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,850
Don't take the soup, please.

577
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,130
Go to sleep early.

578
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,210
We'll have a long way to go tomorrow.

579
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,450
What will you do

580
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,370
if I disappear some day?

581
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,170
I will

582
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,250
find you

583
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,930
wherever you're,

584
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,010
either in the heaven or hell.

585
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,490
Why didn't you show up

586
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,210
after three days?

587
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,770
Who is he?

588
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,250
Why did he keep asking about my background?

589
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,210
Does he really know nothing about kong fu?

590
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,090
The spicy dried meat from Fuyun Restaurant.

591
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,090
Don't you have a try?

592
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,410
You know

593
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,290
I never eat spicy food.

594
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,970
But you took the meal

595
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,770
cooked by Miss Jin,

596
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,850
and you enjoyed it.

597
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,090
How's going on?

598
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,130
Is she the one?

599
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,170
She didn't like peppers before,

600
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,930
so I can't make sure about it now.

601
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,170
How about you?

602
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,450
How's the investigation going?

603
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,290
There were two people with masks

604
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,450
on the lanterns show.

605
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,330
I can't figure out which school they're from.

606
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,930
The leader of them is so powerful.

607
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,170
I nearly got caught

608
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,050
when I stalked them.

609
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,890
So I had to give up.

610
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,050
It doesn't matter.

611
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,450
Since they

612
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,490
headed for the sacred book,

613
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,290
they will show up again.

614
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,050
So...

615
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,770
You have to make up your mind quickly.

616
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,610
I'll try to figure it out

617
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,170
whether she is the one

618
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,290
I want to find.

619
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,850
You've glanced at me for many times

620
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,490
in one hour.

621
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,850
What happened, Miss?

622
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,930
If he knows something about kong fu,

623
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,050
I will know it by his hands.

624
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,490
I just feel

625
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,570
it's boring.

626
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,170
I want to play a game with you.

627
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,970
You can just speak it out.

628
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,450
I want to read your palms.

629
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,370
Read palms?

630
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,970
But I wonder

631
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,290
if you can trust me.

632
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,890
I believe all the words

633
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,570
you speak.

634
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,250
Excuse me.

635
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,730
There are so many calluses on his hands.

636
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,130
How can I know

637
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,730
if he practices kong fu?

638
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,730
Have you got something, Miss?

639
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,490
Of course.

640
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,530
But I wonder

641
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,650
what you want to know.

642
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,490
It must be something about my love.

643
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,730
Your love?

644
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,850
There are so many sets in finding your love.

645
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,970
Why?

646
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,930
It's not precise

647
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,410
only by reading your palms.

648
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,770
Do you know something about reading bones?

649
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,130
So you also master that skill, Miss?

650
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,090
I only know a little.

651
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,050
But I can know

652
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,770
all the secrets

653
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,010
that the one has.

654
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,970
Go ahead, Miss.

655
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,970
The bones of the one who practices kongfu
is special.

656
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,770
Will I know it

657
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,930
at such degree?

658
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,970
What're you doing, Jin Baiwan?

659
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,130
I knew it.

660
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,290
I knew why you

661
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,930
asked things about him.

662
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,610
You have a crush on my cousin.

663
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,450
No.

664
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,450
Yes.

665
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,210
We can't see our engagement as a child's play.

666
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,250
Somehow,

667
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,850
I have to marry her

668
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,330
for Taoyuan Valley's sake.

669
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,810
It's not about the engagement.

670
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,250
He doesn't love me actually.

671
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,930
Miss...

672
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,930
Miss Jin

673
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,290
May I call your

674
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,570
given name in the future?

675
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,130
Miss Muqiu

676
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,850
What happened?

677
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,690
The fruit is for you

678
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,770
to quench your thirst.

679
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,490
You got it by yourself?

680
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,450
Yeah.

681
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,450
Young master

682
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:20,850
Young master

683
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,050
What you ordered

684
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:22,770
are all prepared.

685
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,690
You can have a check.

686
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,570
Okay.

687
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,970
Miss Muqiu

688
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,450
I will leave first.

689
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,410
He picked some fruit for me,

690
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,810
so it means

691
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,770
he kind of loves me.

692
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,930
The fruits picked by young master are sweet.

693
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,730
He's so nice.

694
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,450
I...

695
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,570
It's not sweet.

696
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,410
You haven't found her?

697
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,690
Jin Baiwan...

698
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,010
She disappeared

699
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,490
after the lanterns show.

700
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,490
There must be someone

701
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,570
helping her to hide the track.

702
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,290
But I've found something else.

703
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,970
I found

704
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,010
the sacred book

705
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,410
is for a person

706
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,850
named Qing Songke.

707
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,370
Qing Songke...

708
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,570
Do you know

709
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,730
the school he belongs to?

710
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,690
I'm on it, my lord.

711
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,690
I will go back to the palace

712
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,810
and report it to the Lord.

713
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,090
You must find the escort

714
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,450
as soon as possible.

715
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,690
Don't let anyone else get

716
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,850
the sacred book.

717
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,130
Got it, my lord.

718
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,090
On the lanterns show, you said that

719
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,930
you might meet me before.

720
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,850
May I know

721
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,970
where did we meet?

722
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,210
I got it!

723
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,890
You got it?

724
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,330
You played the Guqin in Jin's Escort Agency

725
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,410
on the Huazhao Conference three years ago.

726
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,370
You were

727
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,850
the Guqin Player in blue dress, right?

728
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,650
Did I say something wrong?

729
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,490
Miss Jin

730
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,090
Did you really grow up

731
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,850
in the escort agency?

732
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,650
Miss Qu

733
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,970
Are you alright?

734
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,010
-What happened? -What to do now?

735
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,570
Step aside.

736
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,330
Does it hurt?

737
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,330
No.

738
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,930
Fortunately, that's not a venomous snake.

739
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,010
I just

740
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,490
left to get some fruits.

741
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,690
Then she put you in such a position.

742
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,650
It's because of my carelessness.

743
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,770
It's not her fault.

744
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,610
Why are you on her side now?

745
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,730
You've been nice to her along the journey,

746
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,010
but you didn't treat me like that.

747
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,850
Miss Jin is pure and simple.

748
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,170
Miss Su

749
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,450
Don't be hostile to her.

750
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,970
Did I?

751
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm going to find

752
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,610
some herbs for you.

753
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,370
Does that hurt?

754
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,050
It hurts.

755
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,650
I'm sorry.

756
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,210
It happened suddenly.

757
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,210
It's not your fault.

758
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,090
Mr Qu

759
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,570
You've been helping me along the journey,

760
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,810
however, I not only put you in such a position

761
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,570
but also lied to you.

762
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,370
What does that mean?

763
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,490
I didn't tell you the truth

764
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,450
when you asked me about my experience.

765
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,290
In facts, I was took to Jin's Escort Agency

766
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,489
five years ago.

767
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:09,650
Five years ago?

768
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,090
I lost all the memories

769
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,130
before that.

770
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,290
But my young female master told me that

771
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,650
I couldn't tell my experience

772
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,330
to anyone.

773
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,810
So I lied

774
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,850
to you.

775
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,090
I have nothing to

776
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,570
pay your debt of gratitude.

777
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:27,810
But I have a pendant.

778
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,610
Although it's valueless,

779
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,969
I've been wearing it all the time.

780
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,889
I can give it to you

781
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,610
if you don't mind.
