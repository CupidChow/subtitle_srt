[Fall in Love with a Fox]
[EP20]

3
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,140
Stop.

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,900
Er? I am so confused.

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,020
Didn't you two get married?

6
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,940
Stop pretending.

7
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,500
Shut up.

8
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:02,940
If you continue to

9
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,980
hold the token,

10
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,060
you'll be in a more dangerous condition.

11
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,740
I can't be eliminated.

12
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,380
Lingyao Herb must be mine.

13
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,180
Ok, you'll get the Lingyao Herb,

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
only if you quit.

15
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,260
No way.

16
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,100
Are you sure?

17
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,740
Listen,

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,380
stop where you are.

19
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,060
Leave me alone.

20
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,220
Since it is so,

21
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,620
ok,

22
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,820
I see.

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,860
Silly girl,

24
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,340
you didn't expect it to happen, right?

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,260
Are you really going to do this to me?

26
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,820
What are you doing?

27
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,380
I can't convince you.

28
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,180
Since you have to do this,

29
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,579
I'll be with you.

30
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,700
Qu Zheng

31
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,820
You're the Lord of Tingqin Garden.

32
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,980
Do you really want to betray us?

33
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,660
It's just tergiversation.

34
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,740
As for me,

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,140
it's nothing.

36
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,500
Are you going to switch sides?

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,420
I sincerely invited you to the blue team,

38
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,220
but you refused me.

39
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,940
So, I have no way but join you.

40
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,940
Let's go.

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,540
Get up.

42
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,460
Catch them.

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,700
Over there.

44
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,020
Guys,

45
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,940
I was careless.

46
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,380
Qu Zheng didn't keep his words.

47
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,220
He betrayed us.

48
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,500
Follow them.

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,700
Let's go.

50
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,100
Baiwan

51
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,180
Qiuer

52
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,620
Baiwan

53
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,620
Qiuer

54
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,620
Mr Yu

55
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,220
Could you please

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,300
stop following me?

57
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,420
I only want to help Baiwan

58
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,300
to get the Lingyao Herb now.

59
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,900
But I have to make sure

60
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,780
you're safe.

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,700
Thank you,

62
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,980
but I don't need your help

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,420
Baiwan

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,900
Muqiu

65
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,580
Are you alright?

66
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm fine.

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,340
Over there.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,140
Come on.

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,140
What happened?

70
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,780
No,

71
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,460
I have to send the token off.

72
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,660
Muqiu

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,460
Muqiu

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,220
He really betrayed us.

75
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Go.

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,700
Baiwan

77
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,700
Muqiu

78
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,340
Great. I made it.

79
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,500
Wonderful.

80
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Game over.

81
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
The red team obviously won more tokens

82
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
than the blue team.

83
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,540
In this battle of martial arts by the lake,

84
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,860
the red team won.

85
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,020
Great.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,020
Muqiu, great.

87
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,140
I made it.

88
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,500
Cheers!

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,220
Welcome to come again.

90
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,740
I didn't expect

91
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,180
that you were so lucky

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,620
in the first round

93
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,740
and survived.

94
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,659
It's not because of luck.

95
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,540
At the height of the crisis,

96
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,820
Baiwan

97
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,580
made vigorous efforts to turn the situation.

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,700
That's why entire red team

99
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,740
could survive.

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,900
How powerful she was!

101
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,980
But where's she?

102
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,460
She told us to eat first.

103
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,500
She said that

104
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,060
she wanted to talk to Lord Qu.

105
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,860
Did she go to

106
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,900
that villain?

107
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,420
Let me tell you something.

108
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,020
Thanks to

109
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,140
Lord Qu's

110
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,940
switched his sides this time in the end

111
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,420
and stop the blue team,

112
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,980
or we'll be

113
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,460
all eliminated.

114
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,420
Did you say

115
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,100
that in order to help you, Qu Zheng

116
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,820
be...

117
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,620
betrayed his team?

118
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,260
It's just a game.

119
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,620
Are there any influence

120
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,340
of switching camps?

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Did you regard the battle of martial arts by the lake
by the lake as a child game?

122
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
The battle is to test

123
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,220
the stand and integrity of the competitors.

124
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,340
The lord

125
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,060
Qu Zheng

126
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,580
As the lord,

127
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,820
he became a traitor.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,700
He'll definitely

129
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,540
be condemned.

130
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,940
Well,

131
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,540
Lord Qu

132
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,659
has sacrificed so much

133
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,820
to help Baiwan.

134
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,220
He should be the last person

135
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,180
who wants her

136
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,540
memory back.

137
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,020
Moreover,

138
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,780
didn't their engagement

139
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,860
has been cancelled?

140
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
In my view,

141
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,500
the story between them

142
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,020
is not that simple.

143
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,060
I didn't expect

144
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,060
that you

145
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,940
left Tingqin Garden so determinedly,

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,780
but you come to me today.

147
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,380
Why did you help me?

148
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,420
Help you?

149
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,900
In the battle of martial arts by the lake,

150
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,300
it seems that you were trying to take my token,

151
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,380
and disturbed me,

152
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,780
but actually you were

153
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,100
helping me on purpose.

154
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,340
Do you think I'm obsessed with you?

155
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Or, you hope

156
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,980
I'll still have feelings for you?

157
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,900
You can't get away with this.

158
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
I am not.

159
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,500
Yes, I'm still obsessed with you.

160
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,340
Since you left Tingqin Garden,

161
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,940
I missed you every day.

162
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,220
My mind settled down

163
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,020
until I saw you today.

164
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,980
Stop it.

165
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,300
I just want to know

166
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,380
why you came to the battle of martial arts by the lake,

167
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,820
and why you wanted the Lingyao Herb.

168
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,780
Because of you.

169
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,540
What?

170
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,260
The battle of martial arts by the lake

171
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,180
is not as simple

172
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,980
as you think.

173
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,620
You came alone.

174
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,420
I was worried.

175
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,140
Do you think

176
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,260
I'll still believe in your words?

177
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,780
No matter you trust me or not,

178
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,940
I'll help you to get the Lingyao Herb.

179
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,380
And find your memory back.

180
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,100
Cheers.

181
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,980
Why hasn't Baiwan come yet?

182
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,740
I'm sleepy,

183
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,460
and hungry.

184
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,539
Let me try the dishes first.

185
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,340
Baiwan shouldn't blame me, right?

186
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,260
What?

187
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,020
Dad

188
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Yu... Lord of Valley...

189
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,020
Tea, please.

190
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,620
Thank you, Miss Jin.

191
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,220
Qiuer

192
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,620
I'll speak frankly.

193
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,500
What happened between you and Linfeng

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,140
during these days

195
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,940
are clear to us.

196
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,620
That's just a little

197
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,420
bickering between each other.

198
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,660
How come you make it

199
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,780
on the battle of martial arts by the lake?

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,820
Dad

201
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,300
It's not bickering.

202
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,620
So,

203
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,740
you've thought it through.

204
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,380
You did want to divorce Fenger.

205
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,100
Qiuer

206
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,740
Linfeng has come to our house

207
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,740
to pick you up.

208
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,060
Dad

209
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,540
Lord of Valley Yu

210
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,020
I got it figured out this time.

211
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Mr Yu and I are not a good match.

212
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,180
Divorce is the best option.

213
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,340
Please try to persuade him to return.

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,700
Do you think I didn't?

215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,420
Dad

216
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,780
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,980
But if I can't get Qiuer back,

218
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,500
I'll stay here.

219
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,420
You...

220
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,020
You unfilial boy.

221
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,540
Don't you think it's embarrassed enough?

222
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,220
You've lost all the dignity

223
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,860
of Taoyuan Valley.

224
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,780
Dad

225
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,020
Even though you think I'm disobedient,

226
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,420
I still have to get Qiuer back

227
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,780
this time.

228
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,780
Even though you think I'm disobedient.

229
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,220
You...

230
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,780
I've made up my mind

231
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,140
to be with her.

232
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,740
Since Miss Jin

233
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
has decided to divorce,

234
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,700
that's fine.

235
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,500
Miss Jin

236
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,580
Please help me to persuade him,

237
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,820
just in case that he won't give up the idea.

238
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,420
OK.

239
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,340
I

240
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,540
didn't want you

241
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,540
to divorce at first.

242
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,340
But since you've made up your mind,

243
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,220
you should make yourself clear as soon as possible.

244
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,340
Merry meet, merry part.

245
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,300
And don't

246
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,580
contact again.

247
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,580
I see.

248
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,260
Qi, why are you here?

249
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,100
I told you my name is not Qi.

250
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,100
My name is Qingyun.

251
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,100
Sorry, I...

252
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,340
You don't need to apologize.

253
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,020
If I had taken good care of you

254
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,300
five years ago,

255
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,740
you wouldn't have become like this.

256
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,020
I saw

257
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,060
Qu Zheng was bothering you again.

258
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,900
No, he wasn't.

259
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,660
He...

260
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,380
I saw

261
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,380
what he did today.

262
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,740
I won't let him

263
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,580
get the Lingyao Herb.

264
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,540
No, that's a mistake.

265
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,180
Why do you still defending him?

266
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,940
I'm the only one

267
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,900
you should trust.

268
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,780
You became the defector today.

269
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,180
Won't Nonuple Palace come after you?

270
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,300
You're worried about me.

271
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,740
Because we're friends.

272
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,900
But I don't want to

273
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,500
just be your friend.

274
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,420
Please rest assured.

275
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,620
I'll get the Lingyao Herb as soon as possible.

276
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,980
Just wait.

277
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,260
Who?

278
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,140
Why are you here?

279
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,940
You came to steal the Lingyao Herb

280
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,180
for her.

281
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,380
Since you knew,

282
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,220
step away.

283
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,860
Lingyao Herb is related to the Majesty's plan.

284
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm not gonna let you do this.

285
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,140
If you want to live,

286
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,180
just move away.

287
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,980
What if I'm the one stopping you?

288
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,100
Your Majesty

289
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,820
In the battle of martial arts by the lake,

290
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,220
you switched your sides

291
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,380
without permission.

292
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,220
I haven't punished you yet,

293
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,140
and you acted recklessly

294
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,900
to steal the Lingyao Herb at night.

295
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,180
What a pity!

296
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,900
It is now guarded

297
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,060
by every people in Alliance.

298
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,740
Do you think we will hide it here?

299
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,340
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,660
For what?

301
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,380
I disturbed your plan many times.

302
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,260
I should take the blame.

303
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,540
Envoy Xueyue

304
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,460
As for what Young Host of Palace did,

305
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,060
according to the rules of Nonuple Palace,

306
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,500
what punishment should he take?

307
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,900
Your Majesty

308
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,620
Young Host of Palace has known that he was wrong.

309
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,340
He was just confused.

310
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,860
Now he's punished.

311
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Look.

312
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,260
look,

313
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,420
the one who really cares about your life

314
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,020
is right in front of you.

315
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,580
Yet you risked your life

316
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,740
for a woman

317
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,980
who doesn't deserve it?

318
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
You

319
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,380
raised me up.

320
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,420
My life is at your disposal.

321
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,940
What you did

322
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,340
is a huge mistake.

323
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,660
But,

324
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,540
I can spare you today.

325
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
That's because

326
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,980
I have a task for you.

327
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,220
At your service.

328
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,220
Kill Qu Zheng.

329
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
The reason you want the Lingyao Herb

330
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,140
is to please

331
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,060
Chu.

332
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,500
She's Jin Baiwan now.

333
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,100
But don't forget

334
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,020
that even if she gets her memory back,

335
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,180
there's Qu Zheng beside her.

336
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,540
As long as Qu Zheng's alive,

337
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,260
when will Chu

338
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,460
come back to your side?

339
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,380
Are you worried that

340
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,980
you can't defeat Qu Zheng, right?

341
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,020
I fought against him before.

342
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,140
He's really

343
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,780
powerful.

344
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Relax,

345
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,740
I have my plan

346
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,980
to help you

347
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,380
to defeat Qu Zheng.

348
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,780
Excuse me! Excuse me!

349
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,380
Thanks. Thanks.

350
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,700
Baiwan, look.

351
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,540
Our names are really

352
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,860
on the challenge list.

353
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,420
Jin Baiwan of Jin's Escort Agency

354
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,300
vs. Jiuxing of Nonuple Palace.

355
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,340
He is from Nonuple Palace...

356
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,060
Baiwan

357
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
If you're really from

358
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,180
Nonuple Palace,

359
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
you're going to challenge your own people.

360
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,260
Stop the nonsense.

361
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,620
It's impossible.

362
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,220
I just want to know

363
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,580
that if I could defeat him or not.

364
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,780
Baiwan, relax.

365
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Although people from the battle of martial arts by the lake will arrange

366
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,660
the competition order for us,

367
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,460
we can change it

368
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,340
in private.

369
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,820
If you're worried,

370
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,420
you can change the opponent.

371
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,180
Qu Zheng

372
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,220
How dare you come?

373
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,220
If you are not switching sides,

374
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,540
our Fengyun Heights,

375
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,940
wouldn't be wiped out all.

376
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,740
Yes, right.

377
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,540
Yes.

378
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,740
As the grandmaster,

379
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,700
you're so insidious and shameless,

380
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,100
and without a clear stand.

381
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,660
What I did

382
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,540
is all in line with the rules of the battle of martial arts by the lake.

383
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,700
There's no shame in it.

384
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,100
Qu Zheng, you're the one

385
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,860
who broke the rules.

386
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,540
How dare you mention the rules!

387
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,660
Mr Yu, what do you mean?

388
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,700
What do I mean?

389
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Stop pretending.

390
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,100
I just talked to

391
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,060
the judge

392
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,020
from Nonuple Palace.

393
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
The tokens handed in

394
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,260
at the end of the battle

395
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,220
by Jin Baiwan and Qu Zheng

396
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,580
are fake.

397
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,140
They hid tokens in the woods.

398
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,700
What happened?

399
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,460
Look!

400
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,819
The real token of battle of martial arts by the lake

401
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,740
is made of black iron.

402
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,020
So it can't be broken.

403
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,220
And these are

404
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,140
the tokens handed in

405
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,339
by Qu Zheng and Jin Baiwan.

406
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,180
Nonsense!

407
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,780
How could we lie?

408
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,380
Yes.

409
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,660
Of course, you two girls

410
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,819
have no guts to do this.

411
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,099
Someone else

412
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,859
did it.

413
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,420
So you mean

414
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,020
I did it.

415
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,740
What's your evidence?

416
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,180
You always

417
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,260
resort to extreme measures.

418
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,340
It's an evil deed.

419
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,980
How could you possibly leave evidence?

420
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,860
Am I right?

421
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,740
Yes.

422
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Right.

423
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,140
Well,

424
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,300
Mr Yu

425
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,180
is a rare expert in arguing.

426
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,580
Of course, I am.

427
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,220
So, when you accuse me,

428
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,700
you need no evidence.

429
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,100
All by your will.

430
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,180
The evidence is overwhelming. Stop denying.

431
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,180
Judges

432
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,860
If someone broke the rules of
the battle of martial arts by the lake,

433
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,900
what is the result?

434
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,020
According to our rules,

435
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,660
if someone lies,

436
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,980
he'll be punished, severely.

437
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,220
He will be beaten 81 times with a stick.

438
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,100
If it's serious,
the results will be cancelled,

439
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,780
and he'll be kicked out of
the battle of martial arts by the lake.

440
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,620
Cheating?

441
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,140
It's young master Yu Chen

442
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,500
pointed it out in public,

443
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,940
and he found

444
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,180
a disciple of our party to testify.

445
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
How come there's such a stupid guy

446
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,500
in Nonuple Palace?

447
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,900
Follow me.

448
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,780
So the final winner

449
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,900
should be us, the blue team,

450
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,460
right?

451
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,380
Yes.

452
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,740
There're so many competitors in the woods,

453
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,300
and also judges of Nonuple Palace.

454
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,660
If we really want to hide the tokens,

455
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,580
how can we achieve it

456
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,260
without being noticed?

457
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,380
Baiwan is right.

458
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,780
We really don't have selfish motives.

459
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,340
We?

460
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,500
Guys,

461
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,540
Qu Zheng and Jin Baiwan

462
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,020
are on opposing sides.

463
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
Since they used the word "we",

464
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,620
it's obvious collusion.

465
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,540
Yes.

466
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,100
I knew them.

467
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,060
They are working hand in glove with each other.

468
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,540
Yes, they're.

469
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,460
No need to explain.

470
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,020
Mr Yu, please don't forget

471
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,940
that battle of martial arts by the lake

472
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,660
is supervised by Kung Fu Master.

473
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,060
If he finds out

474
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,820
that it's not true,

475
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,700
Mr Yu,

476
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,220
you'll be in trouble.

477
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,540
The evidence is certain.

478
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,060
I'm not afraid.

479
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,900
Since then,

480
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
I'll check whether it's true.

481
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,900
Host Jing Yuan

482
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,260
Host Jing Yuan

483
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
Cheating in the battle of martial arts by the lake

484
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,620
is a big problem.

485
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,380
As

486
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,940
a disciple of Nonuple Palace,

487
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,540
you should be clear that

488
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,180
if you hide anything,

489
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,740
what you will encounter.

490
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,140
Your Majesty, I was wrong.

491
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,580
Mr Yu paid me a lot

492
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,620
to change the tokens.

493
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,700
Please forgive me.

494
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,060
Please forgive me.

495
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Nonsense!

496
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,340
I was careless.

497
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,260
Ok, it seems that we've got the truth.

498
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
We failed to provide good education to our people.

499
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,340
So, the people with an ulterior motive

500
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,740
had a loophole to exploit.

501
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,540
Thank you for being fair, Host.

502
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,820
Please rest assured.

503
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,300
The battle of martial arts by the lake,

504
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,940
always put justice priority.

505
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,980
Since

506
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,140
such an unfair thing

507
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,660
happened today,

508
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,340
I'll deal with it severely.

509
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,340
I'm sure you'll get

510
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,980
a satisfactory reply.

511
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,620
Mr Yu is disqualified.

512
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,420
Now, please follow me.

513
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,340
Look, as I said.

514
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,380
He deserved it.

515
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,820
You got the truth.

516
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,660
This should be over.

517
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,340
We can also relax now.

518
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,380
It was a slip of the tongue.

519
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,900
There's no "we".

520
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,180
But I like it.

521
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,060
You said "we" when you're worried,

522
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,860
which means

523
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,620
you still like me.

524
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,420
Cunning fox, leave me alone.

525
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,380
What are you doing?

526
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,780
You smiled all the time,

527
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,180
which made me awkward.

528
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,180
What's wrong?

529
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
Qingyun

530
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,020
Is he the Young Host of Palace?

531
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,540
Let's go.

532
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,100
It has been five years.

533
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,980
I can finally sit down,

534
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,860
and have a meal with you.

535
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,860
You helped me so much

536
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,060
in the competition.

537
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,340
I feel really gratitude for you.

538
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,820
We don't need to be so polite

539
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,020
to each other.

540
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,940
Your eel noodles.

541
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,820
Thank you.

542
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,060
Beef noodles.

543
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,100
Ouch, it hurts.

544
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,860
I said

545
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,140
no shredded ginger in her noodles.

546
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,060
It's ok. I can eat it.

547
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,700
Thank you. Thank you.

548
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,180
What... what's wrong with you?

549
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,620
Nothing.

550
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,380
Did they punish you

551
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,300
because you switched sides for me

552
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,420
in the competition?

553
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,620
It's nothing serious.

554
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,740
You don't have to worry about me.

555
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,140
You're lucky. Zhuozhuo told me

556
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,340
to take Medication for Wound Infection with me.

557
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,580
Let me rub it to you.

558
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,820
When I was injured in past,

559
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,940
you did it for me, too.

560
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,180
But at that time

561
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,180
I couldn't see you.

562
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,140
But have you ever think about

563
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,220
that I'm not the one you're looking for?

564
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,740
I eat shredded ginger.

565
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,820
Maybe

566
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,140
you made a mistake.

567
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,780
I will never misrecognize

568
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,020
your voice.

569
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,300
You just forgot it.

570
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,340
When your memory is back,

571
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,980
everything will be

572
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,020
just the way it was.

573
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,420
As for what you hated,

574
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,780
you'll still hate it.

575
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,780
As for what you loved,

576
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,980
you'll still love it with no change.

577
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,980
How come things become like this?

578
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,460
Could it be that I shouldn't send money?

579
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,860
Not really.

580
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
I see.

581
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
I sent money to the wrong man.

582
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,340
What do you mean?

583
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,540
Think about it.

584
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,700
Jing Yuan

585
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,260
He's the boss of the battle of martial arts by the lake.

586
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,500
He should be the one receiving the money.

587
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,260
You're so clever.

588
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,340
Ok, you guys can go back first.

589
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,660
I have to finish it.

590
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,100
Go.

591
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,580
OK.

592
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,900
Your water is ready.

593
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,020
Come in, please.

594
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,860
You are working in hand with him.

595
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,580
Please enjoy it.

596
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,180
Wait.

597
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,260
Although I don't know your ideas,

598
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,140
since you asked,

599
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,580
I'll do it.

600
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,900
Don't, don't come over.

601
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,460
Get dressed first.

602
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,500
I just want to tell you

603
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,980
not to use that bathwater.

604
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,620
What do you mean?

605
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,060
There's something wrong with the bathwater.

606
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,060
Just now...

607
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,060
Itchy!

608
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,460
The reason why there's something wrong with the bathwater

609
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,220
is also because of you.

610
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,180
I didn't expect

611
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,540
that these people

612
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,580
are so foxy.

613
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,980
There're strict rules in Fengyun Heights.

614
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,500
I didn't expect their disciples

615
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,060
are so contemptible.

616
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,980
Did you recognize him already?

617
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,460
They just

618
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,940
disguised a little.

619
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,380
It's easy to be recognized.

620
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,460
What's more,

621
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,260
if I don't play my cards right,

622
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,060
how could I

623
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,380
catch them?

624
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,500
I was meddling.

625
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,540
Baiwan

626
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,700
You could

627
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,900
stand aside just now,

628
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,940
why did you

629
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,060
warn me especially?

630
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,820
You gave me a hand in the competition.

631
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,060
It's called being grateful.

632
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,780
Is this gratitude,

633
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,620
or you still have a crush

634
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,740
on me?

635
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,980
Are you kidding?

636
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,220
Your feelings for me are all fake.

637
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,140
My feelings for you

638
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,340
are not real either.

639
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,780
Really?

640
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,820
Yes, of course.

641
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,700
But, I know

642
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,260
you're lying.

643
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,460
How do you know my thought?

644
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,140
You're now thinking

645
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,540
that I've done a lot of evil things.

646
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,500
So that's how our relationship

647
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,620
ends like this, right?

648
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,060
But what if I tell you

649
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,740
that I've done

650
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,100
nothing evil?

651
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,900
You're full of lies.

652
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,380
I won't believe you again.

653
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,620
Baiwan

654
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,820
You've known me for so long.

655
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,780
Do you really think

656
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,460
that I would do

657
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,980
those bad things?

658
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,780
You're always

659
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,260
telling the truth together with lies.

660
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,700
Lies together with truth.

661
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,980
It's hard to figure out which one is true.

662
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Stop hiding it.

663
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,180
I know it's the hair clasp

664
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,740
given by Qu Zheng.

665
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,340
It's broken.

666
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,020
But you still cherish it so much.

667
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,220
No, I'm not hiding.

668
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,940
I don't cherish it.

669
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,900
I just need it

670
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,500
to remind me all the time

671
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,940
not to trust him again.

672
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,140
They all said

673
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,940
that Lord Qu

674
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
is a demon.

675
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,340
But he seems

676
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,020
fine to me.

677
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,820
Don't be fooled by him.

678
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
If he's really

679
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,460
a bad guy,

680
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,460
why would he help you in the competition?

681
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,940
Well,

682
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,340
would that what happened
about Puyuan Canon

683
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,580
be a mistake?

684
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,780
Could he

685
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,300
go to the battle of martial arts by the lake

686
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,940
to help you to get Lingyao Herb?

687
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,780
No way.

688
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
He must be up

689
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,940
to something else.

690
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,100
Just admit it.

691
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,260
You care about him.

692
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,500
If you have questions,

693
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,980
go and

694
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,300
ask him.

695
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,380
You need communication.

696
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,180
He is just a cunning fox.

697
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,020
Full of lies.

698
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,500
Why would I believe in his words?

699
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,500
So,

700
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,140
since words can deceive,

701
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,900
don't listen to him,

702
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,020
watch him talking

703
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,340
instead.

704
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,620
Watch?

705
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,780
Words can deceive,

706
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,460
but

707
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,340
eyes can't.

708
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,300
No matter who he is,

709
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,740
as long as

710
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,180
you look at his eyes,

711
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,700
you'll get what you want

712
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,340
from his eyes.

713
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,580
Really?

714
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,740
Baiwan

715
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,380
Look at my eyes,

716
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,420
and tell me.

717
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,820
If you have to

718
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,900
make a choice

719
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,380
between Lord Qu

720
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,540
and the scary Qingyun,

721
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
who will you choose?

722
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,660
No one.

723
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,740
One is a liar,

724
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,500
and another one has nothing to do with me.

725
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,980
Neither of them is a good choice.

726
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,380
Look at my eyes.

727
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,820
Listen,

728
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,860
you will definitely choose Lord Qu.

729
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,260
Answer me.

730
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,540
Mr Yu came to you from a long distance,

731
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,820
are you happy with it?

732
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,380
No, I'm not.

733
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,700
Look at my eyes,

734
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,820
and answer me again.

735
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,700
I...

736
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,780
Jin Baiwan

737
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,900
Jin Muqiu, answer me.

738
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,100
Are you happy?

739
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
Yes, I'm.

740
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
I knew it!

741
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,660
But

742
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,740
I can't be happy now.

743
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,340
Me as well.

744
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,940
What's wrong?

745
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,700
This jade hair clasp has lost

746
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,740
a piece after all.

747
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,420
You hold it

748
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,540
and look at it all day long.

749
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,780
And you come all the way

750
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,300
to her.

751
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,140
As far as I'm concerned,

752
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,460
you'd better go to her,

753
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,420
and explain to her.

754
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,860
Explain what?

755
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,220
To explain

756
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,300
that you're not

757
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,500
the bad guy in her mind.

758
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,980
And you also need to explain

759
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,980
that five years ago,

760
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,060
you've known each other and fallen in love.

761
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,860
She'll figure out everything

762
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,220
after she gets the Lingyao Herb.

763
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,500
When she figures it all out,

764
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,380
what if she can't believe it?

765
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,020
I'll bear it

766
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,220
and face it with her

767
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
no matter what happens then.

768
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,540
Dad

769
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,500
The movement you taught me,

770
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,260
I've just practiced for a few days,

771
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,220
and I've improved a lot.

772
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,380
Great.

773
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,700
It was not a vain effort

774
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,380
that I taught you this.

775
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,460
But

776
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,220
I never see it before.

777
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,660
Which school does it belong to?

778
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,580
Don't you dare pry into my affairs!

779
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,900
I'm sorry.

780
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,100
Dad

781
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,500
Don't come over.

782
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,740
I taught you this

783
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,380
because I want you

784
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,020
kill Qu Zheng on the ring.

785
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,420
If you failed me,

786
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,900
I'm sure

787
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,740
you know the results.

788
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,900
I see.

789
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,620
I'll practice hard.

790
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,060
No private battle during the battle of martial arts by the lake?

791
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,020
Damn it!

792
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,100
After the competition,

793
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,740
we'll

794
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,940
show Qu Zheng how great we are.

795
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,940
Right.

796
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:30,980
What's that?

797
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,220
What's that?

798
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,780
No breaths sighing.

799
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,060
Someone's dead.

800
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,940
Help! Help!

801
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,820
What's wrong?

802
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,500
Someone's dead.

803
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,460
What happened?

804
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,140
Someone's dead.

805
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,940
Who's he?

806
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,260
It's Qu Zheng who killed Mr Yu.

807
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,860
Qu Zheng, how dare you!

808
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Do you have any evidence

809
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,740
that I killed Mr Yu?
