[EP17]

3
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,220
I don't care if

4
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,940
you're going to blame me or not.

5
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,780
I just want to see you safe and sound.

6
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,259
My lord

7
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,340
My lord, are you all right?

8
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,380
Get the carriage and

9
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,500
escort Mrs Qu

10
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,620
to Tingqin Garden.

11
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,860
Roger that.

12
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,180
Have you found Lord Qu?

13
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,340
He's escorting Mrs Qu

14
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,380
back to Tingqin Garden now.

15
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,220
Good.

16
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,100
How's Baiwan?

17
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,900
Is she all right?

18
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,220
She's in a coma right now.

19
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,060
Nothing serious.

20
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,540
Well,

21
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,540
Lord of Valley Junior Yu

22
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,340
Mrs Jin

23
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,620
Don't worry then.

24
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,100
I'm going back to Tingqin Garden right away.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,260
Quier

26
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,780
At the moment,

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,900
Miss Baiwan is fine.

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,820
How about we go back

29
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,660
to Taoyuan Valley together?

30
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,700
Right, Young Mrs.

31
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,700
In any case,

32
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,460
it's time for you

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,380
to go back with us.

34
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,060
But you just heard that

35
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,260
Baiwan is in a coma.

36
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,100
I gotta go to Tingqin Garden

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,140
to take care of her.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,540
It's...

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,540
Young Mrs

40
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,220
I...

41
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,220
I really need to

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,780
have a talk with you.

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,060
Jueming

44
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,140
Lord of Valley Junior has been...

45
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,540
Quier

46
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,660
If you don't want to go back

47
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,580
to Taoyuan Valley,

48
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,620
it's okay for us to head for Jin's Escort Agency.

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,780
How about this?

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,940
We go traveling

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,860
and sightseeing

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,100
until you're in the mood

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,140
to go back to Taoyuan Valley.

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,460
You have my word.

55
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,500
No one will blame you

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,300
after you

57
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,140
are back.

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,900
It seems that

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,260
you still have no idea

60
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,700
why I left Taoyuan Valley.

61
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,100
Never mind.

62
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,780
I don't feel like talking about it.

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,500
Now it's the time Baiwan

64
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,700
needs me.

65
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,820
I have to look after her.

66
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,100
Qiuer

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,180
Brother Shu

68
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,980
Thank you for

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,100
your care all along the way.

70
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,620
Brother Shu

71
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,180
What Qiuer fears is not your blame

72
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,620
but you never know me.

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,140
Baiwan, you're awake.

74
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,540
You're awake.

75
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,780
This is the medicine

76
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,860
Lord Qu asked me to prepare.

77
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,620
Where is he?

78
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,460
Baiwan

79
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,140
Baiwan

80
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,540
Aren't you taking the medicine?

81
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,540
Something happened yesterday.

82
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,460
We don't need to use

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,100
this wedding dress temporarily.

84
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,380
Put it away.

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,180
Zheng

86
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,940
The poison in your body has not been cleared.

87
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
It's not the time for any exercise.

88
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,180
Why not consult Su Zhouzhou

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,940
about the illness?

90
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,420
Baiwan would find out

91
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,540
if she knows.

92
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,460
This is no time

93
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,860
to worry that whether she'd know it or not.

94
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,460
She already knew about

95
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,500
Xing Laoliu.

96
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,500
What?

97
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,300
Qu Zheng

98
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,659
You've just back, Miss Jin.

99
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,940
Why not have a good rest first?

100
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,740
Shut up.

101
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,900
How long are you going to hide it from me?

102
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,740
Jianshan, give us a moment.

103
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,620
But...

104
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,820
Get out.

105
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,780
The cases of Canon,

106
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,700
and Xing Laoliu.

107
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,740
They are both done by you,

108
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,580
right?

109
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,700
Right.

110
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,700
Tricking me into engagement

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,140
and going to Taoyuan Valley

112
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,340
were also part of your plan,

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,380
right?

114
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,460
Right.

115
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,580
You knew from the beginning that

116
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,300
I am the disciple of Nonuple Palace.

117
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,380
So you never wanted

118
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,580
my memory to get back.

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,540
You were afraid that your plan would come to

120
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,220
nothing when I remember everything, right?

121
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,180
No.

122
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,380
What else excuses do you got?

123
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,860
I belong to both Nonuple Palace

124
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,780
and Jin's Escort Agency.

125
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,940
Making use of me,

126
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,100
of course you can create confusion

127
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,860
to get the Canon,

128
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,060
am I right?

129
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,659
It never occurred to me

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,060
to drag you into all these conspiracies.

131
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,700
What if I tell you

132
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,540
my love for you has

133
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,060
never changed a little bit?

134
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,340
Do you believe it?

135
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
Of course I don't.

136
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,659
From now on,

137
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm not buying any

138
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,500
of your nonsense.

139
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,380
The whole world may not believe me,

140
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,260
but you, Baiwan,

141
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,740
you can't.

142
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,580
The only mistake I made is that

143
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,540
I trusted you too much.

144
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,660
All the things

145
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,260
were up to you.

146
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,660
All the things relied on you.

147
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,540
I've turned myself completely

148
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,060
to a fool.

149
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
I never expected that

150
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,220
the one who stands with me

151
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,540
but always schemes to plot against me

152
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
is you.

153
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,620
You really think so?

154
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,740
At this point,

155
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,300
what else excuses do you got?

156
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,860
What can you do to make up?

157
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,300
Now that whatever I say is pointless.

158
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,620
I got nothing to say.

159
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,260
Please leave me alone.

160
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,180
Baiwan

161
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,260
I can't tell you the truth

162
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,460
five years ago.

163
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,860
It interwove with the memory

164
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,980
you shouldn't remember.

165
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,660
I hate to see you know it.

166
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
And I can't see you hate yourself.

167
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,100
I'd rather let you hate me,

168
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,620
let you blame me.

169
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,860
My host

170
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,580
Who told you to stop?

171
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,980
Father

172
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,980
There's no father in the

173
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,540
Disciplining Hall.

174
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,460
My host

175
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,500
It was my fault.

176
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,380
I failed to take Chu back

177
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,700
as I promised.

178
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
I've given you

179
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,700
one chance.

180
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,980
It's all my fault.

181
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,620
I'd like

182
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,660
to received 100 more whips.

183
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,220
Will

184
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,260
your death

185
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,700
bring me

186
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,580
back

187
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,660
what I want?

188
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,140
I'll do it well,

189
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,580
whatever you ask,

190
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,860
father.

191
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,780
For the next time,

192
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
I shall certainly bring Chu back.

193
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,420
You've already

194
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,660
let me down once.

195
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,900
Now is your

196
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,460
last chance.

197
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,700
Young host,

198
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,100
the 200 whips are done.

199
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,060
Please go back to recuperate.

200
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,300
Qingyun

201
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,380
Come here.

202
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,500
Slow down.

203
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,180
Just laugh at me as you want.

204
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,820
I'm not here to laugh at you.

205
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,940
I got a doctor for you.

206
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,820
You are not coming for laughing at me,

207
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,340
so you're here to take care of me.

208
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,980
Your care

209
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,780
means nothing to me, like always.

210
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,100
Is it worth it?

211
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,100
She'd never know you have

212
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,820
received 200 whips for her.

213
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,820
She forgets everything.

214
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,460
With that Qu Zheng,

215
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,660
she would never

216
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,820
come back to you.

217
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,620
She just lost her memory.

218
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,420
She'll come back as long as she remembers it.

219
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,100
Now I understand.

220
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,540
You knew it clearly that

221
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,660
the failure of this task

222
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,460
would lead to heavy

223
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,300
or even life-threatening punishments.

224
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,140
But you still came back.

225
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,500
You knew it at the beginning that you

226
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,780
can't defeat Qu Zheng.

227
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,700
So you chose to come back and bring back

228
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,060
Chu with the help of the Host.

229
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,300
I won't forgive you twice

230
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,180
for these words.

231
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
It's me who has been

232
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,700
waiting you for all these years.

233
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,220
She is the only one in this world.

234
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,100
No one can compare with her.

235
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,220
Mrs Qu

236
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,940
The clay doll made by you and Lord Qu

237
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,580
has been done.

238
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,460
Get out.

239
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,740
But...

240
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,660
I said get out.

241
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,780
Mrs Qu

242
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,700
Mrs Qu

243
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,460
Baiwan

244
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Baiwan

245
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,060
Baiwan

246
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,460
Baiwan, say something.

247
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,100
Baiwan

248
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,220
Baiwan, are you all right?

249
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,500
Talk to us.

250
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,340
Baiwan

251
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,140
Baiwan, come on.

252
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,580
Baiwan, don't cry.

253
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,180
Get out here.

254
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,060
Just speak to us.

255
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,700
Baiwan

256
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,780
Open the door.

257
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,580
Don't keep it bottled up.

258
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,820
Talk to us.

259
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,420
Right, talk to us.

260
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,940
Let us help you.

261
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,060
Don't cry by yourself, Baiwan.

262
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,100
Don't cry.

263
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,060
Baiwan

264
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:43,940
You...

265
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,860
You come out.

266
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,980
We'll cry with you.

267
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,540
Do you hear us, Baiwan.

268
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,820
Baiwan, open the door.

269
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,060
Let us in.

270
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,380
Or you get out here.

271
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,180
Baiwan

272
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,860
Even if you hate me or blame me,

273
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,500
I won't tell you the truth

274
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,540
happened five years ago.

275
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,260
I hope you are

276
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,660
simple and happy.

277
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,100
Rather than being the Envoy Xueyue

278
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,100
with bloody hands.

279
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Toady,

280
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,380
all of you come to Nonuple Palace

281
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
for the case of Qu Zheng

282
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,700
of Tingqin Garden, presumably.

283
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,540
Qu Zheng not only made a sneak attack
against the guests

284
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,980
on the wedding night,

285
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,500
but also harmed people outside Tingqin Garden.

286
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,980
He looked down upon we

287
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,580
Alliance of Martial Arts.

288
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,180
At the beginning, he talked big

289
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,500
to investigate

290
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,220
the case of Puyuan Canon.

291
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,740
In my view,

292
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,100
it was his trick.

293
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,700
What's more,

294
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,820
I heard that the girl he brought away

295
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,540
the other night, Jin Baiwan,

296
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,740
seems to be the disciple

297
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,580
of Nonuple Palace.

298
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,780
It's quite suspicious.

299
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,260
I've already sent

300
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,740
people to

301
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,940
conduct investigation.

302
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,700
But

303
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,060
there's one more important thing

304
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,060
to discuss

305
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,780
since you're all here.

306
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,420
Host Jing Yuan, are you talking about

307
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,140
the Battle of martial arts by the lake,
which is held once every three years?

308
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:20,900
If

309
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,100
we hold it now,

310
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,820
the case of Qu Zheng

311
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,300
would be delayed.

312
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,380
But for now, Qu Zheng

313
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,580
has made up his mind to

314
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,540
lock himself inside.

315
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,740
Are we going to delay the

316
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,940
Battle of martial arts by the lake,
the most important event in

317
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,260
just because of him?

318
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,780
In this case,

319
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,460
I consider it's better

320
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,900
to be held

321
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,740
by the Nonuple Palace.

322
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,060
What?

323
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,260
Are you saying that everything was

324
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,220
arranged by Lord Qu

325
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,820
since we began to escort the Canon?

326
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,180
So is it also him

327
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,260
framed up Jin's Escort Agency?

328
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,100
It's impossible.

329
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,500
He's not such a person at all.

330
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,300
He admitted it himself.

331
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,420
What?

332
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,380
But Tingqin Garden

333
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,380
is guarded strictly now.

334
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,100
There's no way for us to get out.

335
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,740
I've known him for two years.

336
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,100
He is by no means

337
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,260
a vicious person.

338
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,140
Well,

339
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,620
I gotta ask him to his face.

340
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,460
Zhuozhuo

341
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,340
Qu Zheng

342
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,580
Make it clear to me.

343
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,380
What the hell is going on?

344
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,140
My goodness.

345
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,420
Don't make it worse.

346
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,460
Get out of my way.

347
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,460
He owes me

348
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,260
an explanation.

349
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,140
Zheng is

350
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,860
not here.

351
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,180
Then you tell me.

352
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,580
What happened exactly.

353
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,660
Baiwan said that

354
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,340
Qu Zheng asked them to escort the Canon.

355
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,860
Is it true?

356
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,820
I told you it's too

357
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
complicated to be explained clearly

358
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,180
in a few words.

359
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,460
So you admit it.

360
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,380
Brother Shu was right.

361
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,860
You are the bad guys.

362
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,140
I told you

363
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,100
it's not as simple

364
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,180
as you think.

365
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,300
Right.

366
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,180
My only mistake is that

367
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,380
I thought it too simple

368
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
at the beginning.

369
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,140
Now everything is clear.

370
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,340
Zhuozhuo, Miss Muqiu

371
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,460
Let's go now.

372
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,860
Go?

373
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,220
Where are you going?

374
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,700
Of course to leave here.

375
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,980
Right.

376
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,860
You are all scumbags, you and Qu Zheng.

377
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,500
We Yan School won't let you off so easily.

378
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,819
Let's go pack.

379
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,300
What the hell?

380
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,339
Miss Jin

381
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,579
It's too dangerous outside.

382
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,540
Zheng won't let you go.

383
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,579
It's for you own good.

384
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,819
Don't be ridiculous.

385
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,980
For now, Tingqin Garden is the most

386
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,060
dangerous place for us.

387
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,579
Right.

388
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,540
He's just afraid that

389
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,900
we'd make his schemes

390
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,180
known to the public.

391
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,740
What does he want?

392
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,700
Well...

393
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,260
What I want is simple.

394
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,940
You

395
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,340
stay here.

396
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,820
How dare you come out here?

397
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
Let's give them

398
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,540
some minutes.

399
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,900
Let's go.

400
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,860
Get your hands off me.

401
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Let me go.

402
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,580
You can't cage me

403
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,900
if I'm determined to go.

404
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,500
So what would you do

405
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,260
if I determined not to let you go?

406
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,220
How dare you.

407
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,620
If I'm gonna lose you forever,

408
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,380
I dare do everything.

409
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,540
Don't put on an act.

410
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,420
Stop acting.

411
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,740
I said

412
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,180
I would never believe you again.

413
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
But I don't believe it.

414
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,660
I don't believe you can forget me

415
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,900
completely from your heart.

416
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,820
Even if I schemed against the world,

417
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,980
even if I am the

418
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,300
bad guy you are talking,

419
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,380
could this wipe out

420
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
all these affections

421
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,700
between us?

422
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,900
You are not qualified

423
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,060
to talk about affection.

424
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,380
But I bet

425
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
you are not able to

426
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,660
get over with me.

427
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I bet you

428
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,460
can't forget our past.

429
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,620
Are you really going to walk away from me?

430
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,940
Yes.

431
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,380
You're right.

432
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,660
I shouldn't have

433
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,700
taken chances to you.

434
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,420
I should have thought that

435
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,860
you are such a person.

436
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,340
What's funny is that

437
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,340
I've always thought

438
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,660
this Peach blossom Hairpin

439
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,300
proves your love

440
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,700
and your feelings to me.

441
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,900
I have been such a fool.

442
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,220
It represents that

443
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,260
there's nothing

444
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,780
left between us.

445
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,460
Because people like you

446
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,940
don't deserve love.

447
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,740
Baiwan

448
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,340
I prevent you leaving because

449
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,180
I'm afraid that I can't protect you well

450
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,700
outside Tingqin Garden.

451
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,740
I'm afraid that

452
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,100
I'd lose you again.

453
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,060
You can blame me as you want.

454
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,740
But I can't stand

455
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,740
your distrust.

456
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,540
Baiwan

457
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,540
I've check it out.

458
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,220
The whole Tingqin Garden has

459
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,860
been guarded strictly.

460
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm afraid it's true

461
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,660
that Qu Zheng is determined

462
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,500
to trap us here.

463
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,940
Don't worry.

464
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,780
He won't get his wish.

465
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,180
But

466
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,540
I just eavesdropped that

467
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,380
the Battle of martial arts by the lake

468
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,540
is around the corner.

469
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,580
As the winner of the

470
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,860
last battle,

471
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,140
he might attend it this time.

472
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,100
I think

473
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,460
it is a good chance

474
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,220
for us

475
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
to get out.

476
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,140
Mrs

477
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,220
Sorry to get you into troubles.

478
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,180
Stop saying

479
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,780
such words.

480
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,340
I got a great...

481
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,860
good news.

482
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,780
What good news

483
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,980
at this time?

484
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,700
Although Qu Zheng has blocked

485
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,180
all the exits

486
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,860
and won't let us send any letters.

487
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,740
But what he hasn't expected is that

488
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,460
the carrier pigeon I sent before

489
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,420
has come back.

490
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,500
What's on it?

491
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,340
I'm always curious that

492
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,460
why Baiwan's loss of memory

493
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,540
can't be cured.

494
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,580
So I sent the carrier pigeon

495
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,460
to my father and

496
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,140
told him all your symptoms.

497
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,660
Guess what?

498
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,340
Don't keep us guessing.

499
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,500
Baiwan's memory has not

500
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,460
been lost at all.

501
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,780
What?

502
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,260
Give me your hand.

503
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,100
The mark on her hand

504
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,500
proves that her memory

505
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,340
has been sealed.

506
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,260
Sealed?

507
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,780
But didn't

508
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,380
you say it's

509
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,820
the mark of

510
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,460
Envoy Xueyue?

511
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,420
This is done

512
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,060
by a special spell,

513
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,180
which not only sealed your memory

514
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,260
but also your martial arts.

515
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,300
He also said that

516
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,940
only the precious

517
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,780
Lingyao Herb

518
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,340
can unseal it.

519
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,900
Lingyao Herb?

520
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,180
I just asked

521
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,260
the disciples in Tingqin Garden.

522
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,980
They said the winner's prize of this

523
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,260
Battle of martial arts by the lake

524
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,380
is Lingyao Herb.

525
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,540
For real?

526
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,500
They just said so.

527
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,620
That's great.

528
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,180
As long as we get the Lingyao Herb,

529
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,060
you can remember everything then.

530
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,980
By that time,

531
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,260
you'd be the eldest disciple

532
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,980
of Nonuple Palace.

533
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,940
What's there to fear

534
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,180
that insidious Qu Zheng?

535
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,700
How could we attend it

536
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,620
when we're still stuck here?

537
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,220
I must get out of here.

538
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,140
I must get Lingyao Herb.

539
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,580
Zheng

540
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,100
Just now Miss Jin

541
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,180
badgered to leave again.

542
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,060
And she even fought with

543
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,940
two guards.

544
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,460
But she's okay,

545
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,580
I assure you.

546
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,980
Only

547
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,620
one of our disciples

548
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,860
got slightly hurt.

549
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,460
As long as they're fine.

550
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,740
Never allow them to leave Tingqin Garden

551
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,540
even at the risk of

552
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,780
more injuries.

553
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,660
Zheng

554
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,420
Are you out of your senses?

555
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,780
You don't care about the injuries and deaths
of our disciples.

556
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,180
Don't you really want to

557
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,780
cage Miss Jin here forever?

558
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,860
So what?

559
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,260
I'd give anything to keep her,

560
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,420
to keep her

561
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,300
by my side.

562
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,580
Look at you now.

563
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
I wish to stay away from you,

564
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,380
let alone Miss Jin.

565
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,900
You're gone too far.

566
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,300
I did nothing wrong.

567
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,580
Nothing wrong?

568
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,460
Put the present aside.

569
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,580
You hid everything from her

570
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,060
from the very beginning.

571
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,380
She knew nothing about
what happened five years ago,

572
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,340
what Jing Yuan had done,

573
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,100
and what her true identity is.

574
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,780
Why don't you hide her from the truth?

575
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,940
What's more,

576
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,820
she knows it now.

577
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,700
Why can't you just

578
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,940
explain everything to her?

579
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,540
She can't

580
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,380
know the past.

581
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,180
I know.

582
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,460
If she ever finds

583
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,540
out her past,

584
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,500
finds out that she had been

585
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,940
deceived by Jing Yuan,

586
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,340
she will feel painful.

587
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,460
She will feel bad.

588
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,660
But that's who she is, isn't it?

589
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,700
Even though you're her husband,

590
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,580
you have no right

591
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,740
to control her life.

592
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,140
What's the difference

593
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,100
between you and Jing Yuan

594
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,940
if you keep

595
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,740
manipulating her like this?

596
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,180
I never intend to manipulate her.

597
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,100
Then why didn't you tell her everything?

598
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,500
She's lost faith in me.

599
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,180
Do you really expect her to believe me

600
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,460
even if I tell her the truth?

601
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,900
Believe you or not, it's her choice.

602
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,900
And you need to respect it.

603
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,140
Now that she determines to

604
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,420
get back her past,

605
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,220
there's no way you can stop her.

606
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,820
What a beautiful wedding dress.

607
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,540
Right.

608
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,420
Mrs Qu

609
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,500
Mrs Qu

610
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,460
What's that?

611
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,540
Madam,

612
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,700
there's nothing here.

613
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,100
We need to get back to work.

614
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,220
Go.

615
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,100
Mrs Muqiu's wedding dress

616
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,300
looked so beautiful on her.

617
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,660
Don't worry, my lady.

618
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,500
Your dress would be much prettier

619
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,420
than hers

620
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,620
on our wedding day.

621
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Don't get me wrong.

622
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,180
I've already made an order

623
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,260
to put this wedding dress away.

624
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,340
It's never tainted with

625
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,220
any schemes.

626
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,780
So what?

627
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,220
It's not supposed to exist.

628
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
You and I made a big mistake

629
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,540
from the very beginning.

630
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,860
I was not supposed to be here

631
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,340
at the beginning.

632
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,500
I know

633
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,220
you wanna leave here

634
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,060
since you heard about the

635
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Battle of martial arts by the lake.

636
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,540
It's a mistake.

637
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,420
And it's time to

638
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,060
break off our engagement.

639
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,820
The longer you cage me here,

640
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,220
the more I hate you.

641
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,100
Okay.

642
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,540
I promise you.

643
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,140
You can leave now.

644
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
What's the point to keep you here if I can't win your heart?

645
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,580
The one who brought up the engagement was you,

646
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,540
and the one who break it off

647
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,340
is still you.

648
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,740
The vows

649
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,900
got broken so easily.

650
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,820
You are the one

651
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,660
who plays with affections

652
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,220
and breaks vows.

653
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,980
It's the thought that counts.

654
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,700
Hopefully you will treasure

655
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,260
this hairpin as

656
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,540
you treasure

657
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
your fox pendant.

658
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,940
Jianshan

659
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,180
What would you do

660
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,300
if you were in my shoes?

661
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,540
Would you let her go?

662
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,220
You used to

663
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,300
fulfill wishes for her

664
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,380
right?

665
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,060
For now,

666
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,820
this is exactly her wish.

667
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,700
I suppose you know

668
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,060
it clearly what to do.

669
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,500
Baiwan

670
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,380
Let me be with you

671
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,420
since you insist to get back your memory.

672
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,820
No matter you can

673
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,180
bear the result or not,

674
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,300
I'll be your side

675
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
and make it through with you.

676
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,460
The maze disappeared.

677
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,380
Are they really gonna let us go?

678
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
These bast*rds.

679
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,420
Don't they dare

680
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,140
cage us longer.

681
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,260
Wait.

682
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,260
It's gonna be

683
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,100
rain.

684
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,300
Qiuer

685
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,540
You said we are free to go.

686
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,860
Don't go back on your words.

687
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,540
Relax.

688
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm here just to remind you of

689
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,140
Lord Qu's words.

690
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,260
You can leave

691
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,420
here only on the condition that

692
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,140
you must keep your mouth shut

693
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,780
about what you heard

694
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,780
in Tingqin Garden.

695
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
Don't you forget it.

696
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,260
I, Su Zhuozhuo,

697
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,500
would never bow my head to

698
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,780
Tingqin Garden but for their safety.

699
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,540
Right.

700
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,620
Please remember that

701
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,940
Tingqin Garden

702
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,780
has countless ways

703
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,860
to punish

704
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,100
the defaulters.

705
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,140
I dare you.

706
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,460
Right, I don't dare.

707
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,660
But it's not said by me.

708
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,780
Don't get mad at me.

709
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,860
I will do as I promised.

710
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,260
I'm always

711
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
keeping my words

712
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,340
otherwise I won't say it.

713
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Right.

714
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
We'll stick to our words.

715
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,660
Go tell your Lord

716
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,380
never to bother

717
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,940
Baiwan again.

718
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,220
Don't worry.

719
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,100
That shameless wretch

720
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,860
would be ashamed

721
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,740
to see us.

722
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,340
You are still here, Baiwan.

723
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
Do you regret to leave?

724
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,220
If you do,

725
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,700
the door of Tingqin Garden

726
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,140
is still open for you.

727
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,540
You'd better behave yourself.

728
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,620
Do you get it now?

729
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,820
You're right.

730
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,660
I was wrong.

731
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,980
If she wants to

732
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,180
find her past,

733
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
I shouldn't stop her.

734
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,100
Not to mention keep her

735
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,180
if she wants to go.

736
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,580
Then

737
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,380
what do we do now?

738
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,500
Get packed and head for

739
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,340
the Battle of martial arts by the lake.

740
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,340
The winner's prize is Lingyao Herb.

741
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,380
You think

742
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,780
it's for Baiwan

743
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,180
or me?

744
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,420
You're going to get Lingyao Herb for her.

745
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,980
But it's

746
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,540
an absolute trap.

747
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Are we really going to be there?

748
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,660
How can I see her go there alone

749
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,260
when I know clearly
there's a trap waiting for her?
