[Fall in Love with a Fox]
[EP16]

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,580
Scouts already checked it.

4
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,660
All the people from Nonuple Palace

5
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,500
had left.

6
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,220
It's said Jing Yuan

7
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,100
used Nonuple Token

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,180
to call them back.

9
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,740
It seems that

10
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,740
we can

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,020
catch our breath for a while.

12
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:51,700
No.

13
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,979
Somehow, I think

14
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,620
he may smell something.

15
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,700
What?

16
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,900
I was with Jin Baiwan

17
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,660
all the way.

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,660
If Nonuple Palace's people

19
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,740
found some points,

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,060
it wouldn't be surprising.

21
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,979
Fortunately,

22
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,060
I know

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,900
who she was.

24
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,980
Right.

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,820
No one would know

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,740
Miss Jin

27
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
was from Nonuple Palace.

28
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,540
Baiwan lost her memory now,

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,740
so I can't let her

30
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,740
be in Jing Yuan's hands.

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,140
So,

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,980
what's the next step?

33
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,860
Hold a wedding ceremony.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,620
As long as Baiwan gets married with me,

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,460
she will officially become

36
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,300
Mrs. Qu of Tingqin Garden.

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,380
Even Nonuple Palace

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,620
can't do anything bad to her.

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,420
Getting married with her?

40
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,260
Are you serious?

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
Will she agree on that?

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,180
You go ask Mr Wang

43
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,460
to have all the wedding things

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,140
well prepared.

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,460
When the time is right,

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,100
I'll tell her.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,740
Okay.

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,220
By the way,

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,380
I disclosed your birthday

50
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,180
to her accidentally.

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,100
Accidentally?

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,260
So,

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,460
I guess Miss Jin

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,820
may be busy with

55
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,140
your birthday gifts now.

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,540
You're welcome.

57
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,100
Well,

58
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,980
that's all right.

59
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,260
Birthday?

60
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,020
Close your mouth,

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,820
or you'll get wrinkles.

62
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,540
Birthday?

63
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,700
Zheng didn't want to tell me his birthday.

64
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,700
If Song Jianshan didn't let it slip,

65
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,780
I wouldn't know it.

66
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,620
Does it work?

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,860
That's the face cream

68
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,300
with Zhuozhuo's secret-recipe.

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,740
It can make you

70
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,340
not age a day.

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,460
Nice.

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,820
Baiwan

73
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,380
You plan to

74
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,380
hold a wonderful birthday party for Lord Qu,

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,420
right?

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,020
He offended so many people

77
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,260
because of me.

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,540
He can't invite more guests anymore,

79
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,740
but

80
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,140
I have an idea.

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,620
I tell you...

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,900
That's amazing!

83
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,340
What do you think of it?

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,700
You've done a lot for his birthday.

85
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,380
It's worth that I voluntarily

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,100
give him up to you.

87
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,140
You give him to me?

88
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,980
Yes, of course?

89
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,500
You...

90
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,940
We three

91
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,220
are best sisters.

92
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,820
We shouldn't argue for a man.

93
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,540
It's not worth it.

94
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,780
Sisters? No way.

95
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,700
Zheng

96
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,980
The wedding dresses are prepared.

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
You can go have a check if you have a minute.

98
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,620
Okay.

99
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Be careful with that.

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,060
Make sure Baiwan can't know anything.

101
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,980
You can count on me.

102
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,100
What are you talking about?

103
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,020
Nothing.

104
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,260
Zheng is teaching me

105
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,220
how to write well.

106
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,260
Writing?

107
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,420
But why do you look suspicious?

108
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,060
Baiwan

109
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,540
What brings you here?

110
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,060
I heard all the people outside had gone away.

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,980
There will be a temple fair tomorrow night.

112
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,860
So you want to go out, Baiwan?

113
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,180
Can I?

114
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,580
Of course, if you like.

115
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,420
Really?

116
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,740
Then we have a deal.

117
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,220
We'll enjoy it tomorrow night.

118
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,140
Deal.

119
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,380
Sorry, sir.

120
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,260
It's closing time.

121
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,860
Come back tomorrow, please.

122
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,180
Closing time?

123
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,980
Mercy, please.

124
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,300
Take whatever you want.

125
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,260
The cash...

126
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,420
Cash is on the counter.

127
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,140
Young Host of Palace

128
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,340
I have checked this out.

129
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,500
This food shop is the biggest one

130
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,580
in Qingyi Town.

131
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Well, sort of.

132
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,220
Tingqin Garden

133
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
is an influential family there.

134
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,420
And they usually purchase food there,

135
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,460
right?

136
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,380
Yeah.

137
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,620
A butler of Tingqin Garden

138
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,660
purchases food and basic goods

139
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,180
every five days.

140
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
He actually purchases food

141
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,060
from here.

142
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,180
When will he come here

143
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,180
next time?

144
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,060
He...

145
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,620
Today.

146
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,180
It's today.

147
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,060
He will disguise himself as an antique shop owner, named Wang.

148
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,420
Mr Xu

149
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,260
Our shopkeeper went out to visit relatives.

150
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,540
Just ask me if you have any needs.

151
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,380
I'm the owner of antique shop, Wang.

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,700
The shopkeeper must tell you I would be here, right?

153
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,980
Yes, sir. He told me about it.

154
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,140
The usual, sir?

155
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,659
Yeah, but 30 percent more food and oil than before.

156
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,420
You also sell

157
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,260
red dates, longans,

158
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,020
lotus seeds and something like that, right?

159
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,659
Yes, sir.

160
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,180
I'll have five kilograms each.

161
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,900
-Okay.
-By the way.

162
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,580
Who is the best jewelry artisan

163
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,260
in this town?

164
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,820
Well, you need peanuts, red dates,

165
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,980
and jewelry,

166
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,460
does your family have a happy event?

167
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,020
It's just a normal wedding,

168
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,980
nothing special.

169
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,220
I got to go

170
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,500
and take all the staffs later.

171
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,420
Who'll get married?

172
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,740
It must be Chu, right?

173
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,820
I don't know any Chu.

174
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,940
Tell me,

175
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,540
will Chu

176
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,740
get married with Qu Zheng from Tingqin Garden?

177
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,260
It seems that

178
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,980
you want to do something bad to Tingqin Garden.

179
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,340
I won't tell you a word.

180
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,100
Bring me to Tingqin Garden,

181
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,620
or I'll kill you.

182
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,740
Each one from Tingqin Garden

183
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,620
is not a coward.

184
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,660
Young Host of Palace

185
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,060
So...

186
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,140
Wedding...

187
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,659
Amazing!

188
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,580
Wonderful!

189
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,620
Cool! Another show!

190
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,420
Thank you.

191
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,020
Thank you.

192
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,580
That's so cool!

193
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,940
How are the preparations going?

194
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,100
I'm Su Zhuozhuo.

195
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,900
You can count on me.

196
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,780
It's the last thing he'll expect.

197
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,300
He's not gonna expect

198
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,940
you can have such a big surprise

199
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,860
for him.

200
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Keep your voice down, Baiwan.

201
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,020
Don't you want to visit temple fair?

202
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,220
The fair is there.

203
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm not here

204
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,260
for the temple fair.

205
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,500
Then what's it about?

206
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,260
Well...

207
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,340
I have a surprise for you.

208
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,580
A surprise?

209
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,020
What is it?

210
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,140
Close your eyes, and turn around.

211
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,540
I'll take you to there.

212
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,740
What are you doing?

213
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
It's none of your business.

214
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,620
Let's go.

215
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,940
We're friends.

216
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,340
Why don't you tell me about it?

217
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
Go report to Young Host of Palace.

218
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,740
We found Jin Baiwan.

219
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,620
Yes, sir.

220
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,820
Young Master of Valley

221
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,900
We buy the novels

222
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,860
written by Young Mrs. every day.

223
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,060
Does it work?

224
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,860
Qiuer is trapped in Tingqin Garden.

225
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,500
The novel is the only way

226
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,500
that she can deliver messages.

227
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,260
There must be some secrets

228
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,340
in these novels.

229
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,820
Excuse me.

230
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,060
Is there the Barefaced...

231
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,740
I mean by Qiu Qiuer?

232
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,060
You mean Barefaced Yu Lingfeng, right?

233
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,780
There it is.

234
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,980
I'll get it for you.

235
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,380
Thank you.

236
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,180
That's weird.

237
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,860
I think

238
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,540
you just love reading novels.

239
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,940
Nonsense.

240
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,060
How could I love reading that vul...

241
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,260
Vul...

242
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,780
Look at you.

243
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,340
You don't even use the word "vulgar"now.

244
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,220
Well, I can't say it's vulgar.

245
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,460
And it's easy to read,

246
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,500
appealing to all social groups.

247
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,780
Qiuer

248
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,700
Young Master of Valley

249
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,380
Qiuer

250
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,780
Young Mrs can't be there.

251
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,300
It's impossible.

252
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,300
It must be Qiuer.

253
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,220
Go find her.

254
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:21,980
Zheng

255
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Open your eyes.

256
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,980
I know

257
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,140
today is your birthday,

258
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,300
so I

259
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,020
have a surprise for you.

260
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,780
It's the first time I've celebrated the birthday for you.

261
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,780
I missed those 24 birthdays before.

262
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,220
So tonight,

263
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,340
I'll make it up.

264
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,460
That's the gift

265
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,700
for your one-year-old birthday.

266
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,780
Though a lot of things

267
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,980
had happened in the world

268
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
on that day,

269
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,980
the most important thing for me

270
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,380
was your birth.

271
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,660
Because...

272
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,940
You're a beam of light of my life.

273
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,580
I should've said that

274
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,540
to you.

275
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,620
Well, let me finish.

276
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,260
That's for your two-year-old birthday.

277
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,500
It's sweet.

278
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,900
Kids love candies.

279
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,420
But you can't eat too much,

280
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,900
or it'll rot your teeth out.

281
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,740
Then

282
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,540
you couldn't eat meals cooked by me.

283
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,940
I must have the meals made by you

284
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,620
forever.

285
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,620
When you were three years old,

286
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,100
you must know how to write.

287
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,220
All these Ink brushes are for you.

288
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,660
So you can record

289
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,340
all the moments with me.

290
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
When you were four years old,

291
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,580
you must begin to learn how to use a sword.

292
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,140
Because you would travel all over the world

293
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,140
with me 21 years later,

294
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,620
taking a sword.

295
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,820
You didn't expect

296
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,940
you could meet me, right?

297
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,980
Before that,

298
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,620
it's you who take care of me,

299
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,180
and keep me safe.

300
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
And I want to do the same to you,

301
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,700
taking care of you

302
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,460
and keeping you safe.

303
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,380
I'll give you everything best.

304
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,020
If you can always

305
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,140
be with me,

306
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,580
it'll be everything

307
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
for me.

308
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,620
I will.

309
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,260
Let's see other gifts for you.

310
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,380
Okay.

311
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,620
Oh no.

312
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,860
Why there are only

313
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,140
24 gifts?

314
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,940
I left

315
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,780
the most important one.

316
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,100
You have prepared so many gifts for me.

317
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
That's enough.

318
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,900
No.

319
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,500
That's the most important one.

320
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,980
Stay here. I'll take it for you.

321
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,220
Baiwan

322
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,780
The streets are not safe.

323
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,020
Let me

324
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,460
go with you?

325
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,180
No.

326
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,580
It's over there. It's close.

327
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,260
That's a surprise for you,

328
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,620
so I won't let you know what it is.

329
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
I'll be right back.

330
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,460
Okay.

331
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,700
I'll be there.

332
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,740
Okay.

333
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,220
Why did I never meet someone

334
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,980
like him?

335
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,300
Was you afraid of seeing

336
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,020
them showing PDA?

337
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,020
But you're alone,

338
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,460
so you left there, right?

339
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,740
I make up my mind

340
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,380
to be a single lady.

341
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,099
Nobody needs you,

342
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,060
so you're a real bachelor.

343
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,339
Nobody needs me?

344
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,980
If I'm not afraid a relationship

345
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,180
can influence my adventure,

346
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,300
numerous matchmakers

347
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,700
will come to Tingqin Garden.

348
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,260
You know?

349
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,099
Crap!

350
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,020
Well,

351
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
you want to get some shots today.

352
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,980
Wait and see

353
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,140
who will get shots among us.

354
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,859
You're good, huh?

355
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,660
Yeah?

356
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:27,900
Well...

357
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm stuck by a plot

358
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,260
in my new novel.

359
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,620
Help me figure out how to write it.

360
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,780
You mean

361
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,500
the unfinished chapter of

362
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,740
Innocent Escort And Pretty Robber.

363
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,540
I think

364
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,900
it should end with

365
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,140
flower rain.

366
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,220
How romantic it is!

367
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,020
Flower rain?

368
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,820
That's old school!

369
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,420
So corny.

370
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,740
You know sh*t.

371
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,700
Flower rain is so beautiful.

372
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,900
Muqiu

373
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,660
I have an idea.

374
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,620
At the end,

375
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,380
the two people can climb into

376
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,260
a huge sky lantern,

377
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
overlooking a flower field

378
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,020
covered the ground

379
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,060
when they're flying to the sky.

380
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,740
How about that?

381
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,940
Qiuqiu

382
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,660
Just make a choice.

383
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,660
Right.

384
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,580
Muqiu

385
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,100
Just make your choice.

386
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,540
I... I will think about it both.

387
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,460
Well...

388
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,900
I...

389
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,180
You must be thirsty.

390
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,700
Let's have some drink. I'm buying.

391
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,540
You are not worth

392
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,180
my breath or time.

393
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,740
Excuse me.

394
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,420
One bowl of sugar cane juice.

395
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,660
I'll have one, too.

396
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,780
Sorry.

397
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,540
There is one left.

398
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,140
Qiuqiu

399
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,340
Give us a minute.

400
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,300
Okay. I'll leave.

401
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,540
Qi?

402
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,500
What are you doing?

403
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,660
I want to take you someplace.

404
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,780
Keep my hands off!

405
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,700
My husband is waiting for me.

406
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,340
What husband?

407
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,380
Don't let Qu Zheng fool you.

408
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,340
He is a liar.

409
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,380
I'm the one

410
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,140
you can trust.

411
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,660
Leave me alone!

412
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:17,900
Let's go.

413
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,740
What're you doing?

414
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,940
Why did you have to fight me for the juice?

415
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,980
Nobody got that,

416
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,020
and we paid for a broken bowl.

417
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,100
I drank it.

418
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,300
I got the last sip.

419
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,980
I...

420
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,140
It's so sweet.

421
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,100
Where's Baiwan?

422
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,220
Lord

423
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,620
Lord

424
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,180
Lord

425
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,340
Something happened to your wife.

426
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,100
What?

427
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,380
She was taken away

428
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,140
by the people from Nonuple Palace.

429
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,940
What?

430
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,060
Let's split up.

431
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,620
Okay.

432
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,900
What're you doing?

433
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,220
Go get Baiwan!

434
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,740
No.

435
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,820
You have to take the news to Tingqin Garden,

436
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
and bring more people here.

437
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,540
Let's split up.

438
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,060
Let's go.

439
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,220
Darling

440
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,940
That's funny.

441
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,780
I'm glad to hear that.

442
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,140
I like it.

443
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,180
Qiuer

444
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,540
Brother Shu

445
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,340
Great!

446
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,980
Qu Zheng let you go finally.

447
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,140
He did not give you a hard time, did he?

448
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I thought you left.

449
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,260
How could I?

450
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:29,900
Come on.

451
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,860
I'm gonna take you out of here.

452
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,100
I'm a guest of Tingqin Garden.

453
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,100
Baiwan and Lord Qu

454
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
promised me they would go easy on me.

455
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,020
You still speak for Qu Zheng now,

456
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,420
don't you?

457
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,780
He kidnapped you.

458
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,660
You have no idea

459
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,300
how worried your father is.

460
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Actually, Baiwan missed me...

461
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,340
I'll explain it

462
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,300
to my Dad.

463
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,860
I have to go to Baiwan now.

464
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,180
You.

465
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,620
Qiuer

466
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,820
At this point...

467
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,820
If you're mad at me,

468
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,020
you need to get over it.

469
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,900
Right.

470
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,100
It was you who made a such a big trouble

471
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,460
in Taoyuan Valley.

472
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,860
We've found you, finally.

473
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,900
Don't you want to escape from us?

474
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,460
-You
-Jueming

475
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,620
Wait.

476
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,740
This is Baiwan's stuff.

477
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,300
Why is it here?

478
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,620
What're you doing here?

479
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,540
Qiuqiu

480
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,660
Something happened to Baiwan.

481
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,660
What?

482
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,220
I will say it again.

483
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,100
Stop.

484
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,380
You still want to go back to him?

485
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,260
He's my husband.

486
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,100
You heard me?

487
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,220
I did that for your own good.

488
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,060
Why do you have to

489
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,740
continue to

490
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,460
trust Qu Zheng, a creep?

491
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,380
I don't see any good that you kidnapped me on the street.

492
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,140
And you called Zheng a creep.

493
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,980
Aren't you shifting the blame?

494
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,180
From what I've seen,

495
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,980
you just want to use me

496
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
against Zheng.

497
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,380
Leave me alone.

498
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,780
I never lied to you.

499
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Do you expect me to believe what you said,

500
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,900
instead of his words?

501
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,140
What if I told you

502
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,820
everything was a trap

503
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,740
set by Qu Zheng

504
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,060
when you began to escort the sacred book.

505
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,340
Qu Zheng is the one

506
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,300
that is behind this.

507
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,420
It was him who hired you

508
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,020
to escort the fake Puyuan Canon.

509
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,660
I won't

510
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,220
fall your crap.

511
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,660
About the Bloody Moon tattoo on your hand...

512
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,980
Only the high priests in Nonuple Palace

513
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,220
can keep that.

514
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,700
The male priest is called Envoy Heiyun.

515
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,060
The female priest is called Envoy Xueyue.

516
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,860
Everyone knows about it.

517
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,500
Okay.

518
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,660
Even if I was from

519
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,700
Nonuple Palace,

520
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,660
it wouldn't have anything to do

521
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,780
with your words.

522
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,700
Five years ago,

523
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,300
you were ordered to destroy Xu's family,

524
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,220
stealing the sacred book.

525
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,580
After that, you disappeared, lost your memories.

526
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,220
Then Qu Zheng pretended to be close to you,

527
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,100
and fool you.

528
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
Think about why?

529
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,060
What are you trying to say?

530
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,020
All of these

531
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
is because he wanted to get

532
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,820
the real Puyuan Canon.

533
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,020
A person can prove my words.

534
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,300
You'll know I don't lie to you

535
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,260
if you meet her.

536
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,660
You mean Baiwan

537
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
was taken away by Young Host of Palace?

538
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,700
I have to

539
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,780
take the news to Tingqin Garden.

540
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,540
Mr Yu

541
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,260
Since you're here,

542
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,620
can you take care of Qiuqiu for me

543
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,500
and find Baiwan with her?

544
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,660
Qiuer

545
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,740
Don't worry, Qiuer.

546
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,700
Nonuple Palace

547
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,620
is a decent school.

548
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,660
They said

549
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,460
Baiwan was a disciple

550
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,860
of the palace,

551
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,540
so I think

552
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,660
they wouldn't give a hard time to her.

553
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,460
Right.

554
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,340
Then Miss Jin

555
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,220
can go back her school.

556
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,500
What are you talking about?

557
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,860
Have you ever seen a decent school

558
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,500
kidnap a woman many times?

559
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,460
For me,

560
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,300
they're bandits!

561
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,660
We just don't know the facts.

562
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,740
No one can settle

563
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,500
the dispute

564
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,500
between Nonuple Palace and Tingqin Garden.

565
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,300
That's not a dispute.

566
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,860
They kidnapped Baiwan.

567
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,060
I can't drop her.

568
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,860
I never said we could sit on our hands.

569
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,260
Well, Qiuer.

570
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,060
You go back to Taoyuan Valley with me first.

571
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,140
I'll send people to find her

572
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,420
when we arrive there.

573
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,460
It'll be too late

574
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,300
when you go back to Taoyuan Valley.

575
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,140
No one knows

576
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,980
what will happen to Baiwan.

577
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,540
I'll find her myself

578
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,620
if you don't want to help me!

579
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,660
Qiuer

580
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,620
Qiuer

581
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,060
Lord

582
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,100
It's now known

583
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,340
Mrs Qu was taken away to a wagon

584
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,060
by the Young Host of Nonuple Palace.

585
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,580
According to the tracks,

586
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,540
they headed to

587
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,820
Wanlan Town.

588
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,940
Go inform all the disciples

589
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,860
to Wanlan Town.

590
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,820
Yes, Lord.

591
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,260
Have you got Baiwan?

592
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,900
We knew they went to Wanlan Town.

593
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,940
Zheng has been on the way there.

594
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,660
I'll take the disciples to help him.

595
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,380
Wanlan Town?

596
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm coming with you.

597
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,260
Let's go.

598
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,940
Young Master of Valley

599
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,780
We're not going there, are we?

600
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,220
The most important thing

601
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,020
for Qiuer

602
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,460
is to get Baiwan back.

603
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,580
I have to help her

604
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,500
solve it,

605
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,260
or

606
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,660
she won't go back to Taoyuan Valley.

607
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,140
Yes, master.

608
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,500
Let's go.

609
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,540
Where are we?

610
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
You'll see.

611
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,300
Mrs Lord

612
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,060
You're...

613
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,220
Xiaocui

614
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,580
It was Lord and Mrs Lord that

615
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,460
let Qingyun

616
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,580
send me here, right?

617
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,540
I planned to go to Tingqin Garden

618
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,620
to repay Lord Qu

619
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,700
for saving my life.

620
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,860
Anyway,

621
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,340
I'll do anything

622
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,580
the Lord asks.

623
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,300
You were saying

624
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,300
Zheng saved your life,

625
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,100
so you went to Tingqin Garden

626
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,180
after a long journey?

627
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,380
Yes.

628
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,340
Without Lord Qu,

629
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,860
I would

630
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,820
have been killed by

631
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,180
the damned Xing Laoliu.

632
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
Xing Laoliu

633
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,780
Trust me.

634
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
All the goods escorted by our agency

635
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,500
are stored in special boxes.

636
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,340
No one can open it except the escort.

637
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,300
I'll deliver it to Yinxue Village.

638
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,660
That's good.

639
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,780
I'll leave the sacred book

640
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,340
to you then.

641
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,380
You mean

642
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,300
the man

643
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,980
with a dark mole around his mouth,

644
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,660
who lived in Jinbian Town?

645
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,700
Right.

646
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,220
How did you know him?

647
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,180
I

648
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,980
Since you're the wife of Lord,

649
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,180
I'll tell you the truth.

650
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,860
I bought you back.

651
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,700
This is not a place for free meals!

652
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,180
If you're not serious about

653
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,500
dancing and singing,

654
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:35,780
how can I sell you to brothel

655
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,380
for a good price?

656
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,180
Master

657
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,540
Your important guest is coming.

658
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,180
Just stay here!

659
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,180
Sir

660
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,300
Puyuan Canon?

661
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,060
Just send it

662
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
to Jin's Escort Agency.

663
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,340
Ask them to deliver it

664
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,340
to a man named Qing Songke.

665
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,340
And I'll

666
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
pay for that.

667
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,740
A few days later,

668
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,340
that young man

669
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,420
arrested Xing Laoliu,

670
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
helping us get out there.

671
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,340
You mean Qu Zheng gave Puyuan Canon

672
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,500
to Xing Laoliu,

673
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,100
And had him to hire Jin's Escort Agency?

674
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,580
Right.

675
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,700
Puyuan Canon

676
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,420
I think that's the name of the book.

677
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,380
No way.

678
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,940
You must have made a mistake.

679
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,700
I didn't know

680
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,420
who the young man was before.

681
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,540
Later,

682
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,580
I had been to Taoyuan Valley accidentally.

683
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,260
I found

684
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,380
that man

685
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,500
was a big shot,

686
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,900
the Lord of Tingqin Garden.

687
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,500
It was impossible that I made a mistake.

688
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,580
No.

689
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,380
I don't believe it.

690
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,140
He wouldn't lie to me.

691
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,460
You got Xiaocui

692
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,620
to set Zheng up, right?

693
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,540
You'll see

694
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,140
if you go have a check in Jinbian Town.

695
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,420
Why

696
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,100
don't you believe

697
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,180
Qu Zheng is the man

698
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,980
who behind this?

699
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,260
Okay.

700
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,060
In that case,

701
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,980
I want to hear it from him.

702
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,780
Do you think

703
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,420
I can let you

704
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,340
go back to him?

705
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,140
Leave her alone!

706
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,220
I said,

707
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,060
hands off her.

708
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,380
Who do you think you are?

709
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,740
You don't get to talk to me

710
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,580
like that.

711
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,860
Are you fine?

712
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,340
I want you to tell me

713
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,020
if you are the one

714
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,980
who asked me to deliver the sacred book.

715
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,660
So,

716
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,100
you set up the whole thing,

717
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,380
right?

718
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,860
So,

719
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,140
you've been lying to me,

720
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,660
right?

721
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,940
Baiwan

722
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,620
I can explain it to you

723
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,300
after going back to Tingqin Garden.

724
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,340
Keep my hands off!

725
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,220
Since you're the man

726
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,140
behind this,

727
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,460
there's nothing to explain.

728
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,140
Baiwan

729
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,100
Leave me alone.

730
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,220
I don't want to see your face again.

731
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,900
Go!

732
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,100
Get out of here!

733
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,380
Get out of here!

734
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,540
Just get out of here!

735
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,460
Just go!

736
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,060
Just go!

737
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,260
You can blame me

738
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,100
or hate me.

739
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,940
All I want is to keep you safe.
