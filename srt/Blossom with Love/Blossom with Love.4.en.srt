00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,520
On the third day, at night

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,110
Please use photos to express
your feelings to the girl you like

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,230
Dong Xu, the opposite-sex friend I like...

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,840
Dong Xu, use photos to
express your feelings?

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,240
Dong Xu is very troubled

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,610
Base

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,260
The locker opened

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,739
Locker?

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,780
- So cute - The locker is so captivating
JaeJae, the locker is so captivating

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,709
Confirm the space for the inner
thoughts of the young boy and young girl.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,710
Zheng Youli.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,450
Please convey your
feelings through the locker.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,040
Whose direction will the
photo of the young boy face...?

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,040
Hui Cheng is getting dressed.

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,350
Hey, why are you sweating so much?

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,790
Today, the young boy who
is dripping with sweat.
Hey, why are you sweating so much?

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,539
Today, the young boy who
is dripping with sweat.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,540
Can you see it?

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,130
He turned into a young boy who
wants to please the young girl.

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,930
Hui Cheng, hehe, this picture won't do.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,770
Without hesitation, Hui
Cheng expressed his feelings.

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,000
Stood in front of the locker

23
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,850
Chengyun, a desired opposite-sex friend?

24
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,020
Chengyun, a curious friend?

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,889
Last night

26
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,560
- I'm going to the toilet - Understood

27
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,870
Yuli, hey, a gift Chengyun, is it for me?

28
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,216
Chengyun, whose is it? Yuli, it's mine

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,520
Chengyun, is it yours? Yuli, yes

30
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,940
Yayan, it's... a gift

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Yayan, isn't she cute? With sunglasses

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,020
Chengyun, ha...

33
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,300
Follow your heart, follow your heart
Follow your heart!

34
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,706
Chengyun seems to have
been worried for a long time

35
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,530
Chengyun, who should I trust,
who do I want to understand more?

36
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,970
Chengyun, who am I really curious
about? So I've been worried for a long time

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,980
After thinking for a while, Chengyun
finally put the photo into the locker

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,310
Yayan, where did the boys
go? They suddenly disappeared

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,340
Yuri, oh I'm so curious~

40
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,659
Yuri, when can we go on a date?

41
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,406
-But I want to date the person I want -Hmm...
Yaeun, I want to date the person I want

42
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,080
Yaeun, I want to get to know them better

43
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,500
Yaeun, by doing so, I should
be able to confirm my feelings

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,090
Liran, I thought Huicheng
would be sitting down today

45
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,730
Liran, so I wanted to chat
more with Huicheng today

46
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,640
Liyuan Oh? Oh? No, it's not haha

47
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,350
It's Junrong again

48
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:54,360
Yayan It's Junrong again~ Liyuan
Junrong said, "We are indeed destined"

49
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,090
Junrong said
Yayan It's Junrong again~ Liyuan
Junrong said, "We are indeed destined"

50
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,100
Yayan It's Junrong again~ Liyuan
Junrong said, "We are indeed destined"

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,280
- We are indeed destined - This
can't be real if it continues like this
Yayan It's Junrong again~ Liyuan
Junrong said, "We are indeed destined"

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,290

53

become a couple with Junrong
Yayan It's Junrong again~ Liyuan

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000

Completely random - random

61
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,700
Yayan, but occasionally my
brother also has some charming points

62
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,276
Yuli, is it Junrong (brother)? Yayan:
Yeah, am I the only one who feels that way?

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,340
Yuli: But I think I have
a rough idea of what it is

64
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,820
Yayan: (Sister), is it because
we're the same age that it's like this?

65
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:11,840
Maybe it's because he's older than me
Yayan: (Sister), is it because
we're the same age that it's like this?

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:11,880
Maybe it's because he's older than me

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,640
Yayan, I might feel that way because he is older than me. Liyuan: Ah,
because he is your older brother? Yes, exactly. That's why I feel that way.
Maybe it's because he's older than me

68

Yayan, I might feel that way because he is older than me. Liyuan: Ah,
because he is your older brother? Yes, exactly. That's why I feel that way.

69
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,400

Yayan, I might feel that way because he is older than me. Liyuan: Ah,

Ah, because he is your older brother.

71
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,960
Yayan: I'm not sure, but occasionally I do.

72
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,080
However, after spending time together with
Junrong yesterday and today, I realized...

73
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,550
Liyuan: Because we spent time together
continuously yesterday and today.
However, after spending time together with

74
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:21,720
Liyuan: Because we spent time together
continuously yesterday and today.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Liyuan: I truly feel that he is a good person.
Youli: That's right, he is really good.

76
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,930
Hao Renjun is holding a photo.

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,890
Renjun, because I like someone more.

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,040
Renjun, I dare not actively approach.

79
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,100
Renjun, so after receiving the
photo, if she also has feelings for me.

80
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,620
Renjun, I hope she can
come closer to me first.

81
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,050
The first time expressing
his feelings to a girl.

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,410
Dong Xu came in.

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,680
Hesitated in front of
Xiumin's locker for a long time.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,230
Dongxu feels a little distant from Xiumin.

85
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,750
Dongxu is worried about what to do
if Xiumin is not interested in him.

86
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,990
Dongxu is thinking about these things...

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,200
So it seems like he can't
easily decide to post the photos.

88
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,060
Dongxu sighs...

89
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,596
Chuu, haven't you posted them?
- Haven't posted them. - Haven't posted them.

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,410
Dongxu.

91
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,910
Howl: Oh...
- Is it true? - Oh...

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,650
That's really the worst ending.

93
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,230
Conveyed the young boy's feelings.

94
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,310
Seongyun, ah, so refreshing.

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,080
Seongyun, Tuantuan, you're really cute.

96
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,100
Seongyun, my puppy at
home is a beautiful puppy~

97
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Seongyun, so adorable.

98
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,490
Huicheng, this makes my
shoulders look so narrow.

99
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,250
Huicheng, why do I look so frail?

100
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,680
Junrong, what should I do if you look weak?

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,410
Huicheng, I want to delete the
memories of yesterday at KTV.

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,080
-KTV, did you go singing? -Yes.
Dongxu, KTV? Did you go singing?

103
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,530
Liyuan, I kept staring at
Huicheng in the cinema yesterday.

104
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:34,940
Liyuan, I have been Huicheng from the
beginning. Xiumin, ah, from the beginning?

105
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,450
I have been Huicheng from the beginning.
Liyuan, I have been Huicheng from the
beginning. Xiumin, ah, from the beginning?

106
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:36,460
Liyuan, I have been Huicheng from the
beginning. Xiumin, ah, from the beginning?

107
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,290
- Ah, from the beginning, hmm.
Liyuan, I have been Huicheng from the
beginning. Xiumin, ah, from the beginning?

108
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,410
Liyuan, I have been Huicheng from the
beginning. Xiumin, ah, from the beginning?

109
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,000
Yayan, after I finished, I
kept eating popcorn and thinking.

110
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,339
Yayan, feel so lonely? Lonely~ Like this.

111
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,350
After you all left,

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,600
Liyuan is not shy in front of me.

113
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,080
Yayan, not shy? Liyuan
is not shy in front of me.

114
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,900
Xiumin seems to only be familiar
with her sister. Yayan: Hmm.

115
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,800
I want to get closer a little more.

116
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,920
Yayan, I keep talking to him constantly.

117
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,566
Yayan, but I'm afraid he might think I'm
pursuing too hard, so I dare not do that.

118
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,246
Liyuan: Afraid it's
too obvious? Yayan: Yes.

119
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,650
Yayan: But it's already shown. I gave
him the bunny keychain. Liyuan: Yeah.

120
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,480
Yayan: Why is the weather so good today?

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,365
I hope the boys will
give us something today.

122
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,050
Yayan, I hope the boys will give us
something today like a rabbit (keychain).

123
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,250
- That's right, like a rabbit.
Yayan, I hope the boys will give us
something today like a rabbit (keychain).

124
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,350

something today like a rabbit (keychain).

125

about the boy's intentions.

clothes. Ya Yan: Yeah, I have.

144
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,330
Junrong, hello.

145
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,719
Yayan, did you sleep well?

146
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,200
Yes, I fell asleep yesterday.

Yayan, I wanted to sew last night,
but I was too tired and didn't sew.

150

Yuli, is that sewn with thread?
Yes, it is. Take a look.

151
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,230
Yayan, sew everything here
together like this. Huiren: Wow!

159
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,660
Junrong: Dongxu went to
sleep at 4 in the morning.

160
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:07,950
- Why? - Why?
Junrong: Dongxu went to
sleep at 4 in the morning.

161
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,740
- Why? - Why?

162
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,049
Junrong: I fell into deep meditation.

163
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,430
- What? - What about us...

164
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,220
Junrong: Maybe I wanted
to sleep but couldn't.

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,420
Xiumin: I slept at 3 o'clock yesterday.

166
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,660
- Is that true? - Oh my god.
Xiumin: I slept at 3 o'clock yesterday.

167
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:18,720
- Is that true? - Oh my god.

168
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,950
Yayan: What's wrong with you guys?
- Is that true? - Oh my god.

169
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,210
Yayan: What's wrong with you guys?

170
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,320
Junrong, is Dongxu still in the room?

171
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,560
Yayan, what are you thinking about?

172
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,330
"What is that?"
- I brought the sheet music.

173
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,680
My thoughts are so complicated.

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,000
Xiumin, my thoughts are so
complicated, I couldn't sleep last night.
My thoughts are so complicated.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,010
Xiumin, my thoughts are so
complicated, I couldn't sleep last night.

176
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,450
"Why?" - I couldn't sleep last night.
Xiumin, my thoughts are so
complicated, I couldn't sleep last night.

177
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:43,490
"Why?" - I couldn't sleep last night.

178
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,160
Dongxu passed by Xiumin.

179
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,030
Dongxu, Huicheng.

180
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,930
Huicheng, are you here?

181
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,980
Dong Xu, what should I
do? Cheng Yun: What's wrong?

182
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,500
Dong Xu, it's so
embarrassing. Cheng Yun: Really?

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,350
Ya Yan: Let's take some photos,
shall we? Xiu Min: Just the two of us?

184
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,950
Ya Yan: Let's go, then? Xiu Min: Okay.

185
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,400
Ya Yan: Let's go out for a while.

186
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Sure, let's go.

187
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,000
Dong Xu: I'm really troubled.

188
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,250
Dong Xu: Yesterday, I...
yesterday, I wasn't in a good state.

189
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,650
Dong Xu, so... did I give her the
wrong impression about my feelings?

190
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,880
So, yesterday I...

191
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,066
Cheng Yun, did you
misunderstand Xiu Min's feelings?

192
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,249
Dong Xu, I... Cheng Yun,
did she misunderstand?

193
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,249
Yes, I...

194
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,670
Um, yes! That's it!

195
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:13,960
Yes, yes.

196
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,210
The sisters who were watching
seemed very anxious. I also know that.
Yes, yes.

197
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,080
The sisters who were watching
seemed very anxious. I also know that.

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,960
I also know.
The sisters who were watching
seemed very anxious. I also know that.

199
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,150
I also know.

200
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,300
Dong Xu, after yesterday...
it seems like I've changed.

201
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,870
Is Liyuan not here?
Chengyun is also not here.

202
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,570
What is Chengyun doing? Dongxu has
disappeared and gone somewhere else.

203
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,720
Suimin and Yayan are
inside the photo machine.

204
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,316
More than this heart.
More than the movement of this heart?
Suimin and Yayan are
inside the photo machine.

205
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:36,340
Suimin and Yayan are
inside the photo machine.

206
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,250
- This movement - is a heart shape.
Suimin and Yayan are
inside the photo machine.

207
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,566
- This movement - is a heart shape.

208
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,349
Suimin, do this movement. Yayan, okay.

209
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,910
There's also this...

210
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,730
Suimin, there's also
this. Yayan, okay, okay.

211
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,820
Yayan, where are you looking? Are you
looking at the camera? Xiumin, over here.

212
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,630
Xiumin, so cute. Yayan, let's go.

213
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,170
Xiumin, sister... With sister's
favorite, just take it like this.

214
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,980
Xiumin, sister, give a heart sign.

215
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,280
Yayan, you take one too.

216
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm writing right now.

217
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,140
It feels better like this. Just like this.

218
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,990
Please go to the base to
confirm the young boy's feelings.

219
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,980
- Dongxu is indeed here... - She ran over.
JaeJae is indeed here, Dongxu.

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
She wants to see it. She wants to see it.

221
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,889
JaeJae, Dongxu didn't put
the photo in yesterday, right?

222
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,290
- Didn't put it in. - That's right.

223
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,240
Jin Xiumin.

224
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,446
- But why doesn't he look too good?
- No, it seems like he doesn't. Chuu, but why doesn't he look too good?

225
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,050
Please

226
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,930
Zheng Lie, I think there is more than one

227
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,120
I was with Min Jian last night

228
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,700
Min Jian

229
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,280
Only one photo of Min Jian?
Just one?

230
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,570
The expression doesn't look too good, huh?
Only one photo of Min Jian?
Just one?

231
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:23,970
The expression doesn't look too good, huh?

232
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:31,420
Photos of Min Jian, Dong Xu,
and Jun Rong were given to Xiu Min

233
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,230
Xiu Min is very happy because I was chosen

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,370
Xiu Min, but the person I
care the most about is...

235
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,520
The girl will go find the boy
she cares the most about now

236
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,050
Who is JaeJae? DongXu? DongXu?

237
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,980
HOWL suddenly becomes JunRong

238
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,190
- Of course it's DongXu, what's
happening, what's happening
HOWL suddenly becomes JunRong

239
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,290
- Of course it's DongXu, what's
happening, what's happening

240
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,530
Chuu Of course it's DongXu, go find him
- Of course it's DongXu, what's
happening, what's happening

241
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,329
Chuu Of course it's DongXu, go find him

242
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,330
Go find him

243
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,299
XiuMin, what are you doing
alone? Let me help you with that

244
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,700
- What? - Let me help you with that

245
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,200
MinJian and DongXu are in the practice room

246
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,330
XiuMin, I went to the base for a while

247
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,676
Xiumin, I don't know where she is.
I've been looking for a long time.

248
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,830
JaeJae, who is she talking
to? Is it Minjian or Dongxu?

249
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Oh, come on.

250
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,190
I'm going crazy.

251
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,429
JaeJae, Xiumin, say something.

252
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,430
Please.

253
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,230
Xiumin, where are you going?

254
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,730
Here, Dongxu.

255
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,036
JaeJae, it seems like Dongxu is
getting energized in the early morning.

256
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,300
Chuu, that's great.

257
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Ga ga

258
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,326
Xiumin, where were you when
we had a date yesterday? What?

259
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,470
- Where... - During the date
Dongxu, where did you go?

260
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,260
Dongxu, I just went to the restaurant.
I ate there... Xiumin, was it delicious?

261
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,990
Dongxu, don't I like to eat lettuce?

262
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,790
Xiumin, you really love to eat

263
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,270
Dongxu, I ate a lot.

264
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
Xiumin, I went for a walk yesterday.
Dongxu, a walk? Where did you go?

265
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,720
Xiumin, do you want to see?

266
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,080
The day before yesterday,
Minjian and Xiumin went out.

267
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,720
Do you have someone you're interested in?
The day before yesterday,
Minjian and Xiumin went out.

268
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,140
The day before yesterday,
Minjian and Xiumin went out.

269
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Yes.

270
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,760
Xiumin, should I say I have a
crush? I have that kind of brother.

271
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,030
Xiumin, I'm so shy. Minjian, I see...

272
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,119
Chuu, it's like Minjian doesn't exist now.

273
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,670
Exactly.

274
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,820
JaeJae doesn't seem to be
listening to anything, huh?

275
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,450
民建, I want to go to the restroom.

276
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,780
民建, I'll be back in a moment.

277
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,720
民建, I was listening to music, but I heard

278
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,870
民建, So in order to make
them feel more at ease,

279
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,740
民建 temporarily avoided the situation.

280
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,790
民建 temporarily avoided the situation.

281
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,990
Xiumin: I heard you didn't
sleep well last night. Dongxu: Me?

282
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:14,780
Dongxu: Your mood yesterday... seemed unhappy
because of me, so I was thinking a lot too.

283
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,100
Dongxu: "Did I do something wrong at the
arcade?" Is that what you were thinking?

284
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:30,040
Xiumin: But maybe I was too
sensitive yesterday. Dongxu: Me too.

285
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,460
Xiumin: Even if I'm angry,
I won't be angry with you.

286
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,010
Xiumin, and I wasn't angry yesterday,
just... had a lot of thoughts.

287
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,270
I always feel a bit
uncomfortable in my heart.

288
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,820
Dongxu, anyway, if you're not
by my side, I'll feel uneasy.

289
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,226
Oh my, oh my, oh my, what's going on?

290
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,680
Oh my, that's great.

291
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,040
JaeJae, he likes Xiumin x2.

292
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:26,490
Dongxu, as long as I'm separated from
you, I will unconsciously feel jealous.

293
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,080
Dongxu, to be honest, I feel a bit jealous.

294
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,900
How about you, Dongxu?

295
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,610
Xiumin, yesterday...

296
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,610
Xiumin, I had a lot
of complicated thoughts.

297
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,290
Xiumin, so I called Yayan to
chat with her here yesterday.

298
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,220
Xiumin, and suddenly I cried.

299
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,140
Dongxu, who? Xiumin, me.

300
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,760
Xiumin, that's why I
didn't sleep well yesterday.

301
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,370
Dongxu, why did you cry?

302
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,700
Xiumin, why do you think I'm crying?

303
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,680
Dongxu, why?

304
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,790
Xiumin, you should know why,
right? Didn't you also anticipate it?

305
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,930
Dongxu, I don't know why I did that now.

306
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,209
Xiumin, from the moment the newcomer came
in... I started feeling that kind of emotion.

307
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,210
Who, me?

308
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,740
Xiumin, should I say it's
jealousy? Those thoughts...

309
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,060
Yesterday, both of us had the same
feelings. Both of us have the same feelings.

310
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,800
Dongxu, ah.

311
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,180
Chuu, is this the lyrics?

312
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
JaeJae, Dongxu, you have
accomplished something big.

313
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
What should we do?

314
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,310
Dongxu, I originally wanted
to focus on making new friends.

315
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,180
Dongxu, my feelings are
still searching for you.

316
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,210
Liyuan, what sound is that?
Junrong, I feel a bit excited.

317
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,670
Liyuan is so envious of
sweetness and happiness.

318
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,470
Dongxu, let's not...
let's not become awkward.

319
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,900
Dongxu, the weather is pretty good today.

320
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,210
Dongxu, have you ever swam in the ocean?

321
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,890
Dongxu, you haven't tried it? Xiumin: Mm.

322
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,850
Dongxu, I hope we can have
a chance to go together.

323
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,610
Xiumin: Are you talking
about swimming together?

324
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,580
Dongxu, don't you think it would be
fun? You're really good at swimming.

325
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,100
Xiumin, it seems like you're
not good at swimming next to me.

326
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,090
Where did Xiumin go?

327
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,070
Dongxu said he went to the restroom.
Why hasn't he come back for so long?

328
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,710
Minjian hasn't returned.

329
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,470
Youli, I'm very curious
about the music you make.

330
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,256
Minjian was just in the middle of
making it... Youli, is it finished?

331
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,100
Minjian said the atmosphere
between them was good, so he came out.

332
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,780
Youli, what's wrong? Just stay here.

333
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,020
Minjian, look, they're still there.

334
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,370
Minjian, hi.

335
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,550
Minjian, wow, what's this?

336
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,690
Huicheng, it seems like they're
doing something in the model.

337
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,456
Huicheng, Sister must know how to do these.

338
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,590
Liyuan, it feels like... a candle?

339
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,560
Huicheng, it's a tulip filled with colored
sand. Minjian, sand painting candle.

340
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,100
Liyuan, it smells really good, huh?

341
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,760
Liyuan, you have a bit
of your scent on you.

342
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Really?

343
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,810
Huicheng, this is my perfume scent.

344
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,660
What should we do about Minjian?
What should we, Minjian, do...

345
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,996
- Minjian...
- I dare not look at Minjian anymore.

346
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,980
Why is Minjian there again?

347
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,990
Huicheng, this is my perfume scent.

348
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,430
Liyuan, the scent is very similar.

349
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,770
Didn't you spray perfume?

350
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,346
The day when Huicheng and Liyuan met for the first
time. Didn't spray perfume, used hand cream instead.

351
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,010
Huicheng: Can you smell it? Take a sniff.

352
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,600
Liyuan: Is there? Mm.

353
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:31,670
Huicheng: Does it smell good? Liyuan: It
smells a bit like fabric softener, right?
Liyuan: Is there? Mm.

354
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,366
Huicheng: Does it smell good? Liyuan: It
smells a bit like fabric softener, right?

355
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,790
Anyway, the scent is very pleasant.

356
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,146
Huicheng: The scent is very pleasant.

357
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,170
Yeah.

358
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,270
Liyuan: We can sleep well
tonight with candles lit.

359
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,280
Huicheng, now put them
all in. They are pink.

360
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
Huicheng, ah... so happy.

361
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,340
Please confirm the intentions of
the young man who arrived at the base.

362
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,280
What is this?

363
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,770
Chuu: Oh? I dare not, I dare not.

364
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,950
JaeJae: It must be difficult.
Even I dare not do it.

365
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,826
Zhenglie: Wait a moment.
I'm not mentally prepared yet.

366
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,320
JaeJae: Wait a moment. What about Li Yuan?

367
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,860
Huicheng
JaeJae: Wait a moment. What about Li Yuan?

368
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,870
JaeJae: Wait a moment. What about Li Yuan?

369
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,560
Did JaeJae give anything to Liyuan? Or not?

370
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,260
- I really can't guess
anymore - I don't know either

371
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,950
Unable to predict the teenager's intentions
Really can't guess
- I really can't guess
anymore - I don't know either

372
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,700
Unable to predict the teenager's intentions
Really can't guess

373
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,700
Liyuan is a super unexpected surprise

374
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,540
Liyuan, Huicheng, it's really Huicheng

375
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,150
Liyuan seems to have some
understanding of each other's feelings

376
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,290
It's Huicheng!!

377
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,170
Heart tightening
Oh my God - it's amazing

378
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,430
Liyuan confirmed Hui Cheng's feelings

379
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,450
Hui Cheng still knows nothing

380
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,700
Liyuan, let me take a look around

381
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,360
Hui Cheng, I was so
embarrassing singing yesterday

382
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,620
Liyuan, singing? Hui Cheng, I kept kicking
the blanket while sleeping last night

383
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,060
Liyuan, I recorded it all

384
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,200
Hui Cheng, really?

385
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,550
Liyuan, no, I didn't, no.

386
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,940
Huicheng, scared to death.

387
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,790
Huicheng, I now have
confidence that I can sing well.

388
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,470
Huicheng, can you sing
well? Li Yuan, Not good?

389
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,740
Huicheng, can you sing?

390
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,520
Li Yuan, Are you here? Now?

391
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,960
No, no.

392
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,416
Huicheng, can you play the
guitar? Li Yuan, I can't.

393
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,090
Huicheng, come over here.

394
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,980
Li Yuan, I don't even know the
chords. Huicheng, You sit here.

395
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,410
That is... JaeJae actually
teaches guitar in a typical way!

396
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,029
Very typical.

397
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,790
Is that taboo (?)

398
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,321
Zheng Lie, it is impossible not to
have physical contact like that...

399
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,000
If discovered by the singer
association, you will be sued (?)

400
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
First,

401
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,210
Hui Cheng, let me teach
you the C chord first.

402
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:44,280
You press here

403
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,510
Place your hand

404
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,830
Press it here

405
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,770
Then,

406
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,390
Press and hold it here

407
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,120
Is it like this? - Yes, just like this.

408
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,276
Huicheng, this is your first time playing, and your sound
is pretty good. Li Yuan, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

409
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,260
Huicheng, should I help
you hold down the chords?

410
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,490
Huicheng, is it supposed to be like this?

411
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,660
And then...

412
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,750
Li Yuan, there's a malfunction.

413
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
This one...

414
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,490
You try it.

415
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,560
Huicheng, these are the
chords for "First Love."

416
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,410
And then...

417
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,170
Here, here...

418
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,950
Like this

419
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,310
Here, these four

420
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,976
Huicheng, give it to me first
Li Yuan, something feels off

421
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,890
Huicheng, do you know? "First
Love"? Li Yuan, of course I know

422
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,870
Li Yuan, try playing it

423
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,800
Li Yuan, wow, you play so well, you're
amazing Huicheng, it's quite magical, right?

424
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:12,860
I know, when gently
tapping on the heart's door

425
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,610
I will make you, whose vision
is blurred by tears, leave

426
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,150
Memories slip away in
the fast-moving hour hand.

427
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:35,980
From our first encounter, you always
had a smile on your face until the end.

428
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:44,080
To avoid becoming ashes,
I turned away and left.

429
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:52,120
But on the blank paper, our
colors have already stained.

430
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:59,770
It doesn't have to be
perfect, just a beautiful movie.

431
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,620
In the nights we stayed, the
sound of our pounding hearts.

432
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,920
Shooting stars paint your
silhouette in the night sky.

433
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:25,310
At this moment, I am immersed
in the time spent with you.

434
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:33,730
I name it first love.

435
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,660
Liyuan, you're so amazing.
Huisheng, you're really amazing too.

436
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
Liyuan, so handsome.

437
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,230
Huisheng, so handsome.

438
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,950
Very handsome.

439
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:49,360
Huisheng and Liyuan's "First Love."

440
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,390
JaeJae, Liyuan is really...

441
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,640
I hope they can get married.

442
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,386
JaeJae, is this something to
say to 17 or 18-year-old kids?

443
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,409
Chuu, so fast?

444
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,150
I already have an image in my head.

445
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,550
The wedding plan has been completed.
Really?
I already have an image in my head.

446
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,040
The wedding plan has been completed.
Really?

447
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,200
YooLi also came to the base.

448
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,240
Zheng YooLi.
YooLi, Zheng YooLi.

449
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,610
YooLi, is there really something?

450
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,370
YooLi's locker is empty.
No, I didn't see anything at all.

451
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,290
The young boy who confessed
his feelings to Hui-rene is...

452
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,140
The young boy who confessed his
feelings to Hui-rene is Sung Yoon.

453
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,690
What's going on, Zhenglie?

454
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,110
- What's going on? - It's Chengyun.
What's going on, Zhenglie?

455
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,470
- What's going on? - It's Chengyun.

456
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,760
What happened?

457
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
JaeJae, it's Chengyun.
What happened?

458
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,750
What happened?

459
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,940
Huiren, because there was a photo,
I naturally thought it was Dongxu.

460
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,120
Huiren, but because it's
Chengyun, I was slightly panicked.

461
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,690
The day of Huiren's first appearance.

462
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,330
Chengyun silently watching from behind.

463
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,140
My name is Huiren.
Chengyun silently watching from behind.

464
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,660
Chengyun silently watching from behind.

465
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,540
The expression is more cheerful than ever.

466
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,620
The girl who is admired
by the young boy, Yayan.

467
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,370
There is nothing in the locker.

468
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,130
So that's how it is, Yayan...

469
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,640
Yayan saw the empty locker.

470
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,896
Ran into Chengyun. Chengyun: Hey, come
and make plaster (air freshener) with me.

471
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,130
Ran into Chengyun. Chengyun:
Come in and make plaster.

472
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,186
-What? -Come inside and make plaster.
Ran into Chengyun. Chengyun:
Come in and make plaster.

473
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:45,210
Ran into Chengyun. Chengyun:
Come in and make plaster.

474
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,530
Okay.
Ran into Chengyun. Chengyun:
Come in and make plaster.

475
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:46,920
Ran into Chengyun. Chengyun:
Come in and make plaster.

476
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,180
-Plaster? -Yes.

477
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,009
Chengyun, we are making plaster
inside, and Xiumin, Yayan, thank you.

478
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,159
-Thank you. -Yes, make something.

479
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,350
Chengyun and Yayan passed
by each other like this.

480
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,430
You have feelings.
Oh... What should I do...

481
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,440
JaeJae, so heartbroken.

482
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,296
Zhenglie, but now my heart is broken...
- Why not - There's a little something in my heart

483
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,150
JaeJae, why didn't
everyone put photos in it?

484
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,160
Huicheng's hobbies are knitting.

485
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,390
Xiumin, you seem to be good
at making cute handicrafts.

486
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,920
Xiumin, I have also made small
models when I was in elementary school.

487
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,890
Huicheng, this is very interesting.

488
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,570
Dongxu, Xiumin, what uniform
are you planning to wear today?

489
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,410
Xiumin, what do you think I should wear?

490
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,970
Dongxu, uniform?

491
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,620
Dongxu, short-sleeved...

492
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,136
Xiumin, I was originally planning to wear long
sleeves. Dongxu, Planning to wear long sleeves?

493
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,266
Xiumin, looks like I'll
have to wear short sleeves.

494
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,420
Dongxu, no, wear long sleeves. Xiumin, why?

495
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,186
Xiumin, didn't you tell me to
wear short sleeves? Dongxu, Huh?

496
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,130
Xiumin, didn't you ask
me to wear short sleeves?

497
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,530
Dongxu, how about long sleeves?

498
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,431
Xiumin, decide and choose one.
Dongxu, long sleeves or short sleeves?

499
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,380
Xiumin, bow tie or necktie?

500
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,080
Dongxu, you look like a
doll, so tie a bow tie.

501
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:22,640
- I'd better go back temporarily.
- You can also wear short sleeves.

502
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,520
Huicheng, should I
temporarily go back for now?
- I'd better go back temporarily.
- You can also wear short sleeves.

503
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,250
- I'd better go back temporarily.
- You can also wear short sleeves.

504
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,520
Huicheng

505
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:28,930
- Ah, so cute! - So cute.

506
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,320
Zhenglie, ah, so cute!
- Ah, so cute! - So cute.

507
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,530
- Ah, so cute! - So cute.

508
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,480
Youqing, I should probably
go back temporarily.

509
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,350
Xiumin, I feel like going out a bit.

510
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,265
Dongxu, where are you
going? Xiumin, outside.

511
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:41,780
- Going outside? - Yes.

512
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,640
Dongxu, are you going out? Xiumin, no.
- Going outside? - Yes.

513
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,060
Dongxu, are you going out? Xiumin, no.

514
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,900
Xiumin, a tie. Dongxu,
then I'll also put on a tie.

515
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,160
Is that so?

516
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,410
Dongxu, the next day
we were like stylists...

517
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,265
Junrong walked into the rest room.

518
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:00,550
Oh, the uniform. He
feels more like a model.

519
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,180
Xiumin feels he looks more like a model.
Oh, the uniform. He
feels more like a model.

520
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,540
Xiumin feels he looks more like a model.

521
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,820
Junrong: I've changed.

522
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,036
Xiumin: It's like we're shooting
a magazine photo. Junrong: Me?

523
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Xiumin: It's amazing because he is tall.

524
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,730
Xiumin, how do you like to
match your clothes? Both of you?

525
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,346
Dongxu, I like it to be clean
and neat. Xiumin, clean and neat.

526
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,910
Junrong, I'm a little... Dongxu,
like dressing like a model?

527
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,090
Junrong, how about you?

528
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,830
Xiumin, for me... white clothes?

529
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,270
Junrong, princess clothes?
Xiumin, no, not princess clothes.

530
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,620
Xiumin, I want to go take
photos with Junrong brother.

531
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,940
Junrong, with whom?
Dongxu, Junrong brother.

532
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Junrong, with me? Do you want to go?

533
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,240
- With me? - Yeah.
Junrong, with me? Do you want to go?

534
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,250
Junrong, with me? Do you want to go?

535
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,920
Xiumin, I'm very curious
about how we'll pose.

536
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,150
Junrong, yes, no matter how many poses
we've done before, it's still difficult.

537
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,840
JaeJae, oh, in front of Dongxu?

538
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,940
JaeJae's heart is in turmoil.

539
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,480
JaeJae has now chosen a
difficult target as his first love.

540
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,736
-Well -Dongxu just now.
He's in love, Dongxu just now.

541
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,570
-Yes -He trembled slightly.
Zhenglie trembled slightly.

542
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,460
-Right -He trembled twice.

543
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,649
HOWL is it to keep him on his guard?

544
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,290
-That's what I'm saying -What's going on?

545
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,550
In the small resting room,
only Junrong and Xiumin are left.

546
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,390
Junrong: Did you have fun yesterday?

547
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,960
Xiumin: Me? Yes.
Xiumin: What about me?

548
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,930
Xiumin: A date? Junrong:
Didn't we go out for a meal?

549
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,370
Xiumin: It was a bit
sudden, so I was flustered.

550
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,720
Xiumin: They suddenly came in and said
they were going on a date, and also...

551
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,080
Xiumin: I should have...
spoken a little more.

552
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,410
Junrong, just be casual.

553
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,076
Junrong, I think it's better to
showcase your unique personality.

554
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,770
Junrong, something like a princess style?

555
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,080
Xiumin, why am I a princess?

556
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,910
Junrong, you're kind of like a princess.

557
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,230
Junrong, but you're always
sticking with Dongxu, right?

558
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:50,000
Xiumin, Dongxu didn't sleep
well yesterday, and neither did I.

559
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,540
Junrong, why didn't you sleep well?

560
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,870
Xiumin, I thought Dongxu gege
was avoiding me last night.

561
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,696
Xiumin, I intentionally sat next to him
because I wanted to sit together with him...

562
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,870
Xiumin, but he moved to another seat.

563
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,910
Junrong, the two of you Didn't just the two
of you go out for dinner? A delicious dinner.

564
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,896
Junrong, is it because he thinks that if you two sit
together others will dislike it, that's why he did that?

565
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,390
Is Xiumin?

566
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,200
Junrong considering everything

567
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,416
Junrong Dongxu seems to be
very good at playing the piano

568
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,885
No, he chose piano lessons

569
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:27,150
Xiumin, he chose piano lessons

570
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,490
Xiumin, I didn't know he was good at playing
the piano, he prepared "Three Little Bears"

571
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,180
Junrong, I saw it, I saw the sheet music

572
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,710
Xiumin, he clearly can play
but pretended not to for me.

573
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,370
Junrong is really cute.

574
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,860
Junrong, "Three Little Bears"...

575
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,680
Xiumin should play the kind
of song like "Secret" dance.

576
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,930
For Junrong, there is also
a secret that cannot be told.

577
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,600
Oh my god, do you know? It's so crazy. Oh my god.
- But...

578
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,689
Yayan, to be honest, he seems uninterested in
me. Yuli, no... you should talk to him more.

579
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,029
Yuri has more than before.

580
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,859
Yuri is like this because he is shy.

581
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,499
Yaeun is shy, but I feel like he likes
someone else. Yuri: No, I don't think so.

582
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,199
Yuri, did you have a crush
on Seonyun from the beginning?

583
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,890
My first impression of him was really good.

584
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:19,130
The main character of the
conversation is Seonyun.

585
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,130
Really?
The main character of the
conversation is Seonyun.

586
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,970
The main character of the
conversation is Seonyun.

587
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,179
Yuri, where? What do you like about
him? Is his appearance your type?

588
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,620
Yayan, at first, I liked his face,

589
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,050
- I liked his face at first - Yeah,
Yayan, at first, I liked his face,

590
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,610
Yayan, at first, I liked his face,

591
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:27,810
Yayan, the first impression he gives
is quite strong when meeting people,

592
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,330
- The first impression he gives
is quite strong - That's right,
Yayan, the first impression he gives
is quite strong when meeting people,

593
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,090
Yayan, the first impression he gives
is quite strong when meeting people,

594
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,649
Yayan, so I keep thinking about him,

595
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,629
Yayan, and when Chengyun takes care
of others, he would hand me a bowl.

596
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,129
Yayan will take care of
people in such small matters.

597
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,770
Yayan, I don't know why,
but this really moves me.

598
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,840
Yuli, I completely understand.

599
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,169
Yayan, but... I don't understand his heart.

600
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,179
Yayan, he is naturally
kind and good to everyone.

601
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,309
Yayan, he doesn't really express himself...

602
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,679
Yuli, it would be
confusing if I were a guy.

603
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,919
Yuri: To be honest, I don't
understand my own heart.

604
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,596
Yuri: How could they possibly know who I like?
- How could they possibly know who I like? -That's right.

605
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,619
Yuri: Maybe that's how
it is, so I'll be honest.

606
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,939
Yuri: No matter what, it's important
to express your true feelings.

607
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,590
- That's right, I want to express myself too.
- That's right. Yerim: That's right, I want to express myself too.

608
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:21,870
Yuli, so believe in your own
feelings Just follow your heart, really

609
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:29,779
Yuli, let's chat more with him today
Yayan, we can also go out for a walk

610
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,610
Yayan, I also want to ask him

611
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,260
- Because he already likes Tuantuan & Yunyun - That's
right Yayan, because he already likes Tuantuan & Yunyun

612
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:37,680
Yayan, I want to ask him if he wants
to take another walk together tonight

613
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,520
Okay.
Yayan, I want to ask him if he wants
to take another walk together tonight

614
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:38,890
Okay.

615
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,959
Yayan, because he goes to see Tuantuan and Yunyun by
himself every day. Yuri: Hmm, ask quickly, really.

616
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,489
Yayan, I plan to ask him when we are alone
together. Yuri: Ask quickly, that's good.

617
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,656
Yayan: Should we take Tuantuan
and Yunyun for a walk...?

618
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,956
There must be someone he likes,
someone he has feelings for.

619
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,050
It's impossible for there to be no one.

620
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,169
I felt movement behind me.

621
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,050
Impossible to be without

622
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,640
Desperately escaping

623
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,510
What is Xiumin sister doing?

624
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,060
What are you doing?

625
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:08,950
It's Xiumin.
- You scared me -Xiumin

626
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,519
Yuli, I was so scared... Xiumin, why...?

627
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,750
Yayun, we thought it was
someone else. Xiumin, oh really?

628
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,666
Let's take a photo together -We're in the middle of a conversation...
Xiumin, let's take a photo... Let's take it together. Yuli, okay.

629
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,530
You scared me, Yu Li.

630
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,800
Boy's dormitory.

631
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,970
Dong Xu is getting ready to meet Xiu Min.

632
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,830
Ya Yan, it's really hot today.

633
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,040
Dong Xu, Ya Yan.
- Ya Yan - Hmm.

634
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:44,739
Dong Xu, can I ask what you talked about with Xiu
Min yesterday... Ya Yan, what did you talk about?

635
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,810
Ya Yan, I don't know if I can tell you.

636
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,220
Ya Yan, it's a secret.
Dong Xu, is it a secret?

637
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,319
Dong Xu, it's not because there's a misunderstanding between us. Ya
Yan, a misunderstanding, but it seems like we just talked it out.

638
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,459
Ya Yan, didn't you guys talk it out? Dong
Xu, yes, we did talk it out to some extent.

639
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,930
Ya Yan, that's good.

640
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,960
Ya Yan, behave well and treat her nicely.

641
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,269
Dong Xu, it's difficult because I've never
done this before as a single person from birth.

642
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,190
Ya Yan, me too. I haven't been in a
relationship since elementary school.

643
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,180
Yayan is really difficult.

644
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,880
Dongxu, are you here?

645
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,479
Xiumin, let's go take
photos. Dongxu, alright.

646
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,819
Yayan, I'll tidy up first. Dongxu, why?

647
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,749
Yayan, no, it's really almost done.
Just put this in and it'll be fine.

648
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,019
Xiumin, let's finish tidying up and then take photos
together. Yayan, no, it's almost done, almost done.

649
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,129
You guys go ahead, take care~

650
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,190
Yayan, I want to be alone.

651
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
Oh my, what should I do?
Yayan is really amazing.

652
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,899
So cool, how did she
understand it all of a sudden?

653
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
If it were me, I would go together.

654
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,610
Okay.

655
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,440
Let's go and take photos
in uniforms together.

656
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,940
Su-min, let's go this way.

657
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,560
Su-min, you go in first. Dong-xu: Okay.

658
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,500
Su-min, are you okay? Dong-xu: I'm fine.

659
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,370
Dongxu, let's take some cute pictures.

660
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,800
Xiumin, how about
posing with hands on face?

661
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,780
Xiumin, let's do that.

662
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,820
Xiumin, the pictures
turned out really nice.

663
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,189
Dongxu, are the pictures good?

664
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,266
Xiumin, you look handsome in the pictures.

665
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,070
I always look strange in pictures.

666
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,170
Dongxu, I always feel strange
when taking pictures with you.

667
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,730
Me too, I can only make
one facial expression.

668
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,469
JaeJae can only make one expression?

669
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,239
JaeJae, their expression is too...

670
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,270
JaeJae, although youthful, but great.

671
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,926
- Although youthful -
That's right, that's right.
JaeJae, although youthful, but great.

672
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:54,950
JaeJae, although youthful, but great.

673
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,080
- Like lyrics - But great.
JaeJae, although youthful, but great.

674
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,260
Chuu, poetic and emotional expression.
- Like lyrics - But great.

675
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,600
Chuu, poetic and emotional expression.

676
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,860
When I see you, I can
only make one expression.

677
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,599
Soo Min, do you want to
go to the resting room?

678
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,769
Dong Uk, can I go and change my
clothes? Soo Min, you can go and change.

679
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,930
Dongxu, it's your turn to
go and change. Xiumin: Okay.

680
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,190
Xiumin: I need to go to
the lounge quickly. Goodbye.

681
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,930
Dongxu: I'll go right away.

682
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,870
Xiumin: It's me.

683
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,809
Xiumin: Ting! Who wants to see it?

684
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,810
Yayan: Take a look.

685
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,450
Junrong: The pictures are well taken.
Yayan: Indeed, they are well taken.

686
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,050
-Isn't it cute? -Let me see.
Xiumin: Isn't it cute?
Junrong: The pictures are well taken.
Yayan: Indeed, they are well taken.

687
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,490
-Isn't it cute? -Let me see.
Xiumin: Isn't it cute?

688
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,450
Hui Ren took a great photo.

689
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,430
- It suits well, right? - Hmm.
Does it suit well?

690
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,130
Xiù Mǐn, I'm here to show off.

691
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,330
Hui Cheng, also here to show off.

692
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:31,270
- Where are you going? - Dormitory.

693
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,710
Dong Xu, where are you going?
- Where are you going? - Dormitory.

694
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,720
- Where are you going? - Dormitory.

695
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,609
Zheng Lie, what's going on?

696
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,380
Chuu, isn't this a movie?

697
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,580
Are they really shooting a movie?

698
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,130
Yayan, what should I do...
Yoonli, what should I do?

699
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,991
Yayan, I can only seek advice for
my troubles Yoonli, I do it for you

700
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,399
Yoonli, for the sake of your feelings

701
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,130
Yayan, I came here to
seek advice for my troubles

702
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,809
Yayan, Do Re Mi Fa So

703
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,310
Yayan, three little bears

704
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,920
So La Ti
Yayan's condition is unusual

705
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:55,170
In a household

706
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,566
Yayan, is he Dadada? Yuli, Yes, you're
right. Is it your first time seeing him?

707
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:04,000
Yayan, Yes, it's the first time. Yuli,
Let's talk here. This is my resting place.

708
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,429
Liyuan, Yayan~

709
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,900
-It's Dadada. Dadada, right? -Yes.
Liyuan makes an appearance.

710
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,830
Sister, come over here.

711
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:12,300
Yuli, come here. Let's talk.

712
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,979
Yuli, how is sister doing now?
Has she moved forward? Liyuan, Yes.

713
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,110
You Li, okay.

714
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,210
Ya Yan, what should I do...

715
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,919
Li Yuan, first... pull it over.

716
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,849
Ya Yan, can't get close.
Li Yuan, need to get closer.

717
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,390
Ya Yan, I feel burdened. Li
Yuan, no, it's not like that.

718
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,989
Li Yuan, wait, in that case,
let's get closer today and tomorrow.

719
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,760
Li Yuan, and now, you pull...
you push... did you pull it over?

720
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,070
Liyuan, and then suddenly
start pushing away (?)

721
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,116
Liyuan, "to catch by letting go" Yayan, "to catch
by letting go" hahaha I really don't know...

722
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,839
Liyuan, to be honest, the best
time for pulling is 1 to 2 weeks.

723
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,679
Liyuan, but we don't have that (time).

724
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,309
Liyuan, so let's pull for two days first.

725
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,760
Liyuan, and then directly push away.

726
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,580
- Tonight...
- He will wonder why Yayan suddenly treated me like this.

727
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,260
Riyan's Push-Pull Day Course

728
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:03,330
Did she give up on herself?
He will know for himself.

729
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,529
Yayan, give it a try.
Liyan, start by pulling.

730
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,829
Yuli, pull it over here.

731
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,200
Yayan, OK, preparation complete.

732
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,180
Liyan, the kind of push-pull expert on
social media, seems to have said those words.

733
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,440
The kind of push-pull expert on YouTube
Liyan, the kind of push-pull expert on
social media, seems to have said those words.

737
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,910
Lijuan, but... no
guarantee! Haven't tried...

738
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,890
Yayan goes to where?

739
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,490
There are Tuantuan & Yunyun and Chengyun.

740
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,860
Jaejae, if it's that level, we Yayan

741
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,030
Have to wear a dog mask and go over.

742
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,606
- If you want to get into
Chengyun's heart - Not bad.

743
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,320
Quite innovative method (?)
He's a genius, a genius.

744
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,640
Very innovative.

Discovered Yayan

748
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,280
Yayan Ah Tuantuan!

749
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,350
Warmly welcome Yayan's Tuantuan & Yunyun

750
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,850
- Too much, always with me - What's wrong?
Chengyun, too much, always with me

751
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:10,080
Yayan likes me. I just came by earlier.

752

- Likes me? - Came straight to me

Chengyun, give it to me.

757
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,930
Chengyun, don't ignore me... Yayan, that's
right, she's been here the whole time too.

758
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,000
Running over here.

759
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,640
Yayan, do you like me more?

760
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,179
Chengyun, yunyun... tuantuan...

761
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,140
Chengyun, tuantuan... tuantuan!

762
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,549
Yayan, Tuantuan, go~

763
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,820
Not moving at all.
Are you really not coming?

764
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,780
Yayan, should I go over there then?

765
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,350
Come over.
Yayan, should I go over there then?

766
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:38,780
Come over.

767
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,490
Yayan walked over.

768
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,620
Round and round

769
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,060
Shedding a lot of fur

770
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,639
Finally face to face

771
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,260
Why are you so cute?

772
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,140
Yayan, you said you have a dog, right?
Chengyun: Yeah, do you have any pets?

773
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:06,440
I have had pets before, but

774
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:07,490
Yayan, I have had pets before, but... in
April of this year... Chengyun: Ah, really?

775
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:10,680
Not long ago, in April of this year
Yayan, I have had pets before, but... in
April of this year... Chengyun: Ah, really?

776
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:10,880
Yayan, I have had pets before, but... in

778
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:11,880
Yayan, I have had pets before, but... in
April of this year... Chengyun: Ah, really?

779
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,820
Yayan is called Kami and is
a Teddy dog, about this big.

780
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,690
Yayan is very cute...

781
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,900
Chengyun, I have also raised it for
the second time and sent it away once.

782
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,499
Chengyun, it has been there before I was born.
Yayan, really? That must have been very painful.

783
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,670
Chengyun, yes, I cried.

784
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,540
Yayan, I cried a lot.
Chengyun, I also cried a lot.

785
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,840
Yayan, wait a moment.

786
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,170
Wait a moment.

787
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,729
Chengyun, ah, it's so hot.
Yayan, yes, I want to eat ice cream.

788
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,660
Chengyun, ice cream?

789
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,299
Yayan, will there be
convenience stores nearby?

790
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,639
Chengyun, are there convenience stores?
Yayan, um, I feel like everyone wants to go?

791
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,380
Chengyun, ah, really? Yayan, there should
be, or we can go to the supermarket...

792
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,169

00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,030
Junrong, the lighting right

834
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:03,550
Really?

00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,630
Yayan, suddenly you're

It's a must-read.

842
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:25,210
Yayan, I only know "Romeo and Juliet."

843
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,250
Yayan has a complicated inner world.

844
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,220
Yayan, brother, does brother
already know his own feelings?

845
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,619

Junrong, are you asking if I know my own
feelings? How can one know their own feelings?

848
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,830
Does Yayan have feelings for anyone?

if I remember someone?

Yayan, I really don't understand
boys, except for one person.

855
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,440
Yayan, I really don't understand.

856
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,186
Junrong, I think it's possible
that they have no thoughts at all.

857
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,919
Yayan, boys? Really?

858

Junrong is here to enjoy the righteous travel.
- Are you here to enjoy righteous travel? - Is that so?

859
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,120
Yayan is like an off-campus teaching trip,
"Let's go, brothers~" And then it ends?

860
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,590
Yayan doesn't understand.
It's so difficult.

861
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,360
Junrong, it was
originally a difficult task.

862
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,470
Yayan really doesn't understand.

863
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,600
Yayan, it's not easy.

864
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,080

You just took a selfie with the
dog, I secretly took a picture.

Yayan: I wanted to chat
with him just now too.

946
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:20,039
Yayan: But he wouldn't do that, He doesn't treat
me like he treats Jiejie Liyuan and Huiran.

947
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,809
Xiumin: How does he speak?
Does he just keep answering?

948
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,939
Yayan: That's right, the
conversation doesn't continue.

949
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,519
Yayan: When it comes to Jiejie Liyuan, he
would take the initiative to start a topic.

950
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,126
Yayan, but not like that to me
Xiumin, not like that to me either!

951
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,489
Yayan, what about you...
isn't your calling unclear?

952
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,190
Yayan, but I've been
expressing myself repeatedly...

953
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,000
And he doesn't respond either

954
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:45,360
Yayan is heartbroken

955
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:46,400
- In my opinion, Seongyun
should like Huiran - Yeah

956
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,480
Zhenglie, in my opinion,
Seongyun should like Huiran
- In my opinion, Seongyun
should like Huiran - Yeah

957
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,740
- In my opinion, Seongyun
should like Huiran - Yeah

958
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:49,910
Zhenglie, if we're talking purely
- In my opinion, Seongyun
should like Huiran - Yeah

959
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,720
Zhenglie, if we're talking purely

960
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:54,440
- If simplifying it - Yeah, right

961
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,159
JaeJae seems to really like Hye In

962
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,380
Is that so?

963
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,836
- The reactions seem a bit different - Yeah,
different HOWL's reactions seem a bit different too

964
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,556
Yeah, it seems like he also smiles at her
Chuu also seems to smile at her

965
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,810
She talks a lot too

966
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,550
Ya Yan

967
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,666
- What should we do?
- What should we do, really What should we do if there are feelings, really

968
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,120
Hui Ren, do you have a pet dog?

969
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,490
Cheng Yun, hmm, I do have one.

970
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,030
Hui Ren, I was planning to
take our dog Bi Bi for a walk.

971
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,395
Hui Ren, but... I got dragged
away, it took me for a walk instead.

972
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:23,750
-Is it Tuan Tuan? -Hmm.

973
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,606
Cheng Yun, take a look at this,
I took a picture of Tuan Tuan.

974
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,140
I also took one.

975
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:28,350
Showing off a group photo

976
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,470
I still have this
Showing off a group photo

977
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:29,730
Showing off a group photo

978
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:30,730
This one
Showing off a group photo

979
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,480
Showing off a group photo

980
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:34,270
Chengyun, do you want one? I have two

981
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,730
- Do you want one? - Hmm
Chengyun, do you want one? I have two

982
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:35,870
Chengyun, do you want one? I have two

983
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,950
I have two
Chengyun, do you want one? I have two

984
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:37,100
I have two

985
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,229
Sharing the same photo with Huirun

986
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,506
You really captured it perfectly

987
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,920
It only showed me the back

988
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,530
It suddenly rubbed against me

989
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,390
Like Chengyun, I keep it in a phone case

990
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,490
I have it too
Like Chengyun, I keep it in a phone case

991
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:45,690
Like Chengyun, I keep it in a phone case

992
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,971
I heard that it won't jump
when other people approach it.
Like Chengyun, I keep it in a phone case

993
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:48,090
Like Chengyun, I keep it in a phone case

994
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,699
Chengyun, it's fine to start growing up now.
Take it for a walk frequently. Huiren: Okay!

995
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,740
Chengyun: It seems to
really enjoy going for walks.

996
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,680
Zhenglie: It really talks a lot.
- Talks a lot indeed - Talks a lot.

997
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,000
Yes, talks a lot.
Zhenglie: It really talks a lot.
- Talks a lot indeed - Talks a lot.

998
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,440
Yes, talks a lot.

999
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,660
JaeJae: Turns out it's a chatterbox. Chatterbox. It turns
out you're talkative. Talkative - so many words indeed.
Yes, talks a lot.

1000
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,670
JaeJae: Turns out it's a chatterbox. Chatterbox. It turns
out you're talkative. Talkative - so many words indeed.

1001
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:58,770
No, I'm not.
JaeJae: Turns out it's a chatterbox. Chatterbox. It turns
out you're talkative. Talkative - so many words indeed.

1002
00:57:58,770 --> 00:57:58,900
No, I'm not.

1003
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,370
JaeJae, I thought you only
liked Tuantuan & Yunyun.

1004
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,020
It's love, huh... Why is it like this?

1005
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:05,790
It seems like you really like Huiran.

1006
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,579
Huicheng and Liyuan went to the seaside.

1007
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,820
Huicheng, be careful at all times.
Liyuan: Hahaha. Be careful at all times.

1008
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,580
Be careful, be careful.

1009
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,460
Huicheng, be careful,
be cautious Liyuan, haha
Be careful, be careful.

1010
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,720
Huicheng, be careful,
be cautious Liyuan, haha

1011
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,560
This morning Today is really hot

1012
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,540
Liyuan, with this kind of weather
today, we should go to the seaside

1013
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,329
Chengyun, Oh, you scared
me. How did you come here?

1014
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,200
Liyuan, If Huicheng comes back, tell him to
change clothes and go to the seaside later

1015
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,439
Chengyun, Huicheng, Liyuan
sister... Have you heard?

1016
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,730
Huicheng, is she injured? What happened?

1017
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:38,846
-Is she injured? -No, she isn't.
Huicheng, is she injured? What happened?

1018
00:58:38,846 --> 00:58:38,870
Huicheng, is she injured? What happened?

1019
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:39,440
What happened?
Huicheng, is she injured? What happened?

1020
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:39,850
Huicheng, is she injured? What happened?

1021
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,570
Chengyun said she wants to go see
the sea with you. Huicheng, today?

1022
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,150
What time, Huicheng? Chengyun doesn't
know. Go find Liyuan sister and ask.

1023
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:49,720
Liyuan and Huicheng
spent some time together.

1024
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,120
-That's great. -Hmm.
Liyuan and Huicheng
spent some time together.

1025
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,370
Liyuan and Huicheng
spent some time together.

1026
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,610
That's fantastic.
Liyuan and Huicheng
spent some time together.

1027
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,060
Liyuan and Huicheng
spent some time together.

1028
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,529
Does JaeJae ride a bicycle to see
the sea? It feels like it's very far.

1029
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,070
For them, the farther the better...

1030
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,370
Huicheng: Be careful of the stones.
Liyuan: Be careful of the fire?

1031
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:04,470
Stones, stones.
Huicheng: Be careful of the stones.
Liyuan: Be careful of the fire?

1032
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,370
Stones, stones.

1033
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,749
Liyuan: Run! Huicheng: Be careful of
the vehicles, ride on the right side.

1034
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,320
Liyuan: I already know!

1035
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,920
I already know.

1036
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,460
Huicheng: Oh, they can
even ride standing up!

1037
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,779
Huicheng's personal
skills made Liyuan laugh.

1038
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,910
Be careful, be careful.

1039
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,869
Huicheng, fortunately,
didn't stay in the lounge!

1040
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,699
Huicheng, how happy? Liyuan, yeah.

1041
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,440
Huicheng, it feels so
cool. Liyuan, feels so cool.

1042
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,600
It's really great.

1043
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,610
Wow, it's awesome.

1044
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,480
Huicheng, look at the right side.

1045
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,520
Liyuan, wow.

1046
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,429
Huicheng is so beautiful.

1047
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,460
Liyuan: Yes, it is.

1048
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,295
Huicheng: The sky really
looks like a rainbow!

1049
01:00:07,296 --> 01:00:08,520
Liyuan: How romantic!

1050
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,870
Look to the right, it's true.

1051
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,970
It's amazing.

1052
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,410
Huicheng: The setting sun is so beautiful.

1053
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:22,580
Thank you for giving me such an experience.

1054
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,520
The empty road only has the two of them

1055
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,690
Li Yuan wants to start running

1056
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,570
Huicheng, let's walk
together, let's walk together

1057
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,470
Li Yuan, come over quickly

1058
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,779
Li Yuan, is your speed too slow?

1059
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,849
Huicheng, do you want to
ride faster? Li Yuan: Yes!

1060
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,480
Huicheng: I want to catch up

1061
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,750
I want to catch up

1062
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,130
Huicheng, I'm going to catch up, hahaha.

1063
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,670
Wow, getting faster.

1064
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,130
Wow, so interesting.

1065
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:13,370
Like the distance getting closer.

1066
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,370
Fantastic.
Like the distance getting closer.

1067
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:14,630
Like the distance getting closer.

1068
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:16,730
The emotional distance
is also getting closer.

1069
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,940
"We ride well." - "Hmm."
The emotional distance
is also getting closer.

1070
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,640
The emotional distance
is also getting closer.

1071
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,710
Liyuan, wow, it's a beach.

1072
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,180
Liyuan, ah, my hair is all messed up.

1073
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,850
Huicheng, it's not a big
deal. Liyuan, ah, my hair...

1074
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,960
Take a look.

1075
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,260
Huicheng, otherwise let's
take a walk wearing helmets?

1076
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,790
Liyuan, hahaha, that's great?
Wow, that's great. That
wouldn't be bad either.

1077
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,990
Wow, that's great. That
wouldn't be bad either.

1078
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,520
So funny.

1079
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,499
Liyuan, impressive, that's great.

1080
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,969
Liyuan, it's the first time I've
seen such a close-up of the wild geese.

1081
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,469
Huicheng, will they come over? We
should give them some shrimp chips.

1082
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,469
Liyuan, do you have any money?

1083
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:59,790
Liyuan, didn't you say you don't have money?
Haha. Huicheng, do you have any money?

1084
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,820
Huicheng, you're really
amazing. It's so cool.

1085
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,189
Huicheng, isn't it too beautiful?

1086
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,110
Liyuan, that's what I'm saying.
Huicheng, how can clouds be so beautiful?

1087
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:17,130
Liyuan, wow! (rippling water) It's really
magical. Huicheng, it's truly magical.

1088
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,230
Huicheng is a completely different
world, isn't it? 丽媛: Yeah, it's amazing!

1089
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,569
丽媛: Oh, clams are coming
out. Have you seen them?

1090
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,509
丽媛: Should I catch one?

1091
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,780
Huicheng: Is that a clam... is it a clam?
丽媛: Yes, it's that kind of bamboo clam.

1092
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,670
- Can I catch it? - This one?

1093
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,686
Huicheng: That's not, not a
clam. Haha. 丽媛: Really? Ah, is it?

1094
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,720
-No, it isn't. Right?

1095
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,680
I have never caught it before.

1096
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,090
Due to Lijuan's unconventional
approach, Huicheng burst into laughter.
I have never caught it before.

1097
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:39,330
Due to Lijuan's unconventional
approach, Huicheng burst into laughter.

1098
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,800
So I don't know.
Due to Lijuan's unconventional
approach, Huicheng burst into laughter.

1099
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,180
Due to Lijuan's unconventional
approach, Huicheng burst into laughter.

1100
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:41,520
-Ah, is that so? -Ah, really?
Ah~ Is that so?
Due to Lijuan's unconventional
approach, Huicheng burst into laughter.

1101
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,950
-Ah, is that so? -Ah, really?
Ah~ Is that so?

1102
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,360
The degree of sweetness is
equivalent to candied haws.

1103
01:02:47,361 --> 01:02:49,370
-Ah, that's not clams. Is it that funny?

1104
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,399
How high does the tone
of "love" have to rise?

1105
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,130
Where should the musical scale ascend to?

1106
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:56,790
Huicheng, we also need to take photos.
Li Yuan, do you like taking photos?

1107
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,570
We still need to take photos.
Huicheng, we also need to take photos.

1109
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,670

01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:01,070
Huicheng: "Hmm, do you want me to help you take

Huicheng: "Hmm, do you want me to help you take

1116
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,309
Liyuan, I'll help you take a photo.

1117
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,560
-Take a photo of me? -Yes.

1118
01:03:09,561 --> 01:03:13,469
Liyuan, I took a pretty good photo. Huicheng,
but I don't look very good in photos.

1119
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:16,230
-I'll help you take a good photo. -Okay.
Liyuan, I'll help you take a good photo!

1120
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:19,989
Liyuan, but anyway, it's backlit
and you can't see your face!

1121
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,190
Huicheng, then I will radiate my
charm. After all, you can't see my face.

1122
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,190
Li Yuan, ah, so funny.

1123
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,300
The atmosphere is a bit...

1124
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,880
The charm of Li Yuan is amazing, right?
The atmosphere is a bit...

1125

Ah, it's great.

Ah, it's great.

1128
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,550
But you are too...

1129
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,500
A bit...

1130
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,650
Not like a human anymore.

1131
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:35,990
- Is that so? - It's too long.

1132
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,240
But it's really...

1133
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,620
Alright, alright.

1134
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:41,380
The girl took 25 photos of the young boy.

1135
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,850
Li Yuan, you don't look like a human
anymore... The shooting took too long.

1136
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,540
Huicheng: Haha, it's... too long,
right? Li Yuan: Yeah, it's too long!

1137
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:54,360
Li Yuan: Wow, yeah, it's
a bit oh my gosh, ay yo...

1138
01:03:56,390 --> 01:04:00,400
Suddenly, an awkwardness strikes.

1139
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,040
Huicheng: Nothing, it's nothing.
Quietly

1140
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:08,716
Li Yuan: What's wrong?
Huicheng: It's nothing.

1141
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:11,700
Li Yuan: Can we go over there? The
sea over there... Huicheng: Sure, sure.

1142
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,149
Liyuan, do you like the
sea? Huicheng, the sea?

1143
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,795
Huicheng, to be honest, I've
been to the seaside many times.

1144
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:20,920
- Dad likes the seaside,
so I often say - Really?

1145
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,840
Huicheng, Dad likes the seaside, so
I often say, is it the seaside again?
- Dad likes the seaside,

01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:25,590
Huicheng, Dad likes the seaside, so
I often say, is it the seaside again?

1149
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,660
Huicheng, now the bias is
broken. Liyuan, that's great.

1150
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,459
Huicheng: Seriously, how did you
come up with the idea to come here?

1151
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,359
Liyuan: It was my suggestion.
Huicheng: Did you recommend it?

1152
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,740
Liyuan: Yes, I told you that
I wanted to come here with you.

1153
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:37,180
I want to come here with you.

1154
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,340
It's really great.
I want to come here with you.

1155
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,240
I want to come here with you.

1156
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:39,800
Can I take off my shoes?
I'll give you slippers.

1157
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,070
Liyuan, can you take off your
shoes? I should have worn slippers...

1158
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,170
Liyuan, can you take off your
shoes? I should have worn slippers...

1159
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,445
Huicheng, slippers? Oh, right!

1160
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:46,540
Let's take off our shoes here,
the seawater won't come in.

1161
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,530
Decided to take off our
shoes and enter the sea.
Let's take off our shoes here,
the seawater won't come in.

1162
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:48,709
Decided to take off our
shoes and enter the sea.

1163
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,430
- Shall we go into the sea and try? - Sure.

1164
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:53,349
Liyuan, my feet look beautiful,
right? Huicheng, really?

1165
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,000
Liyuan, the most confident part of my
body is my foot. Huicheng, oh really?

1166
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
- Oh, really? - Yes.
Liyuan, the most confident part of my
body is my foot. Huicheng, oh really?

body is my foot. Huicheng, oh really?

1168
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,020
Huicheng, I should take a look.

1169
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,819
Huicheng, take off
your shoes here, alright?

1170
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,160
Liyuan, I... can hold onto me.

1175
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,860
Huicheng, first, first... hold onto me.

1176
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:06,440
Grab my arm.

1177
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,280
Arm, grab onto my arm, my arm.

- Is it okay here?
Lixuan, be careful with your stockings, oh.

1184

Hey, wait a moment.

Lixuan successfully radiated
the charm of her feet.

1187
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,080
Lixuan, grab onto me, okay? Grab onto me.

Liyuan, that's amazing, wow.

1207
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,590
Huicheng, after your feet sink in, do you feel
a slight sensation when you pull them out?

1208
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,630
Put our feet into the seawater
together with Liyuan. I understand, wow

Huicheng learns with
friends... I study on my own

1267

01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:33,269
Liyuan, during junior high school,
you made the first choice for your life.

1278
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,270
Yes.

1279
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:35,839
It's an amazing decision!

1280
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,360
That's right.

1281
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,319
Huicheng, every moment feels
like a series of choices.

1282
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,280
- Yes, yes. - Me too.

1283
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:41,440
Depending on what choices I
make, my life will be different.

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,600
- What choices to make - Yeah, yeah

1288
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,459
Huicheng It doesn't matter,
but I chose to major a bit late

1289
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,459
Huicheng There are many
outstanding friends...

1290
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:59,699
Huicheng I myself... I don't
think I play very well...

1291
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,259
Huicheng Honestly... Honestly,
I don't have much confidence

1292
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:06,699
Huicheng The ups and downs are a
bit severe, that's how I see it...

1293
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,969
Huicheng But coming to such
a place has brought healing

1294
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,579
Huicheng I also found that
Liyuan's personality is great

1295
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:16,709
Huicheng He looks very
confident and handsome

1296
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,720

someone you like? Huicheng Me?

-Someone you like? -Hmm
Huicheng Someone I like...?

1299
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,990
Huicheng I am more open-minded

1300
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,230
Everyone looks good.

1301
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:30,510
The young man didn't confess his feelings.

1302
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:32,650
- Everyone looks good, right?
- That's right.
The young man didn't confess his feelings.

1303
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:32,910

01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:34,530
The young man didn't confess his feelings.

1306
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,670
Huicheng, I'm already
trapped in that scenery.

1307
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:41,330
Huicheng, it's the most
beautiful ocean I've ever seen.

1308
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,649
I really wish my name was Ocean.

Youqing, wow, Liyuan is really amazing
- Liyuan is really amazing - That's right

1314
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:59,030
Youqing, I also want to learn from her

1315
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,110
Chuu, isn't this a confession?

It is a confession indeed
Chuu, isn't this a confession?

It is a confession indeed

1318
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,600
Liyuan, to be honest, at that
time, my eyes were only on Huicheng

1319
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,469
Liyuan's eyes don't have the sea

1320
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,910
Liyuan is busy flirting with him

1321
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:21,430
Huicheng expressed his feelings to me with a
photo Confirmed Huicheng's feelings in the morning

1322
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:26,450
Liyuan thought that she also
had to express her feelings

1323
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:34,620
I expressed my love for you to Huicheng

1324
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:54,149
DAY4 Today's recording of Xiaoshao, the
weather in my heart, is sunny A girl's heart

1326
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,330
The evening glow is so beautiful

1327
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:03,220
Just like the sky I saw with the young boy

1328
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:11,100

the most ~ beautiful sea I've ever seen... So happy!

1330

1331
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,389
Hui Cheng went to the beach and
had exclusive time for conversation

1332
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:41,629
Huicheng At that time, Liyuan
expressed interest in me.

1333
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,630
Huicheng I am very thankful
for her courage to tell me.

1334
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,970
Liyuan and I took off our shoes
and walked along the beach together.

1335
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:58,410
I was unexpectedly amidst the fresh air, where the red clouds and
warm sunshine coexist. It really feels like entering a movie scene.

1336
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:02,910
Today is the most beautiful
sea I have ever seen.

1337

01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,266
Xiumin, which side of my face
looks better? Wait a moment.

1400
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:57,890
Both sides of your face are beautiful.

1401
01:14:57,891 --> 01:14:59,080
Oh, what is it?

1402
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,490
Xiumin, that's very captivating.

1403
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:01,880
It feels a bit strange. I'm very curious.

1404
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,420
It feels a bit strange.
It feels a bit strange. I'm very curious.

1405
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:03,630
It feels a bit strange. I'm very curious.

1406
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,330
- Is it strange? - I'm very curious.
It feels a bit strange. I'm very curious.

1407
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,160
It feels a bit strange. I'm very curious.

1408
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,870
Junrong, because you didn't
completely shut me out.

1409
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,429
Please be my girlfriend.

1410
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:12,430
Okay.

1411
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,740
Dongxu, I'm worried if
she will change her mind.

1412
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,240
I also hope it's you, my brother.

1413
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:21,050
I'm really happy.

1414
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,330
Dongxu, the way you and Junrong
walked in together, it was really...

1415
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,250
I must see that scene.

1416
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,840
Dongxu, but they will come back the latest.

1417
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,296
Dongxu, it's intriguing, isn't it?

1418
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,440
Dongxu: No, I'm not curious.

1419
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:36,890
Junrong: I don't want to
go back. Xiumin: Me neither.

1420
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,760
Xiumin: Shall we write
our names here later?

1421
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,800
Xiumin: I'm feeling a bit strange.
