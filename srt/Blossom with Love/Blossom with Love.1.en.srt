- Kind of a fierce chick vibe
- She has a bit of a chick vibe...

608
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:36,633
Because I'm tall,
I like someone a bit shorter

fast when doing the class together

880
01:11:59,436 --> 01:12:02,236
Should I say my heart opened even more?

881
01:12:02,236 --> 01:12:05,536
I think it was her charms
that really felt strong for me

882
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:07,736
How does it feel
now that I'm here?

883
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:12,689
[And a box that arrived]

884
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:16,889
[The girl's first expression
of feelings starts]

885
01:12:16,889 --> 01:12:18,689
The person I'm most drawn to

886
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:20,489
You're so pretty

887
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:22,489
You're pretty

888
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:24,989
but also has that vibe

889
01:12:24,989 --> 01:12:26,289
Can I guess who you're crush is?

890
01:12:26,289 --> 01:12:28,189
Who is yours?
Do you have one?

891
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:29,689
If I tell, will you?

892
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,843
I should give it...

893
01:12:32,843 --> 01:12:34,643
Has everyone given it
except for me?

894
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:36,143
Where do you keep going?

895
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,143
What are you doing?

896
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:38,743
Catch her!

897
01:12:38,743 --> 01:12:41,343
Ran away 'cause I was too shy...

898
01:12:42,955 --> 01:12:44,655
Why is this so fun?

899
01:12:44,655 --> 01:12:46,455
I was way too embarrassed...

900
01:12:46,455 --> 01:12:48,755
Quiet! Quiet!

901
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:52,055
Soo-min's face turned red!
