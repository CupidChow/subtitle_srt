00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,370
[Junrong, hello?]

2
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,120
[Dongxu, it's... bro...]

3
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,700
[Junrong, um... I want to talk to you]

4
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,660
[Junrong, any topic is fine]

5
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,090
[Junrong, how about... the base camp...]

6
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,240
[Junrong, what do you think... have
the couples gradually started to form?]

7
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,790
[Junrong, in your opinion, which
direction do you think it is heading?]

8
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,380
[Dongxu, as time goes by...] [Junrong,
have you become more determined?]

9
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,640
[Dongxu seems to be getting closer...]

10
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,680
[Dongxu, I'm getting closer to her.]

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,370
[Dongxu, but... I'm still not comfortable
showing it in front of others, right?]

12
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,200
[Dongxu, is she still the
one you have feelings for now?]

13
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,550
[Junrong, I don't know... I don't
really have any thoughts anymore.]

14
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,400
[I used to have a little bit of liking.]

15
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,820
I really miss you, please
come and sit down quickly.

16
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,910
[Junrong, the princess
has arrived, the princess.]

17
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,100
[Junrong, you're really beautiful.]

18
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,990
[Xiumin, what are you doing? Are you
taking a picture of me? I'm really sorry.]

19
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,646
[Junrong, oh wow, you're so beautiful,
right?] [Xiumin, of course you're beautiful.]

20
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,736
[Xiumin, by the way, who
do you want to go out with?]

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,150
[Junrong, I want to go out
with you, huh?] [Xiumin, really?]

22
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,000
Hmm
[Junrong, I want to go out
with you, huh?] [Xiumin, really?]

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,210
Hmm

24
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,240
I think as long as I honestly express my feelings, it will
be fine. [Jung Rong's heart has always been towards Xiumin.]

25
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,490
[Jung Rong, if he had gotten closer to Xiumin from the beginning, what
would it be like now? There is a bit of regret in his heart about this.]

26
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,860
[JaeJae, starting from the first choice...]

27
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,860
He should be regretting it now.

28
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,240
[Seong Hun, maybe he took
the wrong path from there.]
He should be regretting it now.

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,500
[Seong Hun, maybe he took
the wrong path from there.]

30
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:33,530
Yes, it's very important.

31
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,780
[Jung Rok, deviating from there...]
Yes, it's very important.

32
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,030
[Jung Rok, deviating from there...]

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,980
[Dong Uk, ah, so it's the piano.]

34
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,180
I play piano.

35
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,550
[Junrong and Xiumin's feelings
seem to lean more towards Dongxu.]

36
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,660
[Junrong, would you
like to go out with me?]

37
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,010
[But the girl did not answer.]

38
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,409
[Yuri, who made you cry?]

39
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,630
[Xiumin, Dongxu Liu.] [Yuri,
Dongxu Liu? He's so bad.]

40
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,990
[The girl is talking about other boys.]

41
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,430
[And that's how Junrong and
Xiumin passed each other.]

42
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,230
[You two go out.]

43
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,950
[Junrong, let's go out?] [Dongxu, alright bro,
what's there for two grown men to talk about?]

44
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,969
[Junrong, Xiumin and Dongxu are doing
well now. I'd rather not interfere.]

45
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,930
[Junrong, it's better to let them develop
well. I should feel more at ease in my heart.]

46
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,450
[Junrong, I believe that even as time passes, the
person who remains in your heart is your first love.]

47
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,099
[Although I had a first love,
it didn't become a reality]

that you were once my first love ]

62
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,770
[ You have received a request
for a private conversation ]

63
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,530
[ Chuu, a secret conversation request? ]

64
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,440
[ Who could it be, Jungly? ]

65
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,920
[ Donguk, are you
crying? ] [ Su Min, yeah ]

66
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,400
[ Su Min, I just have a lot of thoughts ]

67
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,550
What?

68
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,170
[ Su Min, because I feel
guilty... ] [ Donguk, why? ]

69
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,969
[Xiumin, I feel very happy now...]

70
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,970
Hmm

71
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,750
[Xiumin, but I'm going to
Germany] [Dongxu, it's okay]

[Dongxu, stop! Don't cry~]

74
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,100
[Dongxu, what should I say?]

75
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,060
[Dongxu, when I first came to
the main base, I noticed you]

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,430
[Dongxu, you're very beautiful, and
you're also happy when walking the dog]

77

cool name. It's unbelievable.]

[Feeling a bit uncomfortable.]

92
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,810
[Xiumin, should I say it's
jealousy? That kind of thought...]

93
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,690
[Dongxu, our feelings were the
same yesterday, right?] [Xiumin, yes.]

speaking, they always run away.]

to leave me here alone?]

feels like to like someone, huh?]

[I will always remember
that you are my first love]

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:32,450
[Xiumin, in my brother's memory, I am just his first
love I don't want to leave only this kind of impression]

118
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,850

said made me sad, so...]

Huiren. Instead, you should stick together, right?]

162
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,650
[Dongxu, you didn't cry, right?]

163
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,460
[Dongxu, I didn't cry, okay?]

164
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,690
[Xiumin, yeah ~ I came
because I heard you crying]

165
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,690
[Dongxu, I didn't cry~]

166
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,380
[Dongxu, can you tell me what
you were about to say just now?]

167
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,620
[Xiumin, it's just... I feel really
sorry for you, and it makes me sad.]

168
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,150
[Xiumin, our older brothers and
sisters are slowly becoming happy.]

169
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,750
[Xiumin, it seems like only we are
becoming more and more mournful...]

170
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,460
[Dongxu, don't think about these things.]

171
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,820
[Dongxu, because of you, I
can confirm my own feelings...]

172
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,580
[Xiumin, I have never liked
someone as much as this...]

173
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,370
[Dongxu, why are your hands so cold?]

174
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,720
[Dongxu, I want to make your hands warm.]

175
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,110
[Chuu, what kind of feeling is this?
Knowing that we are about to break up...]

176
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,500
[JaeJae, what should we do...]

177
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,670
[Chuu, I have no idea at all...]

178
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,850
[JaeJae, there's really no way...
because...] Yeah, there really is no way.

179
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,689
[JaeJae can't change reality]

180
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,300
Hmm

181
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,940
[JaeJae is like "Romeo and Juliet"]

182
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,730
Right
[JaeJae is like "Romeo and Juliet"]

183
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:54,960
Right

184
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,399
[Huicheng, what time do you
think you'll be back? Take a guess]

185
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,650
[Yayan, do you think you'll
be back after a long time?]

186
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,839
[Yayan, just enjoy yourself and then come
back] [Huicheng, hmm, that's very emotional]

187
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,930
Well, indeed

188
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,579
[Yayan looks so beautiful,
all green and lush]

189
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Hmm

190
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,069
[Yayan, I think the sky
looks really beautiful]

191
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,569
[Huicheng, really, just
casually looked up for a moment]

192
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,230
[Yayan, even the stars
from last night too!]

193
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,540
Hmm
[Yayan, even the stars
from last night too!]

194
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,560
Hmm

195
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,790
[Yayan, it's my first time looking
up at the sky. And it's at night, oh!]
Hmm

196
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,370
[Yayan, it's my first time looking
up at the sky. And it's at night, oh!]

197
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,590
[Yayan, got scared for a moment]

198
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,210
Yes, you're right.
[Yayan, got scared for a moment]

199
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,590
Yes, you're right.

200
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,009
[Huicheng The sky is beautiful
here, and so is the sunset.]

201
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,010
Really?

202
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,779
[Huicheng The nature here is all so beautiful.]
[Yayan It's really healing to come here.]

203
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Hmm.

204
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,860
[Yayan Oh, by the way,
is there a smell today?]

205
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,300
[Yayan Have a smell and see.]

206
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Have a smell and see.

207
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,640
[Huicheng Hmm, a little
bit.] [Yayan Really?]

208
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,710
Hmm.

209
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,400
[Yayan, the scent really smells good]

210
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,700
[Huicheng, really?] [Yayan, hmm]

211
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,680
Is it a test?
Hmm.

212
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,480
[The secret conversation
time between a boy and a girl]

213
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Yup, I have.
[The secret conversation
time between a boy and a girl]

214
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,580
[The secret conversation
time between a boy and a girl]

215
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,690
That's amazing.
[The secret conversation
time between a boy and a girl]

216
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:49,755
That's amazing.

217
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:51,180
[Yayan, do you like perfume?]

218
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,569
[Huicheng, yeah, I like perfume.
Probably about... 5 of them?]

219
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,570
Me too.

220
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,049
[Huicheng, I only brought this one]

221
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,376
[Yayan, it smells really good.]
[Huicheng, really? Does it smell good?]

222
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,939
[We shared our preferences
with each other.] Very refreshing.

223
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,980
- Is that so? - Yeah.
Yeah.

224
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,210
[Huicheng, are you saying...
you're also good at knitting?]

225
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,226
[Zhenglie, Huicheng's body
is already leaning, isn't it?]

226
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,860
[Shangxun, it's a straight attack.]

227
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,990
[Huicheng, are you saying...
you're also good at knitting?]

228
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,790
[Yayan, you're not really good at
it, right? Just knitted a few scarves?]

229
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,679
[Yayan, have you been knitting consistently?]
[Huicheng, yeah, I've been knitting all along.]

230
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,690
[Yayan, every time I see it, it gets
longer.] [Huicheng, yeah, exactly.]

231
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,320
[Huicheng, I can also knit a
little while playing the piano.]

232
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,900
Really?
[Huicheng, I can also knit a
little while playing the piano.]

233
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,050
[Huicheng, I can also knit a
little while playing the piano.]

234
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,180
Yeah.
[Huicheng, I can also knit a
little while playing the piano.]

235
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,050
Yeah.

236
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,670
[Huicheng, he'll knit
whenever he has time.]

237
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,290
[Yayan, is it for Tuantuan?]

238
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,570
[Huicheng, I don't know either,
but that size... is a little small]

239
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,589
[Huicheng, do I have too
many hobbies?] [Yayan, Hmm]

240
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,120
Is that so?

241
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,300
[Yayan, it seems like
you're good at everything]
Is that so?

242
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,040
[Yayan, it seems like
you're good at everything]

243
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,530
[Huicheng, that's exactly the problem,
I don't have anything I excel at]

244
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,530
What do you mean?
[Huicheng, that's exactly the problem,
I don't have anything I excel at]

245
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,250
[Huicheng, that's exactly the problem,
I don't have anything I excel at]

246
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,690
[Yayan, isn't that what
you said is the problem?]

247
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,220
[Yayan, no, I think it's very
handsome] [Huicheng, Oh, really?]

249
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,201
[Hueicheng, shall we go
in?] [Yayan, sure, let's go!]

250
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,659
[Yayan, is this the
place?] [Hueicheng, yes]

251
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,840
[Hueicheng, here it is]
[Yayan, I'm scared again]

252
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,139
[Hueicheng, hello] [Yayan, hello]

253
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,679
Hello

254
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,289
[Hueicheng, two students...]

255
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,750
Are you two students?

256
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:27,590
[JaeJae, ah, he said two students.
I've been through that phase too]

257
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,100
[JaeJae two students]

258
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,720
[Yayan 230 millimeters...]

259
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,340
[Huicheng here needs to choose a
smaller one] [Yayan I am 230 millimeters]

260
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,910
[Yayan must be very fun] [Huicheng Hmm]

261
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,130
[Huicheng tear it open before wearing it
will be easier to put on] [Yayan Thank you]

262
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,880
[Yayan look at the difference
in the size of our feet]

263
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,580
[Huicheng now we need to choose
bowling pins(?)] [Yayan OK]

264
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,729
[Huicheng Comparatively light...]

265
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,740
[Huicheng There is a weight written
here. This one is quite light.]

266
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,450
[Yayan Is it light? Don't you
think the green one looks lighter?]

267
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,180
[Huicheng This one should be quite
heavy.] [Yayan Hmm, quite heavy.]

268
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,546
[Yayan What about this one?]
[Huicheng How many pounds is it?]

269
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,851
[Huicheng How many pounds...
8 pounds?] [Yayan 8 pounds?]

270
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,920
[Huicheng, did you play
well?] [Yayan, not good?]

271
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,530
[Yayan, you want to teach me]

272
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,159
[Huicheng, after grabbing
it, walk forward 1 2 3]

273
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
2 3

274
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,299
[Huicheng, let go. Just stretch
this side straight, straighten]

275
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,570
[Yayan, straighten it?] [Huicheng,
you can straighten it however you want]

276
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,520
[Huicheng, do you need to
fix the wrist and this side?]

277
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,080
[Yayan OK] [Huicheng Shall we try?]

278
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,000
[Huicheng Shall I go first?]

279
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,730
[Huicheng Ah, but I haven't
played in a long time]

280
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,470
[Yayan You can, you can]

281
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,929
[Yayan takes a photo of Huicheng]

282
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,500
[JaeJae Wow, you played really well]

283
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,020
[JaeJae That's why I said we
should go, right?] Yes, that's right

284
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,890
[Youqing Do you want to show it to him?]
Show your charm

285
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,610
[Shang Xun, just like
going swimming with Dong Xu]

286
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,080
- Yes, yes - Right.
[Shang Xun, just like
going swimming with Dong Xu]

287
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,610
- Yes, yes - Right.

288
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,170
[Ya Yan, hey, can you spin too?]

289
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,880
[Ya Yan, can you spin too?]

290
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,996
[Ya Yan, it feels like
it can clean the gutter]

291
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,766
[Ya Yan, can it clean the gutter?] [Hui Cheng, even if
it can clean the gutter, as long as we have fun playing]

292
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,169
[Hui Cheng, let me wipe it for
you, use this] [Ya Yan, OK, this one?]

293
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,900
[Huicheng, use this to hit.]

294
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,840
[Huicheng, how did you miss that one?]

295
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,280
[Huicheng, does the bowling ball have
consciousness?] [Yayan, that's what I'm saying.]

296
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,780
[Huicheng, come over here.]

297
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,840
[Huicheng, fix your wrist.]

298
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,660
[Huicheng, just use your arm
like this... Do you understand?]

299
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
[Yayan, because it's too heavy,
haha.] [Huicheng, oh, okay.]

300
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,580
OK

301
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,439
[Yayan is very good at teaching bowling]

302
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,280
[Yayan, although I've
been crooked and twisted]

303
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,300
[Yayan, but very happy]

304
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,010
[Huicheng, fix your wrist, right]

305
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,969
[Huicheng, look, like
this, when you lift it up]

306
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,476
[Huicheng, the direction of your
arm should be towards the center]

307
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,070
[Huicheng, you threw it like this just now,
right? So you need to throw it towards the center]

308
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,070
OK
[Huicheng, you threw it like this just now,
right? So you need to throw it towards the center]

309
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,140
[Huicheng, you threw it like this just now,
right? So you need to throw it towards the center]

310
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,420
[Huicheng, settled] [Yayan, yes]

311
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,790
[Huicheng, by the way!]

312
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,250
[Huicheng, great great great]

313
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,189
[Yayan, did I play well?]

314
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,530
[Shangxun, do you want to interlock your fingers?
Why are your fingers open? When clapping hands?]

315
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,980
[Chuu, right?]
It should be like this

316
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,090
[JaeJae, as long as one
person moves, it's like this]

317
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,370
[Hui Cheng is awesome]
[Ya Yan played well, right?]

318
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,590
[Ya Yan, but there are a few zeros now]

319
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:47,170
[Ya Yan, at first I just thought we
were good friends and got along well]

320
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,890
[The atmosphere seems
to have changed a bit]

321
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,760
[Ya Yan, when she was teaching me]

322
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,120
[Ya Yan, because I had to get closer]

323
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,660
Do you understand?

324
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,350
[Ya Yan, so at that time]

325
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,340
[It seemed like there was a bit of a crush]

326
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,100
[While teaching Yayan
to play bowling, Huicheng]

327
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,350
[Huicheng, I'm starting to
develop feelings for Yayan]

328
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,520
[I have feelings]

329
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,579
[Yayan, let's make a bet] [Huicheng,
Make a bet? Based on scores?]

330
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,600
[Yayan, what should we bet on?]

331
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,560
[Shangxun, what should we bet
on? Fulfilling each other's wishes?]

332
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,149
[Huicheng, let's go with 'fulfilling each other's
wishes'] [Yayan, Fulfilling each other's wishes?]

333
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,099
Wow... - It really is.

334
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,180
[Yayan, can you use it
anytime?] [Huicheng, mm-hmm.]

335
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,150
[Huicheng, do you need me to rate you?]

336
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,739
[Yayan, no need, no need.]
[Huicheng, no need? Just come directly?]

337
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,230
[Yayan, it's okay, it's just a bet.]

338
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,230
Should I come directly?
[Yayan, it's okay, it's just a bet.]

339
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,130
[Yayan, it's okay, it's just a bet.]

340
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,590
Okay.
[Yayan, it's okay, it's just a bet.]

341
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,890
[Yayan, should we start walking from here?]
Okay.

342
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,310
[Yayan, should we start walking from here?]

343
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,230
[Huicheng, oh!]

344
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,521
[Yayan, is this right?]
[Huicheng, very good, very good.]

345
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,086
Huicheng, you played
really well, didn't you?

346
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,530
Huicheng played very well.

347
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,930
Huicheng has knocked down
9 of them. Yayan: Very good.

348
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,330
Yayan: Wow.

349
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,120
Huicheng, you played really well, right?

350
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,009
Yayan: I always become
better whenever you teach me.

351
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,090
Yayan: You are a really good teacher.

352
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,809
Huicheng: What's the
score? Let's take a look.

353
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,500
Huicheng: It's really
fun, just 1 point left.

354
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,909
[Yayan, ah, so fun]

355
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,060
[Huicheng, ah, take a picture, take this]

356
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,270
[Huicheng wins by a difference of 1 point]

357
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,209
[Yayan, think about
your wish] [Huicheng, hmm]

358
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,819
[Yayan, ah, what a pity] [Huicheng, yes]

359
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,410
[Yayan, you know I deliberately lost to
you, right?] [Huicheng, I know, I know]

360
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,690
[Yayan, so fun] [Huicheng,
is it fun? That's great]

361
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,150
[Huicheng, luckily I brought
you along.] [Yayan, thank you.]

362
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,850
[Yayan, are your hands very
cold?] [Huicheng, not really.]

363
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,100
[Yayan, it's very warm, isn't it?]
[Huicheng, yes, I've always been warm.]

364
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,150
[Yayan, I used to be really cold, right?]

365
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,280
[Yayan, you're much better now.] [Huicheng, yes, every
time I see you, I feel like you must be very cold.]

366
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:43,560
- Really? - Yes

367
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:46,500
[Hui Cheng knows that Ya
Yan's hand is very cold]

368
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,360
[Hui Cheng, are you still
carrying this?] [Ya Yan Of course]

369
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,340
[Hui Cheng Well done]

370
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,100
[Ya Yan Isn't it cute?] [Hui Cheng Hmm]

371
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,380
Does it have a name?

372
00:31:59,381 --> 00:31:59,590
[Hang the keychain that
Hui Cheng gave on the bag]

373
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,990
It? No, you help it choose one
[Hang the keychain that
Hui Cheng gave on the bag]

374
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,220
[Hang the keychain that
Hui Cheng gave on the bag]

375
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,890
- How about calling it Pink? - OK
[Hang the keychain that
Hui Cheng gave on the bag]

376
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,250
[Hang the keychain that
Hui Cheng gave on the bag]

377
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,980
[Hui Cheng Now...]

378
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,450
[Ya Yan Let's go somewhere else?]
[Hui Cheng Hmm, let's go somewhere else]

379
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,700
[Hui Cheng It's more
interesting than imagined, right?]

380
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,200
[Ya Yan Because the teacher is
really good] [Hui Cheng Oh no~]

381
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,240
[Hui Cheng Do you want to go to a coffee shop?]
[Ya Yan Sure? I actually really want to go]

382
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,829
[Hui Cheng "Twenty-five, Twenty-one"?]

383
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,139
[Is Yayan going here?] [Huicheng Yes]

384
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,269
[Is it true, Yayan?] [Huicheng Yes]

385
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,500
[Yayan, I have always wanted to go]

386
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,830
[Huicheng We are going now] [Yayan Really?]

387
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,960
[Huicheng Do you think it's
just an ordinary cafe?] [Yayan Yes]

388
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,649
[Huicheng It's here] [Yayan
I'm a little touched, huh?]

389
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,250
[Hyeongcheong, I happened to
have the opportunity to go today.]

390
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,380
[Yayan, thank you.] [Hyeongcheong, mmhmm.]

391
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,936
[Hyeongcheong, is there anything
you want to do?] [Yayan, me?]

392
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,190
[Yayan, I want to go to a
café.] [Hyeongcheong, which one?]

393
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,190
[Yayan, the place where I took the bus,
the one in "Twenty-five, Twenty-one"...]

394
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:56,830
[Remembering the place
the girl wanted to go.]

395
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,020
Where is it?
[Remembering the place
the girl wanted to go.]

396
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,340
[Remembering the place
the girl wanted to go.]

397
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,960
Hmm, right there.
[Remembering the place
the girl wanted to go.]

398
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,240
[Remembering the place
the girl wanted to go.]

399
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,739
[Yayan, it should be here.]

400
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,120
[Yayan, wow, it's really beautiful.]

401
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,980
[Yayan, wow, it's really beautiful.]

402
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,429
[Huicheng, should we take
a picture of the outside?]

403
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,350
[Huicheng, take a picture of this scenery?]

404
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,320
[Yayan, here? Like this?]

405
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,201
[Huicheng, can you take it?]
[Yayan, yes, I can take it.]

406
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,390
[Yayan, so beautiful]

407
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,860
[Huicheng, very petite and cute]

408
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,540
[Yayan, so lovely]

409
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,609
JaeJae, ouch!
What should we do?

410
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,559
[Shangxun, oh my god, love is pouring out]

411
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,379
[Zhenglie, didn't know he has smiling eyes]
- Didn't expect - to change like this, really

412
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,769
[Zhenglie, his eyes have become like this]

413
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,570
[JaeJae, first time seeing him with this expression] "Um, nice
to meet you - really nice to meet you for the first time."

414
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,519
"[Huicheng, thank you]"
"[Yayan, thank you]"

415
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,801
"[Yayan, take a photo of
this, okay?]" "[Huicheng, sure]"

416
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,190
"[Huicheng, should I
also be in the photo?]"

417
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,230
"[Yayan, strike a pose]"

418
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,089
"[Yayan, oh? Thank you]"
"[Huicheng, please enjoy]"

419
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,720
"[Yayan, thank you]"

420
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,370
"[Yayan, how should we eat
this? Should we just...]"

421
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,550
[Huicheng Hmm? Ah, you
can't use your hands directly]

422
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,880
[Yayan Of course I know~!]

423
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,340
Are you eating?

424
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,820
[Yayan Thank you]

425
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:41,380
The salad is delicious.

426
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,440
[Huicheng After dipping it once,
it's fully coated] [Yayan Hmm]

427
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,860
[Huicheng Then you can
eat it] [Yayan Like this?]

428
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,960
[Huicheng Blow on it,
it might be a little hot]

429
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,610
[Huicheng Is it delicious?]
[Yayan Hmm, it's really delicious]

430
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,620
[Yayan has tried many
things for the first time]

431
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,570
[Yayan also has a lot of time to think]

432
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,870
[Yayan feels great]

433
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,630
[Huicheng everyone is busy
with their major] [Yayan Yeah]

434
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,340
[Huicheng Not bad, coming
to a place like this]

435
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,699
[Huicheng can also find healing]
[Yayan Yeah, I really took a good rest]

436
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,629
[Yayan Didn't I chat with
you in that room yesterday]

437
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,779
[Yayan, that time was very enjoyable]

438
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,649
[Huicheng, time passes by so quickly, right?
That time?] [Yayan, Yes, it really was fast]

439
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,539
[Yayan, I didn't expect
time to pass by so quickly]

440
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,060
[Huicheng, me too, I feel like
I can really connect with you]

441
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,800
[It's genuine, I'm very serious]

442
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,269
[Yayan, when I chat with other people]

443
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,569
[Yayan, there are often
pauses and awkward moments]

444
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,610
[Yayan, but chatting with
Huicheng is never awkward]

445
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,670
So I'm very happy

446
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:07,080
[Very happy]

447
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:12,940
[Huicheng seems to be a date that
made me have a good impression of Yayan]

448
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,290
[Yayan, are you happy today?]

449
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,760
[Huicheng: Happy! This is what I arranged]

450
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,640
[Yayan: Thanks to you, I'm
also happy] [Huicheng: Really?]

451
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,220
[Huicheng: That's great, it's
healing] [Yayan: I'm really happy]

452
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,160
[Yayan, thank you so much]
[Huicheng, you should play more]

453
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,450
Right?

454
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,180
[Huicheng, it's a bit cold,
isn't it?] [Yayan, are you cold?]

455
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,000
[Huicheng, oh, it's a bit chilly]
That's right

456
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,900
[Yayan, because of all
the coming and going]

457
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,230
[Yayan, is your intention clear?]

458
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,530
What's wrong?

459
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:59,590
[Shangxun, no, now is
just the beginning! Now]

460
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,060
[Shangxun, asking "is your intention
clear?" is just the beginning]

461
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,360
[Please give us another 500cc!]

462
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,790
[Yayan, have you made up your mind?]

463
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,770
[Yayan, have you relaxed a bit?]
[Huicheng, what about your inner thoughts?]

464
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,610
[Huicheng, what about
you?] [Yayan, what about me?]

465
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,110
[Huicheng, isn't it
time for a fresh start?]

466
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,170
[Yayan, yes, it's a fresh start.]

467
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,350
[Yayan, feeling a bit...]

468
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,229
[Yayan, I can't help but
care about what others think.]

469
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,339

[The two missed each
other by a hair's breadth.]

come out after I left?]

499
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,440
[Dongxu, I waited for you at
the door for nearly two hours.]

[Dongxu, so you came out
as soon as I left, huh?]

502
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,190

have waited a bit longer.]

503

asleep while looking at something.]

507
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,540
[Dongxu, why is it so cold...]
[Shumin, maybe you're just nervous?]

508
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:33,270
[Xiumin: When I grow up, I
want to marry someone like you]

509
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,050
[Dongxu: Why don't you just marry me?
After all, there's no one else like me]

510
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,810
[Xiumin: Should I just not go to
Germany and move directly to Gwangju?]

511

still have to do a little more to make it work

[Junrong, there should be enough chocolate,
it's too much] [Yuli, I got it, I got it]

Dongxu here?] [Junrong, yes]

519

[Huiren, they are nearby] [Junrong,
are they in the practice room?]

520
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,639
[Junrong, what if Suimin says
she's not going to Germany anymore?]

521
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,840
[Yuli, that's what I said, right?] [Huiren, no,
she always says not to go, doesn't want to go.]

522
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,200
[Junrong, can't do that, huh?] [Yuli,
can't do that, what are you doing?]

523
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,470
[Huiren, I'll go and
mediate a bit and come back.]

524
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,100

even talked about it yet.] OK, OK.

situation is a bit serious]

531

scene during our school days

[Yuri Hey, where is she? Is it far?]

627
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,940
[Yuri Yagyeon~ Yagyeon~ so curious~]

628
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,799
[Huiren Where did she go? Oh?
Over there!] [Yuri Oh? It's her.]

629
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,170
It must be her.

630
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,850
[Found Yagyeon taking a walk]

631
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,710
[Yuri Yagyeon!]

632
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,740

633
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,900
[Yuli, Yayan~ Yayan~ Yayan yes~]

634
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,459
[Yuli, how are you... How's
it going?] [Yayan, I'm good.]

635
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,970
[Huiren, are you having fun?]

636
00:50:41,971 --> 00:50:43,009
It's obvious

637
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,600
[Huiren, let's talk while walking]
Let's hear it

638
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:44,860
Do you still want to take a walk?
[Huiren, let's talk while walking]
Let's hear it

639
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,480
Do you still want to take a walk?

640
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:45,640
[Curious about many things,
born in 2006, same age]

641
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,056
I still want to take a leisurely stroll
[Curious about many things,
born in 2006, same age]

642
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:47,080
[Curious about many things,
born in 2006, same age]

643
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,660
But I have two words for you...
[Curious about many things,
born in 2006, same age]

644
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,140
[Curious about many things,
born in 2006, same age]

645
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,060
[Yuri, how does it feel when
you two talk? Are you happy?]

646
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,340
[Yayan, it's very relaxing and...]

647
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,670
What does it feel like?

648
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:01,030
[Yayan, I've always wanted to ask him if
he has decided on the person he likes...]

649
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,809
[Huiren, what? What did you
say?] [Yuri, what did you say?]

650
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:08,010
[Yayan, "Didn't you say you reset everything starting from yesterday?
Have you made up your mind?" I suddenly asked him like this]

651
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,060
[You what, Yuli? What's wrong with
you?] [Huiren, I'm falling in love~!]

652
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,989
[Yayan, then he suddenly said, "I
think I know now too."] He said like that.

653
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,799
[Yayan, but I don't know if the person
he likes is me or not.] It's not like that.

654
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,409
[Yuli, in that situation, if it wasn't you,
he would say, "I'm not really sure either."]

655
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,250
That's right, that's right.

656
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,299
[Yuli, you're super...
since you first came over!]

657
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,500
[Yuri, you haven't let go of the corners
of your mouth, cheekbones, cheekbones!]

658
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,680
[Yayoung, run in circles!!!]

659
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,000
She really...

660
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,130
Go back, Yayoung.

661
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,650
Yayoung.

662
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,460
- Impressive. - Really impressive.

663

670
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:30,699
[After chatting a lot, having the opportunity to go out together
and get to know each other better, today was really great]

671
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,670
[A friend of the opposite sex who wants to make a
wish list with me, and also with questions for girls]

672
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:49,079
[After careful consideration,
the girl wrote down a name]

[A friend of the opposite sex who wants to make a wish list with me, Hui
Cheng For the first time, wrote down the name of another teenage boy]

674
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:01,829
[Ya Yan, when we went on a farm date,
it felt like I kept summoning up courage]

675
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,599
[When Yayan is with Huicheng]

676
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,300
[Yayan can feel that Huicheng
is also gathering courage]

677
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,299
[Yayan, you go over there]
[Huicheng: What? Take that first]

678
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,640
[Yayan: Take it?] [Huicheng:
Just take the cow...]

679
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,380
[A girl getting close to a young boy]

680
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,170
[Huicheng: I'll help you take it]

681

[Yayan remembers everything
he said in conversation]

[Yayan then made plans based on those]

687
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,599

there?] [Hui Cheng Yes]

[Yayan, thank him for taking care of me]

694
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,850
[Huicheng, my wrist is fixed] [Yayan, hmm]

695
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,419
[Huicheng, only the arm is
like this... do you understand?]

696
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,319
[Yayan also listened to me attentively]

went to the bowling alley?]

701
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,210
[Yayan, our bet was to
fulfill each other's wishes]

702
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,779
[Yayan, but I lost by one point]

703
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,579
[Huiren, you have to
win! If you win, tell him]

704
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,579
[Huiren, "Date me"] [Yayan, what?
I'm actually curious about his wish]

705
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,889
[Yayan, I wonder what his wish is...]
[Huiren, is it still not time yet?]

706
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,489
[Yayeon hasn't used it yet] [But
Yoo Lee, that way it's even better]

day? After the final choice?]

708
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,090
[Hui In: Can I say my wish now?]

00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,479
[Yuri, what should we do now,
Yayun ah? Yajian sister is here now~!]

715
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,400
[Huiren, wait a moment, we haven't accompanied
Yayun for a walk yet.] [Yajian, let's go this way!]

[Yajian, but I also don't
understand his heart...]

718
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,959
[Huiren, do we understand?] [Yuri, I
think I kinda understand?] Is that true?

719
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,389
[What is Yayan?]

720
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,659
[Why Yayan? Where did you hear that from?]

721
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,529
[Yuri: Hmm~ just knew it]
[Yayan, did you hear something?]

722
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,270
[Huiren: We didn't hear
anything, we don't know anything]

723

I don't know.
[Huiren: We didn't hear
anything, we don't know anything]

724
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:15,960
I don't know.

725
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:17,430
[What is it, Yayan?]

726
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
[Huiren: What should I
do...] [Yuri: You already have]

727
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,969
What happened?
[Huiren: What should I
do...] [Yuri: You already have]

that he won't come!]

730

[Youli will come] [Yayan will come]

731
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,979
[Huirun, because if I make a mistake, I will
keep sighing... But didn't he say it's okay?]

732
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,009
[Youli, you need someone like that,
always by your side, helping you...]

733
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,620
[Youli, oh, really]

734
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,589
[Yayan, what about you, Youli?]
[Youli, me? It's not me...]

735
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,789
[Yayan, are you a member
of the Minjian Party?]

736
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,020
[Yuli, no, uh-hahaha, feed him~!]
[Huiren, isn't your intuition too poor?]

737
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,430
[Yayan, what's wrong? Is
it completely unrelated?]

738
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,959
[On the third day, in the girls' dormitory]

739
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,530
[Yayan, Yuli~]
Yes

740
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,029
[Yayan, do you have a better
understanding of your feelings now?]

741
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,179
[Yuli, speaking of which, I've
been thinking about this on the bus]

742
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,180
Me too.

743
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,149
[Yuri, I really don't know.] [Yayan,
Really? You still don't know now?]

744
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,980
What about me?

745
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:03,849
[Yayan, don't you have anyone you're even slightly
curious about or have a good feeling for?]

746
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:07,350
[Yuri, I'm curious about
everyone, but right now...]

747
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,489
[Yuri, I feel the most comfortable around Junrong brother.]
[Yayan, Yes, me too.] Yes, me too. I'm like that too.

748
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,389
[Yuri It's very interesting to chat...]

749
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,889
[Yuri But Chengyun is really just]

750
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,465
[Yuri Since our last chat]

751
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:18,510
-Very -Hmm

Different
[Yuri Very... very different]

754
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:20,390

Very different
[Yuri Very... very different]

756
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:21,360
[Yuri Very... very different]

757
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,929
[Yuri I'm also curious about Dongxu]

758
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,400
[Yuri Because we haven't really talked]

759
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,130
That's right
[Yuri Because we haven't really talked]

760
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:26,400
That's right

761
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,169
[Yuri So when I chat with everyone]

762
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:35,079
[Yuri Other people probably know that this person is
my type And continue to get to know him, but only me]

763
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,879
[Yuri Every time we chat, it feels
like we click and our personalities match]

764
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,189
[Yuri Standards are not clear... I
can't judge my own standards either]

765
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:48,490
[Yuri Among actors, idols, and celebrities
To be honest, I don't have an ideal type]

766
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,089
[I don't know]

767
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,850
I don't know either
[I don't know x2]

768
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,675
[I don't know X3]

769
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:57,430
I really don't know my own heart

770
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:58,829
[I don't know X4]

771
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:02,539
[I don't know X5]
But I really don't understand well

772
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:07,039
[Yoongi really can't understand...
it's really confusing...]

773
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,880
[Yoongi is too much...]

774
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,960
[A little recording of Yoongi's
complicated inner thoughts]

775
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,340
[Please draw your inner thoughts]

776
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,190
[Hahaha, who should I like?]

777
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:04,460
[The weather inside my heart is entangled and complicated Ah, what should I do if it really becomes
more and more complicated...? Sigh, I'm so tired, really, I don't understand my own heart at all]

778
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,879
[Yuri, this person is a friend, do I
have a slight fondness for this person?]

779
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,110
[Yuri, the boundaries of
these things are very blurry...]

780
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,419
[Yuri, I can't really differentiate them]

781
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,589
[Yuri, so I'm also a bit...
Oh, do I like this person?]

782
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,920
[Yuri or just as friends?]

783
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:33,009
[Yuri, so now I really
don't understand my feelings]

784
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,020
Yes

785
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:35,900
[Yajin, is your intuition
bad? Jun Rong gege?]

786
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,999
[Yuri, but, it's not, but]

787
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,320
[Yuri, I feel very comfortable with Jun
Rong gege, but today seems a bit different]

788
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:51,050
[Jun Rong, aren't you done
with baking now?] [Yuri, end]

789
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,050
[Joon Young, continue baking!]

790
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,190
Take it away.

791
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,770
What the heck.

792
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,659
[Yoo Ri, to be honest, because when I'm with Joon Young, we
just laugh and joke around, so I don't really know him well?]

793
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,460
[Yoo Ri, but after chatting with him today, I
feel...] [Ya Yan, does it feel different to you?]

794
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,269
[Yoo Ri, he feels different to me.
Very good. Makes me feel comfortable.]

795
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:18,610
[Yuri, so I plan to talk
to him again tomorrow]

796
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,949
[Huiren, ah, I think it's very interesting when girls chat
together] [Yuri, ah, I also think so! Why are we so cute]

797
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,679
[We also think so. We also
think so. We also think so!!]

798
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:26,920
[Shangxun, we also think it's very
interesting when girls chat together]

799
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,920
I also think so
[Shangxun, we also think it's very
interesting when girls chat together]

800
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,040
[Shangxun, we also think it's very
interesting when girls chat together]

801
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,040
Very interesting
[Shangxun, we also think it's very
interesting when girls chat together]

802
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,450
[Shangxun, we also think it's very
interesting when girls chat together]

803
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,559
[Yu Li, a sweet and blissful unrequited love] [Ya Yan, our
conversation between 06s? It's the most interesting, right?]

804
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,060
[Yu Li, we are so adorable, 06s~]

805
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:38,340
[Ya Yan, ah... I really... No, what should I do,
after my sister comes back, what should I say...]

806
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,420
-Ah, I really -What?
[Ya Yan, ah... I really... No, what should I do,
after my sister comes back, what should I say...]

807
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:41,650
[Ya Yan, ah... I really... No, what should I do,
after my sister comes back, what should I say...]

808
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,840
-No, what should I do -What happened
[Ya Yan, ah... I really... No, what should I do,
after my sister comes back, what should I say...]

809
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,060
[Ya Yan, ah... I really... No, what should I do,
after my sister comes back, what should I say...]

810
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:44,530
What should I say after my sister comes back? [Youli, it's
nothing.] [Huiren, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing.]
[Ya Yan, ah... I really... No, what should I do,
after my sister comes back, what should I say...]

811
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,146
What should I say after my sister comes back? [Youli, it's
nothing.] [Huiren, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing.]

812
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,400
[Youli, well... it's not a secret, there's no need
to deliberately say it, you know what I mean, right?]

813
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,760
That's right.
Here... I mean, yeah.
[Youli, well... it's not a secret, there's no need
to deliberately say it, you know what I mean, right?]

814
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,950
[Youli, well... it's not a secret, there's no need
to deliberately say it, you know what I mean, right?]

815
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:51,310
I did this today, did that, did this.
[Youli, well... it's not a secret, there's no need
to deliberately say it, you know what I mean, right?]

816
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:52,870
I did this today, did that, did this.

817
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,540
[Huiren, if the two people are already dating, there
might be a little problem, but isn't it still early?]

818
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:56,910
Yes, that's right.
[Huiren, if the two people are already dating, there
might be a little problem, but isn't it still early?]

819
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:57,540
Yes, that's right.

820
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:03,019
[Yayan: Because I know that Lianyuan sister
likes him, I know she really likes him...]

821
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,289
[Yayan: And I get along
well with Huicheng too.]

822
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,219
[Yayan: But Huicheng told me...]

823
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,660
[Yayan: He is not sure if
he has feelings for me, so...]

824
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:16,400
[I have thought a lot because
I feel sorry for her...]

825
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,929
[Shangxun: That's true... the person
involved is also having a hard time.]

826
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,150
[Shangxun, because their relationship
is the closest, Liyuan and Yayan]

827
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:21,500
- That's right - That's right
[Shangxun, because their relationship
is the closest, Liyuan and Yayan]

828
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,070
- That's right - That's right

829
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:23,340
[Youqing, that's right...]

830
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:30,810
[With complex emotions,
welcomed the sunset of the day]

831
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:43,090
[Liyuan is back]

832
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,270
[Liyuan, oh dear, so tired...]

833
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:00,780
[Yayan, oh?]

834
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,880
[Huicheng, what's wrong?]

835
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,330
What's wrong?

836
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,340
My nose hurts

837
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
- Liyuan - My nose hurts

838
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,660
Where did you just go, sister?

839
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:17,130
[Dongxu, sister, where did you just
go?] [Li Yuan, is it me? It's a secret.]

840
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,129
Secret.

841
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,699
[Li Yuan, go to the little
rest area, I bought a gift.]

842
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,499
[Dongxu, it's so quiet here because
sister is not here.] [Li Yuan, really?]

843
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,140
[Li Yuan, it's a Seoul's sweet donut.]

844
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,440
[Li Yuan, go to the little rest area.]
- Let's go to the lounge. - Okay.

845
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,840
[Yayan, did you arrive smoothly?]
Hmm.

846
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,050
Where did you go?

847
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,860
- Where did you go?
- I went to take a university exam.

848
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,760
Really?

849
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,390
[When Yayan sister came back,
my feelings were complicated.]

850
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:47,910
[Although I understand Liyuan's feelings,
my liking for Huicheng keeps increasing.]

851
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,230
Because even though I clearly knew my
sister's feelings, it turned out this way.
[Although I understand Liyuan's feelings,
my liking for Huicheng keeps increasing.]

852
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:52,430
[Although I understand Liyuan's feelings,
my liking for Huicheng keeps increasing.]

853
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:57,570
[Yayan felt sorry... but didn't
know what to do at the moment]

854
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,859
[Just avoided her...]

855
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,180
- Did you buy something? - Yeah, donuts.

856
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,740
It hurts so much.

857
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,950
[Junrong Wow~ Mom is back]

858
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,859
[Yayan Welcome]

859
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,220
[Junrong Since you're here,
can you help me trim my bangs?]

860
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,359
[Junrong Push the bangs to both sides]

861
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,170
[Junrong, very good! Just like this]

862
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,610
It really hurts.

863
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:45,680
[Yayan sits farthest away from Liyuan.]

864
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:54,620
[Liyuan, what did you do
today?] [Huirun, what about us?]

865
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,959
[Huirun went to the supermarket and
fried pork belly when she came back.]

866
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,060
[Liyuan, it must be delicious.
I heard you had some free time?]

867
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,960
[Liyuan, are you crying?] [Yayan, just now I drank carbonated
drinks and it came out of my nose. It hurts so much...]

868
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,300
No, it's a carbonated beverage.
[Liyuan, are you crying?] [Yayan, just now I drank carbonated
drinks and it came out of my nose. It hurts so much...]

869
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,690
[Liyuan, are you crying?] [Yayan, just now I drank carbonated
drinks and it came out of my nose. It hurts so much...]

870
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:27,689
[Li Yuan, I really had no thoughts of drawing when I
was taking the exam, I only thought about you all].

871
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,560
[Ya Yan, what is it...]
[Hui Ren, oh wow, so touched]

872
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:31,840
But it's true.

873
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,670
[Xiu Min, sister, I miss you]

874
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,610
[Li Yuan, ah, I'm in such a good mood]

875
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,590
[Li Yuan, how is the atmosphere today?]

876
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,129
[Li Yuan, I'm most curious about
Huicheng] [Hui Ren, Huicheng?]

877
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:08,499
[Li Yuan, he seems reluctant to talk about
his inner thoughts] [You Li, Huicheng?]

878
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,940
[Hui Ren, Huicheng's inner world is
indeed the most difficult to understand]

879
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,700
That's right
[Hui Ren, Huicheng's inner world is
indeed the most difficult to understand]

880
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:10,940
That's right

881
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:15,469
[Li Yuan, who would he write as his favorite
opposite-sex friend... I'm very curious]

882
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,090
- Favorite opposite-sex friend? - Hmm

883
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,410
-No matter who it is, right? -Hmm
[Li Yuan directly expressed
what was in her heart]

884
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:21,940
[Li Yuan directly expressed
what was in her heart]

885
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,130
Up until now

886
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,809
[Ya Yan just silently listened]

887
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,010
It was just me earlier, right?

888
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,690
[Li Yuan, to be honest, even after I leave here, if
I still have feelings for him, I plan to date him]

889
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:36,019
[Youli, really?] [Li Yuan, he needs to understand
my feelings in order for us to be together]

890
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,029
[Youli, how does it feel when
you chat? Do you get along?]

891
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:42,860
[Li Yuan: I don't know what Liang
Huicheng is thinking in his heart, really]

892
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,229
[Li Yuan: Apart from Huicheng,
I took photos with everyone]

893
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,440
[Li Yuan: I couldn't
approach him because I was shy]

894
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,990
- That kind of mentality - Hmm

895
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,130
But strangely enough, I
might also be like that

896
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:55,109
[Xiumin: Sister Yayan, what
are you thinking?] [Yayan: Me?]

897
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:58,539
[Yanyan, you look troubled today.]
[Yanyan, no, I'm just lost in thought...]

898
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:01,820
- Maybe it's because you're thinking about someone.
- What are you talking about?

899
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,316
- So you feel settled because of someone?
- Are you thinking about Junrong?

900
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,800
Showing signs of a crush.

901
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,020
It seems like I know what it is.

902
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:08,860
[Xiumin, could you turn off a few lights?]

903
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,400
[Liyuan, why does no one know what
Huicheng is up to?] [Yuli, Huicheng?]

904
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:22,440
[Li Yuan was curious
about the young boy's day.]

905
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,770
[Yoo Ri, talk to her about the
bowling game with Hui Cheng.]

906
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,680
[Speak softly.]

907
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,950
[Peep.]

908
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,150
[Yoo Ri, let me handle this.]

909
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,519
[Yoo Ri, but today... it's a bit...]

910
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:42,159
[Yoo Ri, Min Jeong, Min Ji, and
Hui Jin are staying here with me.]

911
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,130
[Yoo Ri, the two of them are crying.]

912
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:45,260
- So, that's right.

913
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:51,730
[Yoo Ri, what did you do with Hui Cheng... Did you go
bowling with Yae Yeon? After playing, did you come back?]

914
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:58,170
[It was mentioned that Huicheng
and Yayan went on a date.]

915
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,959
[Li Yuan, is today a random pairing?]
[Youli, no, it's just free time.]

916
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,600
[Li Yuan, so only Yayan and Huicheng
went on the date? No one else went?]

917
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,300
[Yayan... Hmm]

918
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,580
[Li Yuan feels a bit uneasy.]

919
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:43,150
[Li Yuan, Huicheng... and Yayan...]

920
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:47,420
[Li Yuan is worried that they might progress
too smoothly, feeling a bit uneasy.]

921
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,990
[Li Yuan is also a bit worried...]

922
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:54,470
[The two girls are the
closest in the headquarters]

923
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,800
- Hold on - Let's go
[The two girls are the
closest in the headquarters]

924
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:55,960
[The two girls are the
closest in the headquarters]

925
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,960
- Like this - Let's go
[The two girls are the
closest in the headquarters]

926
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,400
[The two girls are the
closest in the headquarters]

1081
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,460
[Huicheng, I can make spaghetti!]

1082
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,560
- Spaghetti? - Yeah
[Liyuan must be delicious.]

1083
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,890
[Huicheng, it looks like I
have to do it once, right?]

1084
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,639
[Then, a wish that Liyuan generated.]

1085
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:24,080
[I want to try Huicheng's spaghetti...]

1086
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,480
[Liyuan's wish came true.]

1087
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,050
[Dongxu, what's on the menu today?]

1088
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:32,240
- What? - What's on the menu today?

1089
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:39,130
[Huicheng, I go by instinct. I decide how
to cook based on the taste at that time.]

1090
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:44,230
[Li Yuan Well then, I'm looking forward to
it. You're so confident in making pasta.]

1091
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:47,600
[Li Yuan I'll do it.] [Dong Xu Mhmm]

1092
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,900
Okay.

1093
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:52,380
[Li Yuan naturally helps
Hui Cheng with cooking]

1094
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,740
The soup is getting less and less.
[Li Yuan naturally helps
Hui Cheng with cooking]

1095
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,740
[Li Yuan naturally helps
Hui Cheng with cooking]

1096
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,750
Getting angry.

1097
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,989
[Hui Cheng Ah, so spicy.] [Li
Yuan Spicy? What should we do then?]

1098
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,790
[Hui Cheng Just pick
out the chili peppers.]

1099
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:20,300
[Liyuan, try the food made by your older brother. If it's not
delicious, let me know.] [Xiumin: It doesn't look delicious.]

1100
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,370
I will help you make it again.
[Liyuan, try the food made by your older brother. If it's not
delicious, let me know.] [Xiumin: It doesn't look delicious.]

1101
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:21,500
I will help you make it again.

1102
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,670
[Huicheng: Have you just eaten?]

1103
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:28,780
[Liyuan: I don't think
so.] [Xiumin: No, I haven't.]

1104
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:28,810
Oh, you haven't eaten.
[Liyuan: I don't think
so.] [Xiumin: No, I haven't.]

1105
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:29,390
Oh, you haven't eaten.

1106
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,540
[Xiumin: Didn't you ask me?]
[Huicheng: I did ask you.]

1107
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:31,650
That's what I'm saying.
[Xiumin: Didn't you ask me?]
[Huicheng: I did ask you.]

1108
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:31,740
That's what I'm saying.

1109
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:37,250
[Huicheng So, could you help me fetch a
plate?] [Xiumin I don't want to, though.]

1110
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,300
Well then, I...
[Xiumin Uh-uh-uh...!]

1111
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:44,510
[Xiumin Do you want to eat?] [Huicheng
Could you fetch me a plate from there?]

1112
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,330
[Huicheng Is this how you treat me?]

1113
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,539
[Huicheng Go ahead and try
it] [Youli Wow, impressive!]

1114
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,210
[Yuri, let's go out.]

1115
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,310
[Yayan, is it delicious?]
[Xiumin, delicious.]

1116
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,649
[Yayan, Xiumin also says it's
delicious, so it must be really delicious.]

1117
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:04,850
[Huicheng, you said it doesn't look
delicious, but you cooked it that way.]

1118
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:06,310
It's true.
[Huicheng, you said it doesn't look
delicious, but you cooked it that way.]

1119
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,560
[Huicheng, you said it doesn't look
delicious, but you cooked it that way.]

1120
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,970
- How is that possible? - Delicious.
[Huicheng, you said it doesn't look
delicious, but you cooked it that way.]

1121
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:09,980
[Huicheng, you said it doesn't look
delicious, but you cooked it that way.]

1122
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:14,270
[LiYuan, I also want to take a bite.]

1123
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,860
[Finally tasted the
spaghetti cooked by Huicheng.]

1124
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,080
Come over here.

1125
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:27,530
[Li Yuan: Mhmm~]

1126
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,639
[Xiu Min: Are there sand in clams?]

1127
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,200
[Hui Cheng: Really?] [Xiu Min: Mhmm]

1128
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:32,340
-But I didn't do it. -What should we do?
[Hui Cheng: Really?] [Xiu Min: Mhmm]

1129
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,640
-But I didn't do it. -What should we do?

1130
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:33,860
[Hui Ren: Getting angry at her brother]
-But I didn't do it. -What should we do?

1131
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:34,610
[Hui Ren: Getting angry at her brother]

1132
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:36,539
[Hui Cheng: Actually, I didn't do
it] [Hui Ren: The princess is angry]

1133
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,110
[Li Yuan: Frowning] [Hui Cheng:
Actually, I didn't do it (?)].

1134
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:40,550
Please enjoy your meal.

1135
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,250
[Xiumin, older brother, this is a
bit greasy. There is too much oil.]
Please enjoy your meal.

1136
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,870
[Xiumin, older brother, this is a
bit greasy. There is too much oil.]

1137
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:43,080
- Really? - Mhm.
[Xiumin, older brother, this is a
bit greasy. There is too much oil.]

1138
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:43,870
- Really? - Mhm.

1139
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,866
[Huicheng, you should have
said after we finished eating.]

1140
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:49,219
[Xiumin, I think I can make it even tastier,
right?] [Huicheng, you can try making it next time.]

1141
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,460
[Xiumin, sure.]

1142
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,810
[Yuli, yo~]

1143
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:12,010
[Yuli, I also want to learn. I really
have confidence that I can learn it well.]

1144
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,280
[Dongxu, keep stepping
on it] [Yuli, okay, okay]

1145
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,520
[Start taking Dongxu's jazz drum class]
Move your feet while kicking

1146
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,889
[Su-min, don't just focus on
playing the drums, call them here too]

1147
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,459
[Hui-ren, go pick them up] [Su-min, ah, no]

1148
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,900
[Helpless Su-min]

1149
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:30,620
[Xiumin, bring Liu Dongxu here.]

1150
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,620
Hurry up and go.
[Xiumin, bring Liu Dongxu here.]

1151
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:31,680
[Xiumin, bring Liu Dongxu here.]

1152
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,700
- Ah, bring Liu Dongxu here. Liu Dongxu.
- What for?
[Xiumin, bring Liu Dongxu here.]

1153
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:32,950
[Huicheng, not planning to
gather up courage?] [Xiumin, hmm?]
- Ah, bring Liu Dongxu here. Liu Dongxu.
- What for?

1154
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,769
[Huicheng, not planning to
gather up courage?] [Xiumin, hmm?]

1155
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:36,416
[Huicheng, not planning to
gather up courage?] [Xiumin, why?]

1156
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,400
[Huicheng, do you want to go by yourself?]

1157
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:40,139
[Xiumin, why?] [Huicheng,
are you waiting for him?]

1158
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,901
[Xiumin, what's the matter? He
wants to come over by himself, right?]

1159
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:46,940
[Dongxu thinks the jazz
drum is very interesting.]

1160
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,980
Oh, that's it, that's it...
[Dongxu thinks the jazz
drum is very interesting.]

1161
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:49,320
[Dongxu thinks the jazz
drum is very interesting.]

1162
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,050
[Huicheng, hey, this is so
cute!] [Xiumin, thank you.]

1163
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,019
[Huicheng, what?] [Xiumin, thank you.]

1164
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,360
[Huicheng, OK.]

1165
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:03,880
[Xiumin, tell Liu Dongxu that Huicheng said I'm cute,
how about that?] [Huirenn, got it. I'll go tell him.]

1166
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,870
Okay.
[Xiumin, tell Liu Dongxu that Huicheng said I'm cute,
how about that?] [Huirenn, got it. I'll go tell him.]

1167
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:04,880
Okay.

1168
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,439
[Huiren, do you want to go
together?] [Xiumin, you go, sister.]

1169
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,320
[Huiren, I'll come back after I tell him.]
Okay.

1170
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:15,340
[The mission to stir
up jealousy has begun.]

1171
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,945
When kicking, move your foot away.

1172
01:18:17,946 --> 01:18:20,850
[Huiren, Dongxu, Huicheng
said Xiumin is cute.]

1173
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,619
[Junrong, you're in big trouble.] [Yuli, hurry up
and go. You need to take action. You should go.]

1174
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,689
[Everyone is working together]
- Take this - How can you say that

1175
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:31,389
[Huiren didn't actually say she is cute,
but commented "cute" when seeing ice cream]

1176
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,650
[Huiren, but Suimin replied with
"thank you"] [Yuri, what do you mean?]

1177
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:33,730
- Can you say that? - You really are
[Huiren, but Suimin replied with
"thank you"] [Yuri, what do you mean?]

1178
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:34,330
- Can you say that? - You really are

1179
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:35,300
[Dongxu's voice became louder]
- Can you say that? - You really are

1180
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:35,610
[Dongxu's voice became louder]

1181
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,660
It was Suimin who answered like that
[Dongxu's voice became louder]

1182
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:36,910
[Dongxu, you are spreading false information. It's really
frustrating.] [Yuli, he was really jealous just now.]
It was Suimin who answered like that

1183
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,536
[Dongxu, you are spreading false information. It's really
frustrating.] [Yuli, he was really jealous just now.]

1184
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,270
No, it was Suimin who said that, sis.

1185
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,446
- Dongxu, with Dongxu...
- It's really jealousy-inducing.

1186
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:43,370
[Dongxu, I'm not jealous.]
[Yuli, you were jealous.]

1187
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,869
No, I wasn't. No.
[Dongxu, I'm not jealous.]
[Yuli, you were jealous.]

1188
01:18:44,869 --> 01:18:44,870
[Dongxu, I'm not jealous.]
[Yuli, you were jealous.]

1189
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:48,286
[Dongxu doesn't have any jealousy towards Huicheng.]
Let me tell you, Huicheng said she is cute.

1190
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:52,349
[Huiren, Xiumin, why don't you come and let your older brother
teach you how to play jazz drums?] [Xiumin: Ah, how annoying.]

1191
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,820
[He says it's annoying,
but finishes it in one bite.]

1192
01:18:59,020 --> 01:18:59,840
[Huiren: Dongxu is jealous.]
[Xiumin: What about it?]

1193
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,050
Who is it?
[Huiren: Dongxu is jealous.]
[Xiumin: What about it?]

1194
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,690
[Huiren: Dongxu is jealous.]
[Xiumin: What about it?]

1195
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:08,400
[Xiumin regained her smile.]

1196
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,799
I thought it was something else.

1197
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,729
[Xiumin: Sister, let's go learn
jazz drums?] [Yayan: You should go.]

1198
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:13,760
[Xiumin: No, I won't go alone.]
[Huiren: Sister, I'll accompany you.]

1199
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,760
Xiumin: You go.
[Xiumin: No, I won't go alone.]
[Huiren: Sister, I'll accompany you.]

1200
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,240
[Xiumin: No, I won't go alone.]
[Huiren: Sister, I'll accompany you.]

1201
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:23,410
[Dongxu and Xiumin finally meet.]

1202
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,030
Hurry, let's go.

1203
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,730
Let's sing.
[Dongxu: Over there.]

1204
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,685
Brother, sing once.

1205
01:19:36,686 --> 01:19:39,310
[Xiumin: Yesterday, I found a super
beautiful photo.] [Dongxu: What?]

1206
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,190
Got it, got it
[Xiumin: Yesterday, I found a super
beautiful photo.] [Dongxu: What?]

1207
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:40,310
Got it, got it

1208
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,969
[Dongxu, where is this?]
[Xiumin, did you take it well?]

1209
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:46,029
[Dongxu, surprisingly good-looking]

1210
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:49,470
[Dongxu in Xiumin's super beautiful photo]

1211
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:20,140
Give it to me, how do I bite into this

1212
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,610
This is how you eat it

1213
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,340
[Minjian, oh, you're back, Seonyun is back]

1214
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,340
This is
[Minjian, oh, you're back, Seonyun is back]

1215
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,590
[Minjian, oh, you're back, Seonyun is back]

1216
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,180
Seonyun is back

1217
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:41,540
[Huicheng, Seonyun is back] [Junrong,
pan-fried beef, pan-fried beef]

1218
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,960
- Fry beef Fry beef - Chengyun
[Huicheng, Seonyun is back] [Junrong,
pan-fried beef, pan-fried beef]

1219
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:43,970
- Fry beef Fry beef - Chengyun

1220
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:47,190
[Huirenyie, what's going on? Is
the injury on your face healed?]

1221
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:47,360
You come in from this side
[Huirenyie, what's going on? Is
the injury on your face healed?]

in with a little OK plaster]

[Chengyun not injured...]

1299
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,920
[Chengyun just... life
will not go as planned]

1300
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,130

would cry. But no one cried at all.]

[Hui Ren, is Seong Yun not coming today?]

1325
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:28,099
[Hui Ren, Seong Yun will really come,
right? Because Hwi Sung hasn't arrived yet.]

1326
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,740
Seong Yun will come back tomorrow, right?

1327
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:30,100
[Hui Ren spent the whole
day looking for Seong Yun.]

1328
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,370
Because Seong Yun brother is not here.

[Huireon hasn't seen Dada since you left]

1334
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,440
[Seonyun, really? Why?]
[Huireon, Dada is not here anymore]

1335

[Huiren, really cute to
the point of speechlessness]

1345

let's think of something fun to do]

[Junrong, connect it to play music, ok?]

1351
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,560
Wait a moment.

1352
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:05,220
- Brother, don't stand there.
- Give it to me, give it to me.

1353
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,679
[Huicheng, can you play a song?]

1354
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,520
[Junrong, if your ear
hurts, just say it, ok?]

1355
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:12,350
[Huiren, give it to me, give it to me.]

1360
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,889
[Hui Ren, big brother, can you speak louder?] [Jun
Rong, can you hear me?] I can't hear anything.
