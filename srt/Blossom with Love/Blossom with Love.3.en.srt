00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,070
6 o'clock in the morning

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,390
Liyuan is hungry

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:15,900
The girl woke up early

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,120
Feeling a little hungry
The girl woke up early

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,180
The girl woke up early

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,270
Hmm, I'm hungry
The girl woke up early

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,440
The girl woke up early

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,830
Liyuan, but to be honest, I
dreamt of Huicheng just now

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,110
Yayan, what? Liyuan: It's not, but...

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,210
Liyuan: No, don't give it
any meaning Yuli: But wait...

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,940
Yuli: Sister, who did you give the keychain to?
Liyuan: Huicheng... Who did my sister give it to?

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,340
Huicheng.
Yuli: Sister, who did you give the keychain to?
Liyuan: Huicheng... Who did my sister give it to?

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,390
Huicheng.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:31,580
Yuli, did you give it
to Huicheng? Liyuan: Mmm.
Huicheng.

15
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,270
Yuli, did you give it
to Huicheng? Liyuan: Mmm.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
May I ask who it is?

17
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,330
The night that made a
young girl's heart flutter.

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,050
Yayan: Here, this is for you~

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,370
Yuli: Hey, here's a gift
for you. Chengyun: Me???

20
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,560
- Is it me? - Mmm.
Yuli: Hey, here's a gift
for you. Chengyun: Me???

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:43,800
- Is it me? - Mmm.

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,640
Yuli and Yayan gave
the keychain to Chengyun.

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,460
Speak softly, speak softly.
Yuli and Yayan gave
the keychain to Chengyun.

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,970
Yuli and Yayan gave
the keychain to Chengyun.

25
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Is this okay?

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,520
Here you go.

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,420
Liyuan then gave the keychain to Huicheng.

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,710
Xiumin, what's this?

29
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,110
Dongxu, what's up?

30
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,680
Xiumin then gave the keychain to Dongxu.

31
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,790
Liyuan gave it to him~

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,990
Liyuan, ah ah ah >_<

33
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,110
Yayan (in a dream) did something?

34
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,920
Liyuan, Huicheng said,
"Your eyes are so big" hahaha

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,570
Yayan: So, basically, you are praising
me, right? Liyuan: Yeah, you praised me.

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,690
Yayan: It's really exciting!

37
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,150
- It's really exciting! - Anyway...
Yayan: It's really exciting!

38
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,820
- It's really exciting! - Anyway...

39
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:28,440
Liyuan: Chengyun is like a child to me.

40
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,830
Yayan: That's why I find it cute.

41
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,996
Yayan: (Chengyun) occasionally
shows unexpectedly cute sides.

42
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,890
Liyuan: Exactly, it's really unexpected.

43
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,330
Yoli, it's really unexpected.

44
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,470
Yayan, I think this is
very good, really cute.

45
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,600
Liyuan, but I was originally a sunflower type that goes
straight forward. Yayan, I'm a little bit like that too.

46
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,550
Softly moved by the girl.

47
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,850
Boy's dormitory.

48
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,256
Huicheng, can we eat now? Chengyun,
I don't know, I want to eat too.

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,710
Huicheng, I can't stand it anymore.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,360
The boys immediately go straight to instant
noodles as soon as they open their eyes.

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,506
Huicheng, why is this so delicious?
Chengyun: That's right, it really is.

52
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,610
Huicheng, I'm almost
crying... It's so delicious.

53
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,880
Liyuan: Hi.

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,320
After last night's awkward first meeting after
exchanging keychains, it was really awkward.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,896
Youqing: Yayan showed what
Seunghoon mentioned last time.

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,996
- To see it twice, as said before.
- Yes, see it twice. Youqing: "To see it twice" as mentioned before.

57
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,206
I usually just call it "seeing it twice."
Shang Xun, I usually call him "watch twice"...

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,070
This is watching it twice.

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,880
Ya Yan, do you only drink banana milk?

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,560
Cheng Yun, because I already ate
instant noodles in the dormitory.

61
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,820
Cheng Yun, washing dishes...

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,250
Cheng Yun comes to help
Ya Yan wash the dishes.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,369
Ya Yan, I'll wash with
detergent, can you rinse?

64
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,370
Hmm, okay.

65
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,690
Ya Yan, aren't you hungry? Only drinking banana milk... Ah, you said
you ate instant noodles? Cheng Yun, I already ate instant noodles.

66
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,820
Soomin also came to the lounge.

67
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,290
Here.

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,620
Junyoung, did you sleep well? Soomin: Mm.

69
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,040
Junyoung, you look pretty good.

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,750
Junyoung, have you had breakfast?
Soomin: I just had some cheese.

71
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,300
Junyoung, you have something on your chin.

72
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,220
What are you doing????!!!?!

73
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,376
This is flirting.
Chuu HOWL HOWL Flirting!

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,160
Chuu HOWL Chuu is
flirting, right? Flirting!

75
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,900
Jun Rong, you got something on your chin.

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
- Got something on it. - That's a scar.
Xiumin, that's a scar.

77
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,540
Ah, really?

78
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,460
Xiumin cares a lot about Dongxu.

79
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,950
Huicheng, what are you doing?

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,750
Liyuan, do you know
Yuzhou Huan? Yuzhou Huan?

81
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,480
Huicheng, how is he? Is
he handsome? Liyuan: Yeah.

82
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,170
Liyuan is my ideal type.

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,530
Liyuan is the epitome of a puppy face.

84
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,930
Liyuan, is she your favorite artist?

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,360
Huicheng (G)I-DLE Wi-Jeon
Liyuan (G)I-DLE Wi-Jeon?

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,900
Liyuan, it would be hard
to surpass her beauty.

87
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,730
Liyuan is indeed very beautiful.

88
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,786
JaeJae is going to perform
"Queencard" immediately.

89
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,140

Yayan: Hm? Notice board?

93
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,930
Yuli: What could it be?

94
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,516

look? Did I leave sideburns?

164
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,359
Dong Xu, oh, it's very
neat and tidy, isn't it?

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,550
- Is that so? It's a bit...
- It's different from usual.

166
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,690
Huicheng, it's different from usual.
- Is that so? It's a bit...
- It's different from usual.

167
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,270
Huicheng, it's different from usual.

168
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,910
Junrong cares a lot about
his hair for no reason.

169
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,190
Today there are unusually
many boys looking in the mirror.

170
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,650
Dongxu, which tie is better?
Junrong, aren't you wearing a vest?

171
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,690
Junrong, this one is better, that
one is a bit short, only that one...

172
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,440
Xiumin, ah~ I don't
care anymore, too nervous.

173
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,180
Yayan, why are you nervous? Xiumin,
is it because of liking someone?

174
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,500
Yayan hahaha you're right.

175
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,740
A very cheerful young boy.

176
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,910
Very cute.

177
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,370
So tired.

178
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,090
Waiting for the little
romance bus for boys and girls.

179
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,580
Yuli, ah, I'm so excited
but also a little scared.

180
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,890
Yayan must be very interesting.
Yuli, what should we do?

181
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,210
Yayan, should we take the bus together?
Or wait for them... No, let's go first?

182
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,976
Xiumin, let's go first. Li
Yuan, I don't know either.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,570
Yayan, shall we sit first? Okay.

184
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,780
Yooli, you guys go ahead.
I'll take a picture of this.

185
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,670
It looks very cute.

186
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,610
-Look at me for a moment.

187
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
So cute!

188
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,110
Su-min, huh? Inside...

189
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,406
Yayan, have they already boarded the
car? Su-min, have they already boarded?

190
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,380
Jun-rong and Dong-xu have already boarded.

191
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,819
Oh my god, oh my god, Jun-rong, Dong-xu!

192
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,590
Sit separately. You sit separately.

193
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,100
Yayan, can I sit wherever?

194
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,360
Yayan, how about sitting here? Xiumin: Yes.

195
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,610
Yooli: Can I sit next to my
sister...? Li Yuan: Yes, go ahead.

196
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,860
Yooli: Ah, I thought you
were waiting for someone.

197
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,720
Yooli: Let me go and see again
(?). Li Yuan: You go ahead and sit.

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,020
Yooli: Because I want to sit here.

199
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,380
Do you want to sit there?

200
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,370
Liyuan sat alone in her seat.

201
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,840
Huicheng and Chengyun also got on the bus.

202
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,130
Hello.

203
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,770
Liyuan, can you sit here?

204
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,196
Yuli, what's going on? Why didn't we
go together... Liyuan, you sit here.

205
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,580
Huicheng didn't hear what Liyuan said.

206
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,390
Yuli, my plan didn't work out.

207
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,950
That's right.

208
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,650
Dongxu has left. Let's go.

209
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,229
Huicheng should be very beautiful.

210
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,316
- Should be able to shoot them all, right?
- Look into the distance.

211
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,420
Yayan, let me try shooting.

212
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,440
Yuli, can we all go in and shoot?

213
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,766
Yayan, can we go in and shoot? In that case, we
should all be able to go in and shoot, right?

220
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,426
The young man is watching videos online.
- Who is it? Hurry up and speak. - It was taken before.

221
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,070

Hmm, what about our sister?

244

Because we still don't know who

- What do you want to eat?
Liyan and Junrong became partners.

322
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,910
- We also cook together every day...
- What do you want to eat?

323
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,040
Seating arrangement for the movie "Eternal Destiny":
Huicheng, Youli, Yayan, Dongxu, Liyan, Junying, Xiumin.

324
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,620
When Yuli sister was in the room, she
kept saying Hope to sit with Huicheng

325
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,180
But Huicheng sat with
me So what should I do...

326
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,400
Yayan Everyone also has
someone they want to sit with

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,600
Yayan Should feel somewhat
happy or disappointed

328
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,990
The wishes of the girls have all clashed

329
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,789
Have the wishes of the boys come true?

330
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,920
Do you want something sweet?

331
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,270
Is it sweet?

332
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,100
Dongxu, Xiumin.

333
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,550
Dongxu, because we've always had a
good feeling for each other as friends.

334
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,180
Dongxu, I wish I could sit next to you.

335
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,510
The wish of a young boy never came true.

336
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,110
Junying, do you want to
drink zero-calorie cola?

Junying, starting from yesterday, I've been
taking the same daily course with Liyuan.

341
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,700
Junying sat together in the cinema.

342
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,890
Junying, and the movie is
about "accidental or inevitable".

343
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,780
Junying, oh, a bit... right...

344
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,440
Liyuan, I still prefer
to only pursue one person.

345
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,780
Huicheng.

346
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,850

- It's always like this.
- Let me sing a song.

373
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,599

374
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600

375
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,940

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,346
- Is it here in the middle?
- Even if there's nothing going on Is it here in Huicheng? In the middle?

Very beautiful

380
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,350

385
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,980
- Calling out like that, wouldn't it be
uncomfortable? Huicheng, wouldn't it be uncomfortable?

386
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,910
- Wouldn't it be uncomfortable? My voice...

Although...

390
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,100
- It's all in the past. Do you know
this song? Liyuan, do you know this song?

- But you are very beautiful. Who is DAY6?

401
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,559
Even that for me

402
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,000
Liyuan, Brother Dongxu?
- Also very beautiful - Dongxu brother

403
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,380
What is being shown to me

404
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,980
Dongxu is losing the game

405
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,730
What is Xiumin doing?

406
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,470
Xiumin, let me take a look

407
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,990
Xiumin did very well!!

408
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,180
Zhenglie, ah, this must be given a warning

409
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,680
JaeJae bumped shoulders, bumped shoulders

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,000
Xiumin, wait a moment.

413
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,240
Dongxu: I will definitely win.

414
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,120
Dongxu's opponent is Junying.

415
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,570
Xiumin is next to Dongxu.

416
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,870
Junying: Why is he so good?

417
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,030
Dongxu vs. Junying.

418
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,090
Junying: Not good.

419
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,940
Dongxu: I won.

420
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,700
Xiumin: Well done. Dongxu:
I only won because of you.

421
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,780
Dongxu: Haha.

422
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,000
Huicheng: Let me sing "A Daily Song"

Is it by Lee Yeon and Huang Zhilie?

426
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,116
Huang Zhilie is pretty good.
Is Yoo Lee good too?

427
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,260
I listen to this song every day.

428
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,316
Yoo Yeon, oh-woo~ I
already think it's good.

429
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,320
Lee Yeon is looking forward to it.
Hui Cheng, are you a little nervous?

430
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:41,660
Don't be nervous.

431
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,679
Can we switch seats?

432
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Hmm.

433
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,086
Lee Yeon said if you sing
well, we should record it.

434
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,420
Help me turn off that sheet music.

435
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,270

- How do I turn off the sheet music, is it this one? - After a tiring day.

438
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,490
Exit the sheet music.

439
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,690
Wandering on the street outside the door.

440
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,599
Like this.

441
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,739
Involuntarily.

442
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,710
Yayan, oh~ why does
the sound sound so good?

443
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:13,460
Softly humming that song

444
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,039
- It sounds a bit like Hwang Chi Yeol - Just
like Yuri, it sounds a bit like Hwang Chi Yeol

445
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,370
Anxiously calling out for you

446
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:26,170
This song I listen to every day,
this song that makes me cry every day

447
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:34,450
Reminds me of you, because
it's like telling our story

448
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,790
The song I listen to every day

449
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,610
Sings so beautifully

450
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:40,890
Yayoung, how does your voice
sound? Liyuan, she's mesmerized.
Sings so beautifully

451
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,080
Yayoung, how does your voice
sound? Liyuan, she's mesmerized.

452
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,870
Yayan is very handsome.

453
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,690
Huicheng feels like he's
come to the wrong place.

454
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,940
- What are you talking about? - Why?

455
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,630
Huicheng is too nervous now.

456
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,050
Let's record it separately.

457
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,810
Xiumin, I went to watch Dongxu play games.
Yayan, really? Are you falling for him?

458
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,630
- No matter what - Let
them be alone together.

459
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,340
Youli, let them be alone together.
- No matter what - Let
them be alone together.

460
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,510
- No matter what - Let
them be alone together.

461
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:04,610
- Covering my ears - Is this the last song?

462
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,290
Xiumin, is this the last song?
- Covering my ears - Is this the last song?

463
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,250
- Covering my ears - Is this the last song?

464
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,560
They are still echoing in my mind.

465
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,755
Yayan, let's go outside.

466
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,370
Even though I struggle,

467
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,839
I don't want to listen anymore.

468
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,560
Xiumin, sister, can you help me get some popcorn?
- But I listen to this song every day. -Hmm.

469
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,720
So cool.

470
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:27,680
Liyuan, I can also sing for you,
but I don't have any quota left.

471
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,330
Liyuan, let's sing together
next time. Huicheng: Okay.

472
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,070
Huicheng: I felt a bit
too excited at that time.

473
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,150
Huicheng: I ran to where the girls were.

474
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,610
Huicheng: I sang a song.

475
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,810
Huicheng: But after it was over, I was
so nervous that my voice was trembling.

476
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,880
Huicheng: It seems like
I was a bit too excited.

477
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,370
Let's go.
Hmm.

478
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,950
Huicheng: I'm really looking
forward to it. Yuli: Me too.

479
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,430
I think it will be very good.

480
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,400
Yayan feels that the movie
will be very good. Xiumin, hmm

481
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,570
Dongxu wishes you a pleasant
viewing. Xiumin, you too.

482
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,400
What is it?

483
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,199
What is it?

484
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,600
Zheng Lie, what are you thinking?

485
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,540
The meaning of Dong Xu
whispering to Xiu Min just now is

486
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,670
Even though I'm going to the
movies with Ya Yan now, but you...

487
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,680
Although I'm currently
Even though I'm going to the
movies with Ya Yan now, but you...

488
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:23,700
Even though I'm going to the
movies with Ya Yan now, but you...

489
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,700
- Going to the movies with Yayan, but you...
- Yeah,
Even though I'm going to the
movies with Ya Yan now, but you...

490
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:26,790
Even though I'm going to the
movies with Ya Yan now, but you...

491
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,016
Have feelings, it feels like I'm telling
her that I'll be back after a trip, so...

492
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,820
Have feelings, ah, I really like it.

493
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,479
Huicheng, is it G8? Yuli, hmm.

494
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Are you 7?
Hmm.

495
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,560
Yayan, what's your date, is it the 13th?
- What's your date, is it the 13th? - 13th.

496
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
Yayan: Oh, this chair is so comfortable.

497
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Hold on a moment.

498
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
Chengyun: Are you 12 or 13? Xiumin: Um, 13.

499
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
Hold on a moment.
I haven't seen this before.

500
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,160
Huicheng: I have a strange feeling like we will watch a
movie together. Yuli: Really? Is there a certain atmosphere?

501
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,640
Huicheng: Could it be déjà vu?
Feels like I've seen it somewhere.

502
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,050
Yuli: A sense of familiarity.

503
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,060
Huicheng, do you want me to roughly
tell you (the plot of the movie)?

504
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,650
Okay.
Huicheng, do you want me to roughly
tell you (the plot of the movie)?

505
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,060
Okay.

506
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,100
Huicheng, I remember it
has a rural background.

507
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,626
Yayan, have you seen "P.S. I Love
You"? Dongxu: Yeah, I've seen it.

508
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,490
Yayan, I cried my eyes
out while watching it.

509
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,650
Dongxu, have you seen "Forrest Gump"?

510
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:49,960
No.
Dongxu, have you seen "Forrest Gump"?

511
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,700
No.

512
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,186
Dongxu, you haven't seen that
one either? Yayan: No, I haven't.

513
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,160
Yayan, I cried when I rewatched "Frozen".

514
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,660
Liyuan: Oh? Is that how it starts?

515
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,830
Liyuan: What's going on?

516
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,830
Junrong: At first, I thought
he entered the wrong theater.

517
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:15,750
Yayan: I thought there were only eight
people, thinking it was just the right number.

518
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,090
NEW... Newcomer?!!?!

519
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,240
Are you serious?!!!!

520
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,870
Zhenglie: Transfer student?

521
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,610
Liyuan scared me.

522
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,350
Yuli really scared me.

523
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,646
Yuli Everyone is like, "What's
going on? This expression..."

524
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,100
Liyuan looks very masculine.

525
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,460
Liyuan Oh! Looks quite handsome?

526
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,820
Yayan has delicate facial features.

527
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,170
Yayan gives off a confident
and self-assured vibe.

528
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,690
Yayan, hello.

529
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,690
Boy: Excuse me, is this
column H? 秀敏: Oh? Yes, it is.

530
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,610
秀敏: Hello.

531
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,340
坐秀敏旁边？？？？？

532
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,050
Chuu: Dongxu, are you nervous?

533
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,390
I'm sorry.

534
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,060
Chengyun: Oh... I got startled.

535
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,340
Chengyun: I happened to
be sitting next to Xiumin.

536
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,880
Chengyun: Oh? What should I do now?

537
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,110
Chengyun: What should I do now?

538
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,060
Minjian, my name is Park
Minjian, I am a music producer.

539
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,750
Producer, Park Minjian.

540
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,860
Park Minjian, 18 years old.

541
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,910
Currently active as a music producer.

542
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,300
The songs I participated in producing
have made it to the Billboard charts.

543
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,370
Howl, Oh my god? The Billboard charts??
Yes, they made it to the charts.

544
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:08,840
Really?
Howl, Oh my god? The Billboard charts??
Yes, they made it to the charts.

545
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:08,960
Really?

546
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:10,550
Chuu, who is this person?

547
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,306
Jung Lie, but he has the charm of a producer.
- But he still has the charm of being a producer - of course

548
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,630
JaeJae needs to catch him, right?

549
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,780
JaeJae must have a lot of royalties

550
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,696
Why do you always tarnish
people here, Zheng Lie?

551
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,560
JaeJae isn't...

552
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,986
Are you new here, Su Min?
- Are you new here? - Yes

553
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,690
Min Jian, let's have dinner together later

Me? Su Min?
Me - Yes.

Xiumin - Ah, are you new here?

Xiumin - But why did you give it to me?

561
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,986
Minjian - Wait, I'll tell you.

Minjian, I chose Xiumin.

564
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,420
This morning, at a café,

565
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,990
The transfer student sat next to the classmate they chose for
themselves. After watching the movie, They could have dinner together.

566
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,210
Minjian, Xiumin looked very cool
playing the piano, so I chose her.

567
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
What... what's going on?

568
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,220
Xiumin, how old are you?
Minjian, I'm in 11th grade.

569
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,389
Minjian, how old are you?
Xiumin, I'm in 10th grade.

570
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,390
Understood.

571
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,609
Xiumin, would you like to shake
hands? It's nice to meet you.

572
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,610
Nice to meet you.

573
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,860
Minjian, we should speak straightforwardly,
but it suddenly became awkward.

574
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,020
Xiumin, I am also
feeling awkward right now.

575
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,570
Dongxu, very flustered... flustered.

576
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,040
Dongxu, not only is he in good shape, but
also has a masculine and handsome demeanor.

577
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,470
Dongxu, I unconsciously started
feeling jealous of him too.

578
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,220
Yayan is so flustered. Dongxu: Yeah...

579
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,380
Yayan: Ah, suddenly can't catch my breath.

coming? I like newcomers.

Xiumin: Is she a newcomer? Chengyun: Yeah.

584
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,780
Zhenglie: Where will she sit?

585
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,350
Sigh...

586
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,840
Youqing: It will be exciting if
she sits next to Dongxu for sure.

587
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,700
At this moment, sitting next to Dongxu - please,
please, please. Please, please, please, Dongxu!
Youqing: It will be exciting if
she sits next to Dongxu for sure.

Yayan, when I glanced at her, she looked so
beautiful with narrowed eyes and a smile.

601
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,309
Liyuan: Should we clap for them?
Junrong: Let's just sit quietly.

602

Liyuan: She is so beautiful.

Liyuan: When she said hello to me, I looked at
her and thought, "Wow, she is so beautiful."

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,170
Not thirsty at the moment.

637
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,470
Dongxu: I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. Unconsciously, very anxious.

638
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,710
I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. It's just in my mind.
Dongxu: I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. Unconsciously, very anxious.

639
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:27,740
Dongxu: I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. Unconsciously, very anxious.

640
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
Unconsciously.

641
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,670
Dongxu: I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. Unconsciously, very anxious.

642
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,020
Very anxious.
Dongxu: I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. Unconsciously, very anxious.

643
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,070
Dongxu: I'm feeling a bit anxious
too. Unconsciously, very anxious.

644
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,690
Dongxu: Is your mind blank?

645
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,590
Xuan Yayan

646
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,450
Liu Dongxu

647
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,410
Cui Huiren

Park Min-jeon

652
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Kim Sung-yun

653
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,110
Kim Li-yuan

654
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,240
Kim Jun-rong

655
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,380
Children's rest area, practice room, dormitory,
attic, consultation room, personal practice room

656
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,980
Adolescent romance

657
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,770
Episode 3: Not by chance but by necessity

658
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,510
The origin is not extinguished.

659
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,100
Liyuan's classic scene
is about to come out.

660
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,190
Huicheng, this scene is coming out.
- This scene is coming out. - It's raining. Let me take you back.

661
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
It's over.

662
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,940
Honestly speaking,

663
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,900
- I probably held back tears ten times.
- What?

664
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:18,110
Huicheng, I probably
held back tears ten times.

665
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,210
Junrong, in some sense...
Isn't this her father's affair?

666
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,210
To some extent
Junrong, in some sense...
Isn't this her father's affair?

667
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,560
Junrong, in some sense...
Isn't this her father's affair?

668
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,770
- Isn't this her father's affair? - Hmm
Junrong, in some sense...
Isn't this her father's affair?

669
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,300
Junrong, in some sense...
Isn't this her father's affair?

670
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:31,530
Junrong, despite witnessing all that, she is still
able to view it romantically. It's quite incredible...

671
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,960
Junrong is a capital T person (Note:
referring to a rational personality)

672
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,130
She also... Zixi also...

referring to a sentimental personality)

675
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,210
Yayan, you started crying from
the restaurant scene, right?

676
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,310
Yayan, I desperately stare at the
ceiling, holding back my tears...

677
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,830
Yayan, is the movie good?

678
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,980
Even after the movie
ends, I can't stop crying.

679
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,846
What should I do? Dongxu is so cute.
- What should I do? Dongxu is so cute. - Dongxu is so cute.

680
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,129
Zhenglie, so adorable!

681
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,980
Really, what should I do?

682
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:10,630
But if someone cries at this point...

683
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,420
If I see someone crying, my
liking for him should increase.
But if someone cries at this point...

684
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,450

687
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:13,880
It should increase.
If I see someone crying, my
liking for him should increase.

688
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:13,950
It should increase.

689
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,010
Feelings may be right, may be right.
- I will too. -That's right.
It should increase.

690
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,146
Feelings may be right, may be right.
- I will too. -That's right.

691
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,786
Passionate, because it's unexpected.
- That's right. -That's right.

692
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,010
Chuu, being sincere is a good thing. He
is very sincere, and that's a good thing.

693
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,420
Minjian, it seems like we have to leave first.
Xiumin, oh, me? It seems like we have to go first.

694
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,340
- Me? - Yeah.
Minjian, it seems like we have to leave first.
Xiumin, oh, me? It seems like we have to go first.

695
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,420
- Me? - Yeah.

696
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,640
Minjian and Xiumin are going
to have dinner together today.

697
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,830
Liyuan, I envy them.

698
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,260
Liyuan, I also want to go
out for a meal with someone.

699
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,970
Let's go.

700
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,420
Dongxu and Huiren are
heading to the dinner location.

701
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,389
Liyuan, it feels so
empty with two people gone.

702
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,390
It really feels lonely.

703
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,780
Yayan, do we need to re-decide
on the dining duty students?

704
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,540
Yes.
Yayan, do we need to re-decide
on the dining duty students?

705
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:11,780
Yes.

706
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,230
Yayan, they should have a
good meal, right? Barbecue?

707
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,920
They should have a good meal.
Yayan, they should have a
good meal, right? Barbecue?

708
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:12,930
Yayan, they should have a
good meal, right? Barbecue?

709
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,560
- Barbecue?
- They just went out together like that.
Yayan, they should have a
good meal, right? Barbecue?

710
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:14,680
- Barbecue?
- They just went out together like that.

711
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,040
Liyuan, hey, let's also go eat barbecue.

712
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,860
Okay.
Liyuan, hey, let's also go eat barbecue.

713
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,040
Okay.

714
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,946
Xiumin, you cried too hard. Minjian, I originally
wanted to act natural, but it just fell off by itself.

715
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,050
Xiumin did a great job. Minjian: Thank you.

716
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:43,050
Junrong was a little scared. I didn't expect
two people to suddenly come into the cinema.

717
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,410
Yayan was a bit nervous when
the transfer student arrived.

718
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,960
Yayan's thoughts seem to have multiplied.

719
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,870
Yayan has ideas about how
the atmosphere will change.

720
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,670
Nervousness and curiosity
towards the new friend.

721
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,029
Hui Ren & Dong Xu

722
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,030
What do you like to eat?

723
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,130
Hui Ren: Plain rice and grilled meat salad?

724
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,816
Dong Xu: We need to order.
- We need to order. -We need to order.

725
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,040
Dong Xu: Couple set meal...
- Couple set meal. -Alright.

726
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,450
Dong Xu: Don't you know the
friend (Min Jian) who came with you?

727
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,366
Hui Ren: Hmm, first time meeting.
Dong Xu: First time meeting, huh?

728
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,190
Huiren, because he stood behind
me, to be honest, I didn't see at all.

729
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:26,780
Huiren, didn't you expect it at all? Did
you never think that someone would join?

730
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,260
- Didn't you expect it at all? - Hmm.
Huiren, didn't you expect it at all? Did
you never think that someone would join?

731
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,310
Huiren, didn't you expect it at all? Did
you never think that someone would join?

732
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,430
- Did you never think that someone would join?
- Hmm.
Huiren, didn't you expect it at all? Did
you never think that someone would join?

733
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,550
Huiren, didn't you expect it at all? Did
you never think that someone would join?

734
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,010
Dongxu, of course, thought that it would
just be a few of us going to watch a movie.

735
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,200
Dongxu, what is your
ideal type? Huiren, me?

736
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,709
JaeJae, wow, asking about
the ideal type right away.

737
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,820
Instead, because she is very simple - yes.

738
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,320
JaeJae, instead, because she is very
simple, she doesn't beat around the bush.
Instead, because she is very simple - yes.

739
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,330
JaeJae, instead, because she is very
simple, she doesn't beat around the bush.

740
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,600
- So she doesn't beat around
the bush - that's right.
JaeJae, instead, because she is very
simple, she doesn't beat around the bush.

741
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:43,706
- So she doesn't beat around
the bush - that's right.

742
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,216
JaeJae directly asks you
what your ideal type is?

743
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,000
That's right.

744
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,170
HOWL because I'm really curious.
That's right.

745
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,370
HOWL because I'm really curious.

746
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,410
Hui Ren, mmm...

747
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,640
Hui Ren, Kim Woo Bin...

748
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,810
Dong XU, Kim Woo Bin?
What do you like about him?

749
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,890
Huirun is very handsome.

750
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,230
Huirun's acting skills
are also very good...!

751
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,970
Dongxu, so let's talk
about your first love.

752
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,120
Huirun, me? Dongxu, yes.
Tell me about your first love.

753
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,860
Huirun, it was when I was in kindergarten.

754
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,726
Huirun, when I started kindergarten.

755
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,290
Huirun, there was a boy who everyone said
was tall and handsome when they saw him.

756
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,060
More than half of the girls
in Huiran's class like him.

757
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,340
Huiran, so I started liking him
too... but he transferred schools.

758
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,741
Huiran, when he was in
kindergarten, at the age of seven.

759
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,640
When he was in kindergarten.

760
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:28,990
JaeJae, she said her first
love was at the age of seven.
When he was in kindergarten.

761
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,880
JaeJae, she said her first
love was at the age of seven.

762
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,600
JaeJae, she can still remember
things from kindergarten...

763
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,550
Huiran, what about your first love? You're
not going to say you don't have one, right?

764
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,220
Dongxu, I think...

765
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,540
Dongxu, the person who truly makes me understand
what love is would be my true first love.

766
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,440
Currently, it seems like I haven't had my first love
yet. Currently, I can't think of anyone like that.

767
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,370
Dongxu, because I haven't
been in a relationship before.

768
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,040
Dongxu, because of this
reason, I am very inexperienced.

769
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:07,080
Dongxu, I haven't had my first love yet.

770
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,000
Minjian, I plan to go there together.

771
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,926
It's so beautiful.
Xiumin, so beautiful. 民建: Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful, right? - Hm.

772
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,520
Xiumin, wow, it must be very delicious.

773
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,630
Xiumin: Ah, not delicious, but beautiful.

774
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,700
Xiumin: Hello.

775
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,636
Minjian: My song is now on the music charts
in the US. My song is now on the Apple charts.

776
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,140
Xiumin: Can you see it on
there? Minjian: Hm, the US charts.

777
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,535
Minjian: This is my song. Xiumin: Hmm?

778
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:35,390
"Sadness": A song I produced.

779
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,380
Minjian: A song I produced. Xiumin: Ah, really?
- Ah, really? - Hmm.
"Sadness": A song I produced.

780
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,576
Minjian: A song I produced. Xiumin: Ah, really?
- Ah, really? - Hmm.

781
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,530
Xiumin: Ah, that's amazing.

782
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,450
Xiumin: Wow...

783
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,616
Xiumin: What is it? You're so talented. Minjian:
No, no. But it didn't make it into the Hot 100.

784
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,540
Minjian: I thought it could make it in.

785
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,730
Minjian, it's such a pity...

786
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,446
Minjian, it must be played
frequently on the radio...

787
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,460
Xiumin, you're too modest,
right? Minjian, not really.

788
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,590
JaeJae wants to say he's modest, but as soon as
he gets on the bus, he shows off his achievements.

789
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,970
- That's right.
- He's showing off a bit too much.

790
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,070
- That's right.
- He's showing off a bit too much.

791
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,230
Zhenglie, there's still a long
way to go for modesty, right?
- That's right.
- He's showing off a bit too much.

792
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,110
Zhenglie, there's still a long
way to go for modesty, right?

793
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,350
That's right.
Zhenglie, there's still a long
way to go for modesty, right?

794
00:39:59,350 --> 00:39:59,690
That's right.

795
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,346
JaeJae is saying that, just like
HOWL, when he sees someone, he...

796
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,836
JaeJae said, "This is a video of me
dancing," and then showed it to others.

797
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,190
JaeJae had hoped that this could become
the number one popular movie. What a pity.

798
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,390
HOWL also thought it could become the
number one popular movie. What a shame.

799
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,576
JaeJae's comments also reflect
the construction of the community.

800
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,480
It is because of joining late that JaeJae
wants to clearly recommend themselves.

801
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,060
That's right, that's right.
It is because of joining late that JaeJae
wants to clearly recommend themselves.

802
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,100
That's right, that's right.

803
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,316
Zhenglie, you did a great
job, you did a great job.

804
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,300
Chuu If it were me, I
would probably do the same.

805
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
Su-min You know my name,
right? Min-jeon Kim Su-min

806
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,010
Su-min Yeah. Min-jeon Right?

807
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,980
Su-min Your memory is good.

808
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,490
Min-jeon So pretty.

809
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,790
Min-jeon & Su-min

810
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,360
Min-jeon carefully selected
a small and cute restaurant

811
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,530
Su-min Did you watch
the ballet performance?

812
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,126
Xiumin also watched the
video of me playing the piano.

813
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,870
Minjian, I watched them all. Xiumin, right?

814
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,246
Minjian, when watching the videos,
because you're the most beautiful.

815
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,250
That's why I chose you.

816
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,226
Xiumin, do you prefer someone
older or someone the same age as you?

817
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,930
I like both.

818
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,630
As long as we get along well,
I like them all. How about you?

819
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,840
I should probably prefer
someone older than me.

820
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,680
Minjian Gege is in a good mood.

821
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,300
Minjian, was your original
career direction music? Xiumin: Yes!

822
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,940
Xiumin, besides music, have
you not considered anything else?

823
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,700
Minjian: Wow, that's cool.

824
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,486
Minjian: Isn't it tiring? Playing the piano, isn't it
tiring? Xiumin: Are you referring to practicing the piano?

825
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,110
Xiumin: Because you have to sit alone
for a long time, it's very difficult.

826
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,556
Minjian, is the university also
considering choosing the piano direction?

827
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,620
Xiumin, I have already
been admitted to university.

828
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,940
Minjian, really? Xiumin, two months ago I took the
entrance exam for a music university in Germany.

829
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,120
Minjian, wow, that's crazy.

830
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,680
Minjian, you are a
genius. Xiumin, no, I'm not.

831
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,570
Minjian, I'm so envious.

832
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,450
Minjian, I need to get along well with you.

833
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,706
Minjian, it feels like I'm standing at the
crossroads of choices now, university...

834
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,550
Xiumin, which one do you
prefer and enjoy doing?

835
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,470
Minjian, I want to do both!
I enjoy and excel at both.

836
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,990
Xiumin, is it Hip hop? Minjian, it's
more about Beat making than Hip hop.

837
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,030
Xiumin, then we should continue
doing it. Minjian, we definitely should.

838
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,530
Minjian, although it's a bit hard.
Xiumin, I feel like it will be challenging.

839
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,740
Are the movies interesting?

840
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,200
Xiumin, they are quite interesting.

841
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:19,576
Xiumin, but it's a bit hard to concentrate in
the beginning. Mingjian: I feel the same way.

842
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,350
Xiumin: It suddenly gets
more focused towards the end.

843
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,570
Mingjian: I noticed you keep
touching the (gifted) doll next to you.

844
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,590
Mingjian: It seems like you
really like it. So I feel fortunate.

845
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,490
Xiumin: Yes, I like dolls.

846
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,800
The girl likes the boy's doll.

847
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,410
Xiumin, thank you.

848
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,090
Xiumin, the arrangement looks
very beautiful. Minjian: Yes.

849
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,960
Xiumin, come and eat something delicious.

850
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,550
Minjian: But I feel like it
will collapse when it's cut.

851
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,640
Minjian: Is this how
it's supposed to be cut?

852
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,740
Today's knife is especially
difficult to cut with.

853
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,115
Xiumin, you seem a little
nervous. Minjian: Yes.

854
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:31,450
- Right? - Hmm, very nervous.
Minjian is very nervous.

855
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,576
Xiumin, you can eat it like this,
right? Minjian, this should be better.

856
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,660
Minjian, sorry. Xiumin,
it's okay, no problem.

857
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,310
Xiumin, how is it? Is it
delicious? Minjian, it's delicious.

858
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,380
Minjian, so happy.

859
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,330
Xiumin, take a photo, okay?

860
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,940
Xiumin, I really don't
know how to take pictures.

861
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,380
Xiumin, really... why
is that? Minjian, What?

862
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,490
Xiumin, why are you so funny?

863
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,206
Minjian, you made the right choice in
selecting you. Xiumin, really? Thank you.

864
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,230
Fortunately.

865
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Do you have the confidence to love?

866
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,970
Oh, asking directly?

867
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:20,150
Do you have the confidence to love?

868
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,150
- Xin Ai - Oh my God.
Do you have the confidence to love?

869
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:21,180
Do you have the confidence to love?

870
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,206
- Xin Ai - How old are you?
Do you have the confidence to love?

871
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:22,230
Do you have the confidence to love?

872
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,650
Xin Ai.
Do you have the confidence to love?

873
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,130
Do you have the confidence to love?

874
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,880
JaeJae, it's the first time I've
seen Xiumin take the initiative to talk.

875
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,910
How long have we only met now?
JaeJae, it's the first time I've
seen Xiumin take the initiative to talk.

876
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:26,990
How long have we only met now?

877
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,250
What does "Zheng Lie" mean?
- What does this mean? - Yeah, that's right.
How long have we only met now?

878
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,376
What does "Zheng Lie" mean?
- What does this mean? - Yeah, that's right.

879
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,896
JaeJae, do you have the confidence to love?
What does "have the confidence to love" mean?

880
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,070
Chuu, asking myself? Or... Asking myself if
I have confidence to love someone else...?

881
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,430
- Asking myself or - Asking myself
Chuu, asking myself? Or... Asking myself if
I have confidence to love someone else...?

882
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,460
Chuu, asking myself? Or... Asking myself if
I have confidence to love someone else...?

883
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,826
Asking myself if I have the
confidence to love someone else
Chuu, asking myself? Or... Asking myself if
I have confidence to love someone else...?

884
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:32,830
Chuu, asking myself? Or... Asking myself if
I have confidence to love someone else...?

885
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,006
- Asking myself or what?
- What exactly are you asking about love? JaeJae asks herself? Or what...

886
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,670
Asking oneself
HOWL asks himself... Hahaha

887
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,500
Can I have a bottle of
non-alcoholic beer, please? (?)

888
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,719
Do you have the confidence to love, Xiumin?

889
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,670
Do you have the confidence to love?

890
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,090
Minjian, well... if that person is good?

891
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,260
Minjian, what about you? Xiumin: I arrived three
days earlier than you, so I have confidence.

892
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,310
Minjian, do you have someone
specific in mind who likes you?

893
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,630
Minjian, don't you
know now? Xiumin: Well...

894
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,600
Teenagers dreaming of love

895
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,610
Junrong: Did you add another bed?

896
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,730
Huicheng: Has the food also
increased?? Chengyun: Ah, is that so?

897
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,220
Huicheng: That's great.

898
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,790
Chengyun: The luggage is here.

899
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,200
Chengyun: So there are
five closets... five.

900
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,600
Chengyun: Were there
originally five closets?

901
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,930
Chengyun, ah...!

902
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,430
Chengyun, wasn't that (wardrobe)
covered up in the beginning, right?

903
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,420
Chengyun, it was covered up
with something bigger than this.

904
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:51,060
Hidden wardrobe of the
Minjian [name of the place]

905
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,910
Another bed was added as well.

906
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,650
Junrong, the preparation is great.

907
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,899
Girls' dormitory.

908
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,270
It's so cool.

909
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,729
Yuli, we need to clean up, Huiren
is coming. Yayan, you're right.

910
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,866
- I'm so nervous (when the new transfer student comes) - Really?
Yayan, I'm so nervous (when the new transfer student comes)

911
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,310
Yayan, extremely nervous

912
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,080
- I'm very curious - Yeah Yuli, I'm very
curious (about the transfer student) Yayan, Yeah

913
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,676
Yuli, what is it like... the musical theater department?
Yayan, I really thought Huirun was in the dance department

914
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,740
Yayan, do you feel that the male transfer student
is very confident? Yuli: Yes, you're right.

915
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,950
Yuli: He gives off a
very manly vibe, right?

916
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,560
Yayan: He feels a bit like a
manly man. Yuli: Exactly, exactly.

917
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,740
Yuli: If there is a newcomer...

918
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,170
Yuli: Things will be a bit
different for everyone...

919
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,290
Yayan: The atmosphere will
change. Yuli: A new atmosphere.

920
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,550
It's a bit like a reset.

921
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,090
Yayan, let's go?

922
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,870
Yooli, ah... I have so many thoughts today.

923
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,786
Yayan, I have more thoughts
today than yesterday.

924
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,690
Yayan, it's even more complicated today.

925
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,840
Yayan, is it because of the new person?

926
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,000
But that...

927
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,790
Yayan, that's also one of
the reasons. Yooli, right?

928
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,130
Liyuan, oh what? Why is there a watermelon?

929
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,936
-I was just thinking of having
watermelon-What's going on?

930
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,450
What's up, Liyuan?! I
suddenly feel really good.

931
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,140
I suddenly feel really good.
What's up, Liyuan?! I
suddenly feel really good.

932
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,650
What's up, Liyuan?! I
suddenly feel really good.

933
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,380
- So lovely. - So lovely.

934
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,390
- So lovely. - So lovely.
Zhenglie is so cute.

935
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,436
JaeJae was a little restless
because Huirun was coming.

936
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,636
JaeJae's mood improved
after seeing watermelon.

937
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,220
What should I do, Youqing?

938
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,920
Youqing, I thought about
giving them something just now.

939
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,790
Yayan Oh! Oh, naengmyeon!

940
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,149
Yuli It must be delicious. I'm hungry.

941
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,496
- Naengmyeon with seasoned grilled meat, you know?
- I'm so hungry. Yayan Do you understand naengmyeon with seasoned grilled meat?

942
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:27,790
I'm so hungry.

943
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,070
Just thinking about eating makes me happy.
I'm so hungry.

944
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,985
Just thinking about eating makes me happy.

945
00:47:29,986 --> 00:47:31,570
- That's great. - Yeah!

946
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,290
Yayan The dessert is watermelon.
Liyuan Isn't that great?

947
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,210
Liyuan: I envy them so much.

948
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,640
Yayan: Are you going
on a date? Liyuan: Yes.

949
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,710
Yayan: Will we go on a date soon, maybe?

950
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,216
Yayan: Or maybe we
will never have a date...

951
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,380
Liyuan: Will that happen?
Youli: No, I feel so sad...

952
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,620
Huicheng: Is it starting so soon?

953
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,220
Chengyun: What can I do?
Junrong: What's on the menu today?

954
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,900
Huicheng: Oh! It's meat.
It's meat.

955
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,630
Junrong: Oh, it looks so
delicious. Youli: Okay, okay.

956
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,800
Liyuan: Put some pepper
here, pepper, pepper.

957
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,200
Huicheng: Pepper, pepper, pepper?

958
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,460
Liyuan: Alright, thank you.

959
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,480
Yayan: Phew! That was close.

960
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,070
Jung Rong, move aside.

961
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,120
Jung Rong, I have washed
my hands. Ya Yan: Hmm.

962
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,000
It must be delicious.

963
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,110
JaeJae: Ah, Jung Rong is over there now...

964
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,990
Embracing from behind (?) is not enough.

965
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,290
Saying "move aside" while
embracing from behind.

966
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,950
Chuu: Embrace from behind?

967
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,160
Don't tarnish their reputation, really!!

968
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,600
Don't bring up the age group.

969
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,790
JaeJae: Because Jung
Rong is so indecisive now.

970
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,840
Zhenglie, that's right.
What should we do now?

971
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,640
Chuu, we should have more conversations.

972
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,550
Chengyun, where is the place to
throw cans? Huicheng, thank you.

973
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:01,680
Chengyun quickly tidied up the garbage.

974
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,680
Chengyun, plastic bags
are the fourth category.

975
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,916
Chengyun, paper is the first category.

976
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,230
Chengyun, paper, plastic
bottles and cans, cans.

977
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,950
Chengyun, plastic bottles
and cans, cans, plastic bags.

978
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,479
Junrong is so cute, right?

979
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,545
- What? - So cute.

980
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:18,860
Chengyun, not...

981
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,210
Chengyun, what? What did I do? Li Yuan,
the more you look, the cuter it gets.

982
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,560
Li Yuan, I'm really curious about the new
person. I hope they come soon. Yayan, me too.

983
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,580
Youli, I'm just curious
about what they all did.

984
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,950
Yayan, are they coming back after dinner?

985
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,296
Yayan, probably not, right...? Yuri, I feel
like we should chat about it, don't you think?

986
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,250
Yayan, it's so funny, my
whole attention is on that.

987
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,880
I'm going to start now.

988
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,330
This should fit.

989
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,510
Follow the recipe to make it.

990
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,890
- Yeah, yeah - Cheesy corn is so delicious.

991
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,370
Liyuan, cheesy corn is so delicious.
- Yeah, yeah - Cheesy corn is so delicious.

992
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:00,569
Liyuan, cheesy corn is so delicious.

993
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,180
- Is that so? - Is that so?

994
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,900
Is Huicheng delicious? Is it delicious? Is it delicious?
- Is it delicious? Is it delicious? Is it delicious? - Really, try it.
- Is that so? - Is that so?

995
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,220
Is Huicheng delicious? Is it delicious? Is it delicious?
- Is it delicious? Is it delicious? Is it delicious? - Really, try it.

996
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,539
Youli is really delicious.

997
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,290
- Really? - Mmm.

998
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,450
That's great.

999
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:13,300
Liyuan, it would be great if they
could come while we are having a meal.

1000
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,720
Yayan, no... I feel like
it would cause indigestion.

1001
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,270
Junrong, ah... hello
everyone. Yayan, hello.

1002
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,900
Huicheng Embarrassing, embarrassing?

1003
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,300
Youli Very curious.

1004
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,930
It feels like crashing a family gathering.

1005
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,030
Huicheng The table has more (?) chairs too?

1006
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,390
The little rest area has changed as well.

1007
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,860
Dongxu and Huiren are back.

1008
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,350
Huiren What is this? It's so beautiful.

1009
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,946
- Wow, it's really heavy.
- Should we prepare? Should we prepare? Liyuan Wow, it's really heavy.

1010
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,490
Definitely very delicious.

1011
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,410
Jun Rong, let me try to break it.

1012
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,250
Ya Yan, brother, your bones might break.

1013
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,940
It will bounce back.

1014
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,866
Ya Yan, if you keep
hitting it, it should work.

1015
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,459
Li Yuan, can we try using fists?

1016
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
- Use fists? - Yes, yes.

1017
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,030
Jun Rong, then it might really shatter.

1018
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,400
Let's put it on the ground and try.
Jun Rong, then it might really shatter.

1019
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,790
Let's put it on the ground and try.

1020
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,006
Yu Li, it won't shatter. If brother makes it, it won't shatter.
- Try it here - It won't break if my older brother does it

1021
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,750
Junrong won't break the dining table

1022
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,750
Junrong, ah, the dining table
might break Yuli, it won't break

1023
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,210
What's the situation? What's the situation?

1024
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,330
Huicheng succeeded in one try. Wow~ So cool

1025
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,990
Yuli, what's the situation...?
The watermelon is too ripe

1026
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:29,570
How are you so strong?
The heavy reversal of slender arms

1027
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,520
Liyuan takes a bite

1028
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,370
Liyuan, is it delicious? Yayan: Mmm

1029
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,250
Still haven't seen Huiren and Dongxu

1030
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,270
Youli, hello~

1031
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,820
Yayan: Hm? They're here

1032
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,860
Chengyun: I'm too shy to say hello
because I'm afraid Yayan: Me too, haha

1033
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,360
Dongxu: Friends, say hello
to her. She is a new friend

1034
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,260
Huicheng, hello

1035
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,630
Yayan, hello Chengyun, hello

1036
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,850
Junrong, I think I've
seen you at school before

1037
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,770
Huiren, me too... I've seen you too

1038
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Both attend the same school

1039
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,180
Liyuan, is everything going smoothly
today, Dongxu? Junrong, what did you eat?

1040
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,090
Dongxu, we... had salad

1041
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:34,339
Nice

1042
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,939
Youli, salad? Is that all?
Liyuan, we had cold noodles with meat

1043
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,740
Ate my favorite salad - Did you eat salad?
Dongxu ate my favorite salad

1044
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,060
Dongxu also ate meat

1045
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,600
Yuli, meat? Dongxu, went
to a good restaurant to eat

1046
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,210
Yuli, are you flaunting now?

1047
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:48,290
Is that so?

1048
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,830
Dongxu, here are spoons and chopsticks

1049
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,400
Dongxu, this is an oven, here
is a rice cooker, water dispenser

1050
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,830
If you're thirsty, you can come here to get
something to drink. A tour of Dongxu's lounge.

1051
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,290
Dongxu, there's also a
lot of delicious food here.

1052
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,560
JaeJae, no, why are you
introducing storage cabinets?

1053
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,820
JaeJae, I think she should
be able to find it herself.

1054
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,000
JaeJae, it's not a showroom.

1055
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,040
Chuu, let me help you wallpaper again.

1056
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,240
Junrong, isn't she coming? That...

1057
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,620
- Princess, that - Xiumin
Junrong Princess Yayan Xiumin

1058
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,460
Junrong Doesn't she look
a bit like a princess?

1059
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,190
She's very beautiful, like a doll

1060
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,930
Xiumin hasn't come back yet

1061
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,560
Minjian & Xiumin

1062
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,170
Minjian It's very suitable
for a walk. Xiumin Yes.

1063
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,386
Xiumin Because it's just the two of us,
it's very good. Minjian Yes, that's right.

1064
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,710
Minjian is very peaceful. Xiumin: Hmm.

1065
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,970
Minjian: Because it is classical
music (Xiumin) and composition (Minjian).

1066
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,020
Minjian: So I thought it might not go well.

1067
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,520
Minjian: But surprisingly,
it goes well. That's great.

1068
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,860
Xiumin: You are my first date.
Minjian: Me too, same here.

1069
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,680
Xiumin: Where do you want to go for our
future dates? Minjian: Here, is it okay?

1070
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,110
Xiumin: This place is really nice,
right? Minjian: Yes, I want to take a walk.

1071
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,950
Xiumin: You made a good choice.
Minjian: Yes, I also want to have a chat.

1072
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,440
Minjian: I seem to
prefer this kind of place.

1073
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,580
Minjian: Compared to crowded places.

1074
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,390
Xiumin: It's very peaceful. Minjian: Yes.

1075
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,660
Xiumin: Shall we go?
Minjian: Shall we? Let's go.

1076
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,760
Xiumin: Minjian is very steady.

1077
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,650
Xiumin is very kind and has a
clear understanding of her dreams.

1078
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:01,100
Minjian turned on the flashlight.

1079
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:07,070
Minjian tightened his nerves in order
to behave as gentlemanly as possible.

1080
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,920
The gentlemanly behavior of tight nerves.

1081
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,620
Thank you, Xiumin.

1082
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,600
Xiumin, is he a gentleman?

1083
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,640
Minjian didn't lose his manners.

1084
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,170
Oh, Minjian~!

1085
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,109
JaeJae is almost watching "Golden Spy" now.

1086
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,000
"Golden Spy"

1087
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,575
Politeness shapes the Minjian.

1088
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:31,620
- It's "Golden Spy".
- She said it's "Golden Spy".

1089
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,540
Affectionate. She said it's "Golden Spy".
- It's "Golden Spy".
- She said it's "Golden Spy".

1090
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,136
Affectionate. She said it's "Golden Spy".

1091
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,660
JaeJae is very polite, very polite.

1092
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,860
Chuu is so funny.

1093
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,076
Zhenglie, ah, I want to quickly see that little
recording. Ah, I want to see that diary quickly.

1094
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,716
JaeJae, why did you write Shao Shao's diary so
late? It seems like it's already late at night.

1095
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,940
Zheng Lie, can't you write it now...?

1096
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,850
Min Jian, ah, I'm sorry, it's such a hot day.
Xiu Min, no, I like to exercise after eating.

1097
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,990
Xiu Min, it's really good, I'm telling you
the truth. Min Jian, luckily you like it.

1098
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:06,270
Minjian: Who will you open your
heart to? Xiumin: Honest people?

1099
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,660
Minjian: I also like honest people.

1100
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:14,770
Xiumin: I like people who can express
themselves. Minjian: Yes, me too.

1101
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:19,550
Minjian: Are there people you
are interested in? Xiumin: Yes.

1102
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,480
Minjian: Here (headquarters)? Xiumin: Yes.

1103
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,010
Minjian: So fast? Xiumin: Yes.

1104
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:30,930
Xiumin, should I say it's a crush?
There's a brother I have a crush on.

1105
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,749
Minjian: Um... Xiumin: I'm so shy.

1106
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,300
So shy.

1107
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,460
Minjian: I see.

1108
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,350
Dongxu and Minjian's
two keychains are shaking.

1109
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,370
Minjian: Because I arrived late,
I think this is also inevitable.

1110
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,996
Minjian: But as we spend more time
together, if I start liking Xiumin more...

1111
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,460
Minjian, I will express it clearly.

1112
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,420
Dongxu, the current situation is (Xiumin).

1113
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,580
Dongxu, after a long time of
dating, the last one came back.

1114
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,660
Dongxu, are you having a great time?

1115
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:19,730
Dongxu, on the contrary,
I feel a little jealous.

1116
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:21,260
Dongxu, I hope she comes back soon.

1117
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,940
Dongxu, I'm going to the
dorm to pack my luggage.

1118
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,650
It's not why are you always.

1119
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,510
The wisdom and benevolence
left by Dongxu after leaving
It's not why are you always.

1120
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,730
The wisdom and benevolence
left by Dongxu after leaving

1121
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,830
Junrong, isn't the generously-sized
watermelon famous? Hurry and eat it

1122
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:49,180
There was still a slightly
embarrassing atmosphere

1123
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,300
Yooli, is it delicious?

1124
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,230
Yooli, it's great to see you.
I feel like it's going to be fun

1125
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,150
Inexplicably, carefully
look at the granary again

1126
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,640
Huiren, very embarrassed

1127
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,490
Huirun, I'm really worried.

1128
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:24,230
Liyuan, now it must be because of
embarrassment that she behaves like that.

1129
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,990
Liyuan, I want to get to know her better.

1130
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,940
-Let me guess your MBTI -I'll guess too.
Liyuan, let me guess your MBTI.

Not an ordinary person

1169
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:33,160
Yuli, do we have such a
person here? I didn't know.

1170
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,240
Huicheng, there is a sense of distance now.

1171
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,056
Yayan, it's different, it's different Yuri,

Put Huiren's keychain next to
the keychain given by Xiumin.

1178
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,720
Dongxu, to be honest,
I'm not feeling very well.

1179
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,370
Dongxu, I'm not sure if
it's because of Xiumin...

1180
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,680
What should he do...?

1181
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,190

But there are a lot of people.

1255
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,030
Yayan, have you eaten enough?

1256
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,300
Xiumin, come here.

1257
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,200
Xiumin, let's go out.
Yayan, do you want to go out?

1258
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,840
Mm-hmm.
Xiumin, let's go out.
Yayan, do you want to go out?

1259
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:42,980
Xiumin, let's go out.
Yayan, do you want to go out?

1260
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:44,500
Yayan, let's go out for a while.

1261
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,126
Xiumin, to the practice room.
Yayan, okay, to the practice room.

1262
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:54,290
Yayan, how is it? Xiumin,
um... it's pretty good.

1263
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,300
Xiumin, but I keep
thinking about someone else.

1264
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:01,500
Yayan, I understand. I think I
have a rough idea of who it is.

1265
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,740
Yayan, even the fact that person is going on
dates with other people makes you more concerned.

1266
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,510
Xiumin, what do you
think of the atmosphere?

1267
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:12,560
Yayan, what do you mean?
Xiumin, what do you think, sister?

1268
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:15,150
Me, I just went back to the dorm.

1269
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:15,390
Yayan, I just went back
to the dorm and had dinner.

1270
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,050
Had dinner.
Yayan, I just went back
to the dorm and had dinner.

1271
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,370
Yayan, I just went back
to the dorm and had dinner.

1272
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,266
Xiumin, what did you have for
dinner? Yayan, what about us?

1273
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,740
Yayan ate a lot, including
grilled meat and cold noodles.

1274
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:24,940
Yayan, how is the Minjian (民建)
group? Are they easy to get along with?

1275
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,180
How are the boys?
Yayan, how is the Minjian (民建)
group? Are they easy to get along with?

1276
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:26,450
Yayan, how is the Minjian (民建)
group? Are they easy to get along with?

1277
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,990
- Are they easy to get along with?
- Quite interesting.
Yayan, how is the Minjian (民建)
group? Are they easy to get along with?

1278
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,070
- Are they easy to get along with?
- Quite interesting.

1279
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:28,240
- Easy to get along with.
- Easy to get along with. Xiumin is easy to get along with.
- Are they easy to get along with?
- Quite interesting.

1280
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,519
- Easy to get along with.
- Easy to get along with. Xiumin is easy to get along with.

1281
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,780
Easy to get along with.

1282
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,280
Yayan, but you always think of others?

1283
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,140
Xiumin, that's actually true.

1284
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:35,500
Right?
Xiumin, that's actually true.

1285
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,140
Right?

1286
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,125
Xiumin, ah... I feel like
the atmosphere has changed.

1287
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:42,220
Right? I also felt it.
Yayan, I also felt it.

1288
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,760
Xiumin, it seems like he's
keeping his distance from me.

1289
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,520
Yayan, is it Dongxu?

1290
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,820
Yayan, he said he's not
in a good state right now.

1291
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,110
Xiumin, even during the
date, he's not in a good state?

1292
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,950
Yayan, yeah, that's what he said.

1293
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,500
Yayan Ah-ye~ Don't pay too much attention

1294
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:05,300
Yayan Work harder tomorrow,
show it more prominently

1295
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:08,230
Xiumin I feel like I can't
intervene between them anymore

1296
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,200
Yayan Don't take this matter too seriously

1297
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,380
Yayan Just think of it as making friends

1298
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,430
Here you go

1299
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,690
Yayan Since when did
it become sadder? Today?

1300
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,630
Su-min is not in the movie theater...

1301
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:25,520
In the movie theater.

1302
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,520
Today during the day, at the movie theater.

1303
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:36,749
Hui-ren, I am Hui-ren. I
will play with you today.

1304
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,820
Really?

1305
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:45,950
Su-min feels an indescribable emotion.

1306
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,310
Su-min is unable to focus
on watching the movie.

1307
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,490
Su-min doesn't know what they're thinking.

1308
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,170
Ya-yan, is Dong-xu here?

1309
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:05,150
Yayan, currently it is indeed impossible
to tell what everyone is thinking.

1310
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:09,130
But I hope you don't get too sad right now...
Yayan, but I hope you don't get too sad.

1311
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,720
Xiumin, I'm not sad right now, just...

1312
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:12,870
Yayan, do you feel upset?

1313
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:16,090
Yayan, honestly, it's definitely going
to be tough. I understand that feeling.

1314
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:20,000
Yayan, we got along so well yesterday, but
today I suddenly feel a sense of distance.

1315
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:22,220
Yeon, if it were me, I would also feel sad.

1316
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,220
Su Min, when did Dong Suk come
back? Yeon, when did he come back?

1317
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:29,750
Yeon, after we finish dinner,
it will probably take...

1318
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:32,600
Yeon, but he came back
much earlier than all of you.

1319
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,560
Yeon, so after he came back,

1320
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,106
Yeon, Hae Jin stayed
with us the whole time.

1321
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,260
Yeon, Dong Suk went back to his
room and took a rest before coming out.

1322
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,620
Yayan might be tired, the whole day.

1323
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,470
Yayan went out for the whole day.

1324
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,739
Liyuan, where is Yayan? Yuli,
Yayan went out with Xiumin.

1325
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,310
Why?

1326
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:55,300
Yuli just wanted to talk... I
don't know why they went out.

1327
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:55,890
-Ah, really? -Hmm.
Yuli just wanted to talk... I
don't know why they went out.

1328
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:56,680
-Ah, really? -Hmm.

1329
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,200
Dongxu went to find Xiumin.

1330
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,010
Yayan, do you want to go back?

1331
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,560
Xiumin, I'm going back to the dorm. Yayeon,
are you going back to the dorm too? Got it.

1332
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,740
Xiumin, I'm going back to sleep
first. Hmm hmm, you go ahead and sleep.

1333
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,519
Heard footsteps.

1334
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,780
You go back and sleep first.

1335
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,060
JaeJae: Oh! I'm here, I'm here.

1336
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,179
Ouch...

1337
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,350
The timing is just right, Dongxu!

1338
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,710
The one who can succeed
is the one who can succeed!

1339
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,969
What is this...?

1340
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,340
The timing couldn't be better

1341
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,790
Min, I'm going back to sleep
Yayan, mhm, you go sleep first

1342
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,309
Heard footsteps

1343
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,850
You go back and sleep first

1344
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,800
Yayan, have a good rest Min, mhm

1345
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,409
Dongxu, are you discussing some
secret? Yayan, no, we're done talking now

1346
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:47,770
- Have you finished talking? - Mm.

1347
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,060
Yayan, do you need to use the
practice room? Dongxu: Huh? I...

1348
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,246
Do you need to use the practice room?
Yayan, do you need to use the
practice room? Dongxu: Huh? I...

1349
01:08:49,246 --> 01:08:49,270
Yayan, do you need to use the
practice room? Dongxu: Huh? I...

1350
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,710
- I... - Rest well, Xiumin.
Yayan, do you need to use the
practice room? Dongxu: Huh? I...

1351
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:50,890
- I... - Rest well, Xiumin.

1352
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,020
- Dongxu - Dongxu Dongxu!!!!!!!

1353
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,969
What are you doing?!?!?!

1354
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,170
You should stop her.

1355
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,800
Dongxu!!!!!!!

1356
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:06,220
JaeJae, ah, can't we
bring Xiumin back again?

1357
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:08,100
Chuu Sooyoung walked too fast.

1358
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,866
JaeJae Shouldn't we grab his wrist immediately like this?
- Shouldn't we grab his wrist immediately like this? - That's what I'm saying.

1359
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:14,240
Jeongryeol Because Sooyoung just
cried and talked about Donghoo.

1360
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,640
Jeongryeol Maybe she's feeling shy now.

1361
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,680
She doesn't want him to see her like this.
Jeongryeol Maybe she's feeling shy now.

1362
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:16,746
She doesn't want him to see her like this.

1363
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:16,870
JaeJae's appearance might stun Dongxu.

1364
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,870
Her appearance.
JaeJae's appearance might stun Dongxu.

1365
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:17,910
JaeJae's appearance might stun Dongxu.

1366
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,290
-Might stun Dongxu. -That's what I mean.
JaeJae's appearance might stun Dongxu.

1367
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,500
-Might stun Dongxu. -That's what I mean.

1368
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,955
For Dongxu, JaeJae is
both stunning and "wow".

1369
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,100
All red.

1370
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,670
-With teary eyes. -It's so funny.
Chuu, it's so funny.

1371
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,200
My dear, could you check my blood pressure?

1372
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,290
Has it increased a lot?

1373
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:32,640
Love, now it has increased a lot.
Has it increased a lot?

1374
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,910
Love, now it has increased a lot.

1375
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:39,210
Xiumin left.

1376
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:10,690
Dongxu feels complex.

1377
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,826
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes. Less recording!
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes. Diary.

1378
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,240
Chuu must see her honest feelings.

1379
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:30,060
- What should we do?
- Wow, who will write it? HOWL Wow, who will write it?

1380
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:55,000
Xiumin also came to write Less Recording.

1381
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,570
Today's Shao Shao recording Today is the first time in
my life going to the cinema to watch a romantic movie.

1382
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:16,870
Dong Xu, this is my first time going to
the cinema to watch a romantic movie...

1383
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:24,920
Dong Xu, I couldn't help
but be moved to tears.

1384
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:44,990
The opposite-sex friend I like today.

1385
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,450
Who is the opposite-sex friend
who entered my heart today?

1386
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,170
I feel inexplicably uneasy in my heart.

1387
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:02,900
Various emotions arise, feeling very sad.

1388
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:06,160
Dongxu, because I'm not very
clear about Xiumin's feelings either.

1389
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,600
Dongxu even thought to
himself, "Should I give up?"

1390
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,760
Xiumin, I originally
wanted to chat with Dongxu.

1391
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,220
Xiumin, but I feel like he's avoiding me.

1392
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,640
Two people who used to be closer than anyone else.
- Happily looking-You too.

1393
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,500
In just one day, more
distant than anyone else.

1394
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,230
Three words that are
difficult to easily write down.

1395
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,720
Who is the person you like today?

1396
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,620
JunRong gege has always been kind
to me... I am very grateful to him.

1397
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:19,600
The opposite-sex friend I
like today is Kim JunRong.

1398
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:24,160
XiuMin wrote JunRong's name.

1399
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:33,910
The opposite-sex friend I like today.
DongXu did not write down anyone's name.

1400
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:38,186
The opposite-sex friend I like today. The opposite-sex friend I like today is Kim
JunRong. In this way, the feelings of the young boy and girl missed each other.

1401
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,510
I really can't understand boys at all.

1402
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,856
Yayan, I hope I can receive some
gifts, like a rabbit or a keychain.

1403
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,510
Liyuan, is there anyone who likes me?

1404
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,320
I really wish someone could tell me.

1405
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:49,496
Teenage boys are starting to express their
feelings. Expressing feelings through photos.

1406
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,801
Junrong, it really took me
20 minutes to consider coming.

1407
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,020
Chengyun, do you have any
opposite-sex friends you like?

1408
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,090
The first confession of a young boy.

1409
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,690
Yayan's mood... started to
change a bit from that time...

1410
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,596
Liyuan's reaction was very unexpected.

1411
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,330
Huiren: Ah, is this expressing a fondness?

1412
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,390
Huicheng: Can you play the
guitar? Liyuan: No, I can't.

1413
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,419
Come here.

1414
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,820
It's very fun, isn't it?

1415
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:12,610
The young boy starts
to move forward bravely.

1416
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,540
I am also very cautious.

I am also very cautious.

1418
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:17,256
Chengyun: It would be good to start
maturing now. Let's go for walks often.

1419
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,530
Minjian wants to know more about her.

1420
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,486
Huicheng will start liking her from now on.

1421
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:22,920
So beautiful.

1422
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,386
Xiumin's thoughts have
become a bit excessive.

1423
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,170
Dongxu, why?

1424
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:29,200
Xiumin, you should know too.
Didn't you anticipate it as well?

1425
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,806
Xiumin, I want to take a photo
with Junrong gege (older brother).

1426
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,230
With me? Okay, let's go.
- Is it with me? -Hmm

1427
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:38,660
Then let's go.
With me? Okay, let's go.
- Is it with me? -Hmm

1428
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,470
Then let's go.

1429
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:43,050
Xiumin, do you want to eat? Junrong, okay?

1430
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,480
Dongxu, she seems to have
changed since yesterday.

1431
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,730
Xiumin, feels very popular.

1432
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,120
Yayan, it's a secret. Dongxu, a secret?

1433
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,530
Xiumin, ah, it's me.

1434
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,410
Xiumin, Dingding, who wants to watch?

1435
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,216
-A good match, right? -Hmm
Is it a good match?

1436
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,460
Xiumin, I'm here to show off.

1437
01:14:55,930 --> 01:15:01,230
The heart is capable of changing.
