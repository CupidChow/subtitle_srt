1
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,330
After finishing the film camera
outing, Dongxu and Liyuan came back.

2
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,860
Liyuan, really... ah, you scared me.

3
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,200
Dongxu, ah, why do you always like to joke?

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,490
Dongxu, I really want to
imagine joking like Yunyi.

5
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:29,870
Alright.
Dongxu, I really want to
imagine joking like Yunyi.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:29,930
Alright.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,410
Liyuan, can I really fight with you?
Alright.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,070
Liyuan, can I really fight with you?

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,439
Dongxu, what do you want to do?
Liyuan, uh... ah, how terrifying.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,820
How scary.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,919
Huiran, huh? Huicheng is
Junrong... No, he isn't, right?

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
No, he isn't.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,310
- Isn't she his older sister?
- It seems like it, yeah. Huicheng and Huiran are back too.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,940
Liyuan Ah! It's Huicheng.

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,820
Dongxu Act a bit more natural.
Liyuan Ah, I'm going back.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,570
Just seeing Huicheng makes her feel shy.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,530
Huicheng What's up~

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,230
Hui Cheng, did you have fun?

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,790
Dong Xu, mmhmm. Hui
Ren, what did you guys do?

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,660
Li Yuan, ah, I have
something to ask Liu Dong Xu.

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,000
- So, I mean - Mmhmm.

22
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,630
Li Yuan, where are you going?
Hui Ren, to take this (photo).

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,950
Li Yuan, can't we not take it?
Dong Xu, let's talk while we walk.

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,910
Sister.
Li Yuan, can't we not take it?
Dong Xu, let's talk while we walk.

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,930
Li Yuan, can't we not take it?
Dong Xu, let's talk while we walk.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,930
Can't we not take it?
Li Yuan, can't we not take it?
Dong Xu, let's talk while we walk.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,340
Li Yuan, can't we not take it?
Dong Xu, let's talk while we walk.

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,930
Liyuan, so how does he think in his heart?

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,530
What?
Liyuan, so how does he think in his heart?

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,030
Liyuan, I can't guess at all.

31
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,540
Dongxu, first of all, I also
think Huicheng likes you, sister.

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,730
Dongxu, he will talk about
things you have done together, so...

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,966
Liyuan, I feel that when it's awkward,
words really do change a lot, right?

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,180
Liyuan, in order to not make
the other person feel awkward?

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,660
Um
Liyuan, in order to not make
the other person feel awkward?

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,180
Um

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,020
Lianyuan So I kept talking yesterday

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,760
Lianyuan But he only
talked about the seaside

39
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,400
Dongxu I'll go talk to him and
tell him to be more proactive

40
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,346
JaeJae It seems like Dongxu is not in the mood
to help others with their troubles right now...

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,450
Zhenglie This is what you're like now...
That's right

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,860
You're in trouble

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,850
Dongxu doesn't even know that his
own backyard is on fire right now...

44
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,316
Liyuan went to the resting room for a little while
in the morning But look, he doesn't say anything

45
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,270
Dongxu, I was like this a few
days ago, didn't Suimin come in?

46
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,010
Mm, mm Dongxu, do it like this

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,406
Liyuan, he was busy eating chicken
breast in the morning Dongxu, me?

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,980
Liyuan, no, no? Dongxu, ah~

49
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,730
This morning

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,370
Liyuan lingers around Huicheng

51
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
Yesterday, I...
Liyuan lingers around Huicheng

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,100
Liyuan lingers around Huicheng

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,460
- Look at me - Please taste it
Liyuan lingers around Huicheng

54
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,630
- Look at me - Please taste it

55
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,970
But Huicheng didn't say a word

56
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,720
Liyuan, he acted shy
in front of his friends

57
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,200
Liyuan, originally hoped he would take the
initiative to start a conversation but he didn't

58
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,035
Liyuan's mood is complicated

59
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,350
- Sister might feel frustrated - However,

60
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,720
Dongxu, sister might feel frustrated,
unable to understand Huicheng's intentions

61
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
However...
Dongxu, sister might feel frustrated,
unable to understand Huicheng's intentions

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,940
Dongxu, sister might feel frustrated,
unable to understand Huicheng's intentions

63
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,490
Dong Xu, hold on a little
longer and wait and see.

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,320
Hui Cheng is having a great time~

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
- Having a great time? - No, not really.

66
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,430
Li Yuan heard Hui Cheng's
voice and immediately reacted.

67
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,430
She came here, too.
Li Yuan heard Hui Cheng's
voice and immediately reacted.

68
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,860
Li Yuan heard Hui Cheng's
voice and immediately reacted.

69
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,470
- She came here! - She's here.
Li Yuan heard Hui Cheng's
voice and immediately reacted.

70
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,270
- She came here! - She's here.

71
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,950
Passing by Li Yuan, Hui Cheng
walked towards the kitchen.

72
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,630
Aww~ Can't take my eyes off.
- Can't take my eyes off. - Can't take my eyes off.

73
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,050
It's so mesmerizing that
I can't take my eyes off.
Aww~ Can't take my eyes off.
- Can't take my eyes off. - Can't take my eyes off.

74
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,910
It's so mesmerizing that
I can't take my eyes off.

75
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,920
Chuu, that was a genuine reaction just now.

76
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,310
Liyuan: Ha...

77
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,510
Liyuan: Look, he's doing it again.

78
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,460
Huicheng felt frustrated because he
couldn't find a topic to talk about.

79
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,460
OK.
Huicheng felt frustrated because he
couldn't find a topic to talk about.

80
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,100
Huicheng felt frustrated because he
couldn't find a topic to talk about.

81
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,100
Huiran: Ah, I'm curious
about what everyone did.

82
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,040
Dongxu: We really don't have much to say.

83
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,656
Liyuan: We had a great time. Dongxu: We had a
great time, but there's not much to talk about.

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,100
Did Huirun not eat? Liyuan Mm.

85
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,880
What
Did Huirun not eat? Liyuan Mm.

86
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,100
What

87
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,470
Have you eaten?

88
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,200
Dongxu, have you eaten? Hyunjin, yeah.
Have you eaten?

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,519
Dongxu, have you eaten? Hyunjin, yeah.

90
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Really?

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,210
Huiren said it's just the two of
us eating. Huicheng, is it true?
Really?

92
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,720
Huiren said it's just the two of
us eating. Huicheng, is it true?

93
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,860
Li Yuan, what did we eat? Huiren, is it us?

94
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,420
Li Yuan, what did you
eat? Hui Ren, is it us?

95
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,210
Huirén: The ham and egg
fried rice that I made.

96
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,130
Liyuan: How come? Did you make it
here and bring it along? Huirén: Yes.

97
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,000
Liyuan: You must have enjoyed it.

98
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,490
Huicheng is eating the leftover lunch box.

99
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,706
Huirén: Huicheng, sister wants you to teach her how to
knit. Dongxu: Huicheng, come over here for a moment.

100
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,160
Liyuan: Me? I have absolutely no idea.

101
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,660
- Sister asks you to teach her how to
knit sweaters - I'm going to take a shower

102
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,000
Liyuan avoided it

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,990
- Sister, sister, go out for
a while - Where are you going?
Liyuan avoided it

104
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,360
- Sister, sister, go out for
a while - Where are you going?

105
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,530
Liyuan Aiyoh

106
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,900
Liyuan could only sigh

107
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,140
Dongxu, come over here

108
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,400
Huicheng, what's the matter?

109
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,780
Huicheng, are you having fun?

110
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,780
Very...

111
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,030
Huicheng, is it awkward? Dongxu, I have
a strong feeling of being with you all.

112
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,860
Huicheng, are you too free?

113
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,690
Dongxu, Sister Liyuan is even
more interesting than I imagined.

114
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,476
Huicheng, you talk a lot, don't you?

115
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,299
Dongxu, hey you, I want to know
what you're thinking in your heart.

116
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
What?

117
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,010
Dongxu, who do you have a crush on now?

118
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,910
Huicheng, my heart is open to everyone.
Dongxu, is it open to everyone until now?

119
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,910
Yes.
Hmm.
Huicheng, my heart is open to everyone.
Dongxu, is it open to everyone until now?

120
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,510
Huicheng, my heart is open to everyone.
Dongxu, is it open to everyone until now?

121
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:24,960
So far

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,230
Huicheng, so far
Still don't know so far?
So far

123
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,560
Huicheng, so far
Still don't know so far?

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,050
Dongxu, so far, what about now?

125
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,870
Dongxu, currently there are people with
good feelings... Huicheng, what about now?

126
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,390
Yes
Dongxu, currently there are people with
good feelings... Huicheng, what about now?

127
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,870
Yes

128
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,820
Huicheng, I really think
everyone is quite good

129
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,590
Dongxu, I also feel the same way

130
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,460
Me too

131
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,900
Huicheng, you seem quite certain
Dongxu, me? Do I look certain?

132
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,040
Hmm.
Huicheng, you seem quite certain
Dongxu, me? Do I look certain?

133
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,140
Hmm.

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,976
Huicheng, that person always comes over to
show off to everyone. Dongxu, who is that?

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,030
Huicheng, that person.

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,770
Dongxu, who is that
person? Huicheng, Xiumin.

137
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,750
Chuu is so happy~
- I hate it - Too happy...

138
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,340
My mouth is smiling so
wide it reaches my ears.

139
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,100
Dongxu, is she showing off to you?

140
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,030
Huicheng, yeah, it seems like I'm
always present whenever she shows off.

141
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,100
Dongxu, what did she say? I'm very curious.

142
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,660
Huicheng, what do you think
about Xiumin? Do you like her too?

143
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,700
Dongxu didn't answer.

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,160
Dongxu, I want to talk to you. Youli, OK.

145
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,920
Youli, is she your ideal type?

146
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,246
Do you want to take a walk or... Dongxu
is curious about everything about Xiumin.

147
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,836
Dongxu, when will those two
people come back at the latest?

148
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,540
Yuli: Hmph! Are you jealous? Dongxu:
It makes one curious, doesn't it?

149
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:26,630
It makes one curious, doesn't it?

150
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,260
Yuli: Jealous, huh~ Dongxu: I
bet you're having a great time.
It makes one curious, doesn't it?

151
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,430
Yuli: Jealous, huh~ Dongxu: I
bet you're having a great time.

152
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,729
Yuli: Princess~ So Junrong
brother... Dongxu: I... I don't mind.

153
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,820
-Feeling jealous, huh? -I don't mind.

154
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,870
But his gaze always falls on the entrance.

155
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,640
Ah, you've arrived.
But his gaze always falls on the entrance.

156
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:39,870
But his gaze always falls on the entrance.

157
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,320
Just a little bit.
But his gaze always falls on the entrance.

158
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,780
But his gaze always falls on the entrance.

159
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,230
Oh no, what's going on?
But his gaze always falls on the entrance.

160
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,269
Oh no, what's going on?

161
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,360
I wonder if Xiumin has arrived.

162
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,480
- I bet you had a great
time. Now, what's - going on?
I wonder if Xiumin has arrived.

163
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,120
I wonder if Xiumin has arrived.

164
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,300
Dongxu, I have to see that scene.

165
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,040
Dongxu, the way Junrong and Xiumin
walked over together, it's real!

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,540
Yooli, ah, come on~ Are you jealous? Just a little
bit jealous? Dongxu: I feel like doing some sports (?)

167
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,690
So, a bit...
Yooli, ah, come on~ Are you jealous? Just a little
bit jealous? Dongxu: I feel like doing some sports (?)

168
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,620
Yooli, ah, come on~ Are you jealous? Just a little
bit jealous? Dongxu: I feel like doing some sports (?)

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,220
Yoo Ri, oh!? Is she here?
Dong Suk, no, I'm not curious.

170
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,570
Dong Suk, oh, she's here!

171
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,070
Quiet down, quiet down.

172
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,340
Dong Suk, you go and stay with Min Kwon, I'll
wait here for a while. Yoo Ri, got it, got it.

173
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,700
- What are you planning to do?
- Go and stay with Min Kwon.
Dong Suk, you go and stay with Min Kwon, I'll
wait here for a while. Yoo Ri, got it, got it.

174
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,240
Dong Suk, you go and stay with Min Kwon, I'll
wait here for a while. Yoo Ri, got it, got it.

175
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,890
Dong Suk is waiting for Soo Min.

176
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,820
Dong Suk, hey, hey, come over here.

177
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,500
Yori, isn't that her?
Dongxu, No... it's not.

178
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Ah, really...
Yori, isn't that her?
Dongxu, No... it's not.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,270
Yori, isn't that her?
Dongxu, No... it's not.

180
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,820
Playing basketball to
forget the agony of waiting.

181
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Like this.
Playing basketball to
forget the agony of waiting.

182
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,460
Playing basketball to
forget the agony of waiting.

183
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,026
Dongxu, Ah! Oh, missed...
Yori, Hold on, what's going on?

184
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,959
Dongxu, Ah, it's too far, too
far. Yori, What's going on...?

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Unexpectedly like this.

186
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,020
Dongxu, Got it! Ah... it's too close.

187
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,550
Yuli, no! Dongxu, I will keep
throwing until I hit the target.

188
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,790
Yuli, missed, missed! Dongxu, hit!

189
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,340
Missed, missed, missed.
Yuli, missed, missed! Dongxu, hit!

190
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,370
Missed, missed, missed.

191
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,340
Xiumin and Junrong have arrived.

192
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,959
Yuli, do you want to go in?
Dongxu, oh, let's proceed as usual.

193
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
OK.

194
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,790
Yuli, understood. See
you later. Dongxu, alright.

195
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,670
Xiumin, where should we take
the photo? Junrong, take a photo?

196
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,190
Junrong and Xiumin came
back with the remaining film.

197
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,336
Xiumin, how about taking it here? Shall we take it
here? Junrong, it should be nice to take it here, right?

198
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,590
Junrong, you try it. Xiumin,
make your face look bigger.

199
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,490
Junrong, make your face look bigger? Okay.
Yes.

200
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,886
Junrong, it looks good. Xiumin, is it
good-looking? I helped you take it, brother.

201
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,910
Alright.

202
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,910
Shumin, where is the poster?

203
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,510
Shumin, this one should look great.

204
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,120
Brother, this one should look great.

205
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,130
Shumin, how many are left?
Junrong, only one left.

206
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,070
Shumin, let's take a
photo with the little dog?

207
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Junrong, look at how it runs with its short
legs. Maybe we can come up with something.

208
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,810
Junrong, be careful. Shumin, okay.

209
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,790
Junrong: Aiyo, so happy! Aiyo, so happy!

210
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,660
Junrong: This isn't food. Is this a camera?
Xiumin: It seems like it thinks this is food.

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,520
Zhenglie: This is the first time
I've heard Xiumin speak like this.

212
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,100
That's right.
Zhenglie: This is the first time
I've heard Xiumin speak like this.

213
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,190
Zhenglie: This is the first time
I've heard Xiumin speak like this.

214
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,820
Chuu: It sounds really
loud. Is this Xiumin's voice?

215
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,116
Junrong: We've finished eating. After taking the pictures,
let's feed them before we leave. Xiumin: Yeah, let's do that.

216
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,510
Xiumin: They won't turn
out like this, will they?

217
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,570
Junrong: Come here, come to me.

218
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,556
Junrong: Haven't they
touched any dust? Xiumin: No!

219
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,740
Junrong: Let's feed them
before leaving. Xiumin: Okay!

220
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,580
Xiumin: It's so interesting.

221
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,280
Even the last piece of film is taken.

222
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,160
We should give them
something delicious to eat.
Even the last piece of film is taken.

223
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,690
Even the last piece of film is taken.

224
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,986
Xiumin: I want to capture the way you take
care of the little puppies, big brother.

225
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,490
It might feel a bit of a pity
to take photos with a cellphone.

226
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,400
Xiumin: Wow, is this a
photo of your boyfriend?

227
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,246
Xiumin: It really is a photo of your boyfriend. Junrong: I don't even
have a girlfriend, how could I have taken a photo of a boyfriend?

228
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,540
Xiumin: How is it? Don't
you think he's handsome?

229
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,490
Junrong: He's pretty good-looking.

230
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,060
Chengyun: Someone's back! Someone's
back! Yayan: Is someone back?

231
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,250
Yayan: No itching anywhere,
right? Chengyun: No.

232
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,490
Yayan, are you okay?

233
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,460
Chengyun, because my allergies are
not very severe. Yayan, but just in case.

234
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,779
Yayan, I just went to the pharmacy to
buy pain patches and also bought this.

235
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,110
-What? -Also bought this.

236
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,699
Yayan, in the future, when
rubbing or twisting, etc.

237
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,440
Really?

238
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:38,040
Yayan, if it itches, take
this. Chengyun, wow, thank you.

239
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,430
Cheng Yun: Is this an allergy
medication? Ya Yan: Allergy medication.

240
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,420
Cheng Yun: Thank you.
Cheng Yun: Is this an allergy
medication? Ya Yan: Allergy medication.

241
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,430
Cheng Yun: Thank you.

242
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,030
Cheng Yun: Thank you.

243
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,620
On the return trip in the car.

244
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,010
Touched an animal and my hands feel itchy.

245
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,650
Ya Yan: Can we go to the pharmacy quickly?

246
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,090
Ya Yan: I will be back soon.

247
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,279
Ya Yan: Hello, do you have any
medication for animal allergies?

248
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,140
Take one pill a day.

249
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,850
Yayan, one pill a day? Okay, thank you.

250
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,630
Yayan bought medicine for Chengyun.

251
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,970
Chengyun, won't you come back alone?
Yayan, really? Are we the first ones?

252
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,470
Chengyun, it can't be like
that. Yayan, is that so...

253
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,530
Yayan, let's put what needs to be
refrigerated in the refrigerator.

254
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,120
- After putting it like this, let's go.
- Okay.

255
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
Organize the snacks bought back.
- After putting it like this, let's go.
- Okay.

256
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,500
Organize the snacks bought back.

257
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Let's go, let's go

258
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,000
Yayan, take a break, see you later
Chengyun, goodbye~ see you later

259
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,610
Chengyun, Oh! It's Huicheng
Huicheng, you're back? Finally back

260
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,960
Chengyun, we went to a
farm Huicheng, really?

261
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,920
Huicheng, how was it there? Chengyun,
there? There were really a lot of animals

262
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,120
That's right
Huicheng, how was it there? Chengyun,
there? There were really a lot of animals

263
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,530
That's right

264
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:04,292
Huicheng, there were goats, there
were cows Chengyun, exactly, exactly

265
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,990
Huicheng, who did you go with?
Ya Yan? Cheng Yun: Yes, Ya Yan.

266
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,340
Huicheng, how was it?

267
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,540
Cheng Yun: Oh... it was fun.

268
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,630
Cheng Yun: What about you?

269
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,420
Huicheng: I won't tell you.
Cheng Yun: You're really boring.

270
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,610
Just kidding.

271
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
Huicheng: What do you think we did?

272
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,690
Cheng Yun: But if we went at four
o'clock, it felt like it was nearby.

273
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,440
What?

274
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,480
Did Chengyun go to a nearby place?
What?

275
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
Did Chengyun go to a nearby place?

276
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,389
Yeah, Hui Cheng said so.
Chengyun, tell me. Didn't I tell you?

277
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,630
- I know. Where did you go?

278
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:39,809
Curious about Hui Cheng and Hui Ren's outing.
We just brought lunchboxes over to eat.

279
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,610
Really?

280
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,530
Hui Cheng rode a bicycle there again.

281
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,780
Chengyun, really? Rode a
bicycle again? Is it fun?

282
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,900
Huicheng is fun and truly therapeutic.

283
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,650
The girls' dormitory is also talking about travel stories.
- Where did you go on a date? - The farm.

284
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:51,740
The farm?
The girls' dormitory is also talking about travel stories.
- Where did you go on a date? - The farm.

285
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,190
The farm?

286
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,240
What did Suimin do there?
Did she see the sheep?
The farm?

287
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,536
What did Suimin do there?
Did she see the sheep?

288
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,720
Yayan saw sheep, cows,
donkeys, chickens, and rabbits...

289
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,010
Is Lixuan making progress smoothly?

290
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,950
Yayan: Yeah, it's going pretty well.

291
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,540
Yayan, but now no matter how much I...

292
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,620
Yayan, I have said a lot of things...

293
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,500
Yayan, but I feel like he likes Huiren...

294
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,816
Yayan, as soon as I got there,
there was Kit Kat chocolate...

295
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,916
Yayan, it's also possible that
it's just my own perception...

296
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,616
Yayan, as soon as I
saw Kit Kat chocolate...

297
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,810
Yayan, then I said, "This is what Huiren
wants to eat," and took three of them.

298
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,670
Yayan: So I was like 'Ah... I see now...'

299
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,546
Yayan: Also, I feel like this
relationship should always...

300
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,050
Yayan: Put in a great deal of effort

301
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:34,140
Yayan: Both of them are a
bit introverted to begin with

302
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,340
Yayan: I feel like this
relationship won't be so easy

303
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,240
Discovered the snacks
bought by Sunghyun & Yayan

304
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,930
Found the favorite chocolate

305
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,630
Wait a moment

306
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,590
Kinder chocolate!!!
Kinder...

307
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,609
Chuu, how did you know and take it away?

308
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,020
Feeling so sad.

309
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,140
Zheng Lie, did you secretly
tell her? Did you send a message?
Feeling so sad.

310
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,170
Zheng Lie, did you secretly
tell her? Did you send a message?

311
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,500
That's what I mean.
Zheng Lie, did you secretly
tell her? Did you send a message?

312
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,540
That's what I mean.

313
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,680
JaeJae, don't we have a rule here that things are
not divided between you and me? Is there such a rule?
That's what I mean.

314
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,180
JaeJae, don't we have a rule here that things are
not divided between you and me? Is there such a rule?

315
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,490
Why not? Why?
JaeJae, don't we have a rule here that things are
not divided between you and me? Is there such a rule?

316
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:17,539
Why not? Why?

317
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,890
The first rule in the dormitory is to write
your name on the food in the refrigerator!

318
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,530
Of course
The first rule in the dormitory is to write
your name on the food in the refrigerator!

319
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:20,890
Of course

320
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,010
Zheng Lie, yes, yes Yes

321
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,460
Cheng Yun, Shi Hui Ren Ye, hello~

322
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,600
Cheng Yun, oh! This is the one I
bought Hui Ren, oh! You bought it?

323
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,010
Yes
Cheng Yun, oh! This is the one I
bought Hui Ren, oh! You bought it?

324
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,600
Yes

325
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,366
Cheng Yun, hehe Dong
Xu, why are you so happy?

326
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,860
Cheng Yun, oh dear, what...

327
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,750
Shi Hui Ren, look at this You Li, can I have
more Lotte chocolates? KitKat chocolates?

328
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,810
Can multi-benefits be achieved with Kendal?
Shi Hui Ren, look at this You Li, can I have
more Lotte chocolates? KitKat chocolates?

329
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,060
Can multi-benefits be achieved with Kendal?

330
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,369
Yayan, the one we bought.

331
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:41,460
Oh, really...

332
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,090
Hui Ren, I was thinking about whether to buy
it yesterday. This model was not available.
Oh, really...

333
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,110
Hui Ren, I was thinking about whether to buy
it yesterday. This model was not available.

334
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,110
That's what I'm saying.
Hui Ren, I was thinking about whether to buy
it yesterday. This model was not available.

335
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,270
Hui Ren, I was thinking about whether to buy
it yesterday. This model was not available.

336
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,930
Yayan, that's exactly the one they have!

337
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,320
Hui Ren, great!

338
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,630
Hui Ren, I really like that chocolate.

339
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,830
Hui Ren, remember this point.

340
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,530
On the way back from the
date with Huiran, Yayan

341
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,420
Huiran bought three boxes of that chocolate

342
00:14:58,421 --> 00:14:59,490
So...

343
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:02,540
This is the most touching thing
after coming to the headquarters

344
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,720
The secret attic that can
express one's true feelings is open

345
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,640
Yayan is recording a
little bit of today's events

346
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,640
Yayan is reminiscing about which moment?

347
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,230
This morning

348
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,209
Yayan can have ice cream
and also feed the animals.

349
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,330
Oh, okay.

350
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,960
Let's take it easy and take our time.

351
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,526
Yayan was just thinking how nice
it would be to have this opportunity.

352
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,810
Yayan, the opportunity has arrived.

353
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,230
Spent dreamlike time with Chengyun.

354
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
So adorable!

355
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,900
It's my lucky day to be able to go on a date with someone I
care about to a film camera (?) A day that summoned up courage.

356
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,080
Yayan, you go stand over there.
Chengyun, let's start with this shot.

357
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,260
- Direct shooting? - Yeah.
Yayan, you go stand over there.
Chengyun, let's start with this shot.

358
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,120
- Direct shooting? - Yeah.

359
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,010
Chengyun, shoot the cows first.

360
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,130
Chengyun's camera direction
is not "us" but "the animals".

361
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:23,920
That's great.

362
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:28,290
Yayan, mainly she always
shoots animals, so... yeah...

363
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,110
Yayan, but... how should I say it...

364
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,220
Yayan, he doesn't seem very happy.

365
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,900
Yayan, he is happy, but it's
like he just likes that place?

366
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,706
Yayan, you know what I mean?
Yuri, are you guys going to the farm?

367
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,366
Yayan, but it's really good, I
also really like going to the farm.

368
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,250
Yayan, he also really likes the animals.

369
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,839
Yayan, it really is a suitable place for
us. Youli, I understand what you're saying.

370
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Right?

371
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,170
Yayan, let's take a picture too.

372
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,380
Yayan, we only have 9
left. Chengyun, really?

373
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,140
Chengyun, we have too many
animals to take pictures of.

374
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,270
We have to use sparingly.

375
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:05,480
Time passes quickly like a film strip.

376
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,600
I will help you take videos.
Time passes quickly like a film strip.

377
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,900
Time passes quickly like a film strip.

378
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,960
Yayan clearly feels that I am
the only one interested in him.

379
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,530
Yayan treats me as a friend...

380
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,840
The opposite sex friend that I like today.

381
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,650
Yayan is in distress.

382
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,980
Zhenglie, don't write
anymore, don't write anymore.

383
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,960
Youqing, let's leave it empty today...

384
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,720
That's what I'm saying.
Youqing, let's leave it empty today...

385
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:56,960
That's what I'm saying.

386
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,920
Carefully write down a name.

387
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,590
Today, the opposite-sex friend I like is Cheng
Yun Ah, Ya Yan still wrote Cheng Yun today.

388
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,141
Sang Hun, because it's written as
"Cheng Yun Ah", it's even more sad.

389
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,810
Sang Hun, it's not "Cheng Yun" or
"Kim Cheng Yun", it's "Cheng Yun Ah".

390
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,810
Cheng Yun Ah.
Sang Hun, it's not "Cheng Yun" or
"Kim Cheng Yun", it's "Cheng Yun Ah".

391
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,200
Sang Hun, it's not "Cheng Yun" or
"Kim Cheng Yun", it's "Cheng Yun Ah".

392
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,286
Cheng Yun Ah. Chuu, but it
really feels so heart-wrenching.

393
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,330
Zheng Lie Wow...

394
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,770
Yu Qing Ah... this is
really heart-wrenching.

395
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,860
Today, the opposite sex
friend I like, Cheng Yun ah.

396
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,170
Ya Yan Because my
favorite is still Cheng Yun.

397
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,920
Ya Yan So I've liked him all along.

398
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,110
Cheng Yun Did you eat a lot? Hui Ren
We brought bento, did we leave at 4:30?

399
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,230
I heard.
Cheng Yun Did you eat a lot? Hui Ren
We brought bento, did we leave at 4:30?

400
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,269
I heard.

401
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,960
Cheng Yun 4:30? Hui Ren 4:30.

402
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,900
Chengyun: Oh, I see.

403
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,220
Chengyun: Didn't you say you made something?
Huiren: We went to the paddy fields.

404
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,690
Chengyun: They look huge, right?

405
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,590
Mm-hmm.

406
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,386
Chuu: They are completely
different, aren't they?

407
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,860
Shangxun: They are approaching in a completely
positive way, just like when approaching cows.

408
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:11,920
- Chengyun: Just like
when approaching cows.
Shangxun: They are approaching in a completely
positive way, just like when approaching cows.

409
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,230
- Chengyun: Just like
when approaching cows.

410
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:15,560
Youqing: You are a real man!

411
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,080
Chengyun, is it fun?

412
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,166
Huiren, I really came back quickly. I just
rode a bicycle for a while. Chengyun, really?

413
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,400
Chengyun, is it fun?

414
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,590
Huiren, did you go to the far…far…
Chengyun, went to see animals.

415
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,990
Yayan is watching...
Oh my goodness.

416
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,030
Huiren, with the animals? Chengyun, yes.

417
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,710
Huiren, and then the farm.
Chengyun, um, the farm.

418
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,316
Chengyun: I bought Kinder Chocolate
over there. Huiren: Well done.

419
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,386
Huiren: I heard you also
had ice cream. Chengyun: Yeah.

420
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,170
Zhenglie: Ah... I'm really going crazy.

421
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,070
Youqing: I can't bear to watch anymore.
Really.

422
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,690
JaeJae: It's really heartbreaking, really.

423
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,580
Yayan ate Ghana Chocolate.

424
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,590
Yayan: It's really delicious.

425
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,550
Junrong, come eat oranges. There are no
forks. Yayan, please eat with your hands.

426
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,160
Huicheng is weaving.

427
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,180
Huiren ate the Kinder
chocolate that Chengyun bought.

428
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,370
Yayan, why is this chocolate so delicious?
I think Ghana chocolate is delicious too!

429
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,780
Huiren, eat Kinder
chocolate! Kinder chocolate!

430
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,540
Yayan, I think Ghana chocolate
is even more delicious.

431
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,600
-That's right, that's right
Huiru, is that so?

432
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,750
Chengyun, are there no cat treats here? Is it below?
- What? -The cat treats are below

433
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,720
Huiru: Oh? They should be in my pocket

434
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,766
Huiru: Do you want to go and
give them treats? Chengyun: Yes

435
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,080
Gonna go give Dada treats

436
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,680
Healing for Yayan, but loyal to Huiru.

437
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Cure
Healing for Yayan, but loyal to Huiru.

438
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:49,690
Healing for Yayan, but loyal to Huiru.

439
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,280
That's right
Healing for Yayan, but loyal to Huiru.

440
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,300
Healing for Yayan, but loyal to Huiru.

441
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,080
Duixiao Ren ah
Healing for Yayan, but loyal to Huiru.

442
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,290
Duixiao Ren ah

443
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,460
There is love, it can't be stopped
now~ Something happened, what should we do

444
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
No way
There is love, it can't be stopped
now~ Something happened, what should we do

445
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,020
There is love, it can't be stopped
now~ Something happened, what should we do

446
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,880
Zhenglie, but Hui Ren is innocent
But Hui Ren is innocent, everyone

447
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,110
-He is innocent -That's right,
everyone knows JaeJae is innocent
Zhenglie, but Hui Ren is innocent
But Hui Ren is innocent, everyone

448
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,986
-He is innocent -That's right,
everyone knows JaeJae is innocent

449
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,450
Shangxun, in fact, Chengyun
did nothing wrong either

450
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,130
-Did not -That's right
Shangxun, in fact, Chengyun
did nothing wrong either

451
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,370
-Did not -That's right

452
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:04,880
JaeJae, we are just too
invested in Yaya's position.

453
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,950
No one did anything wrong~

454
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,300
Hui Ren, didn't see Dadad
today. Cheng Yun, really?

455
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,121
Hui Ren, did you see it? Cheng
Yun, no, I didn't see it today either.

456
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,640
Hui Ren, it's here.
Cheng Yun, yeah, it's here.

457
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,350
Cheng Yun, oh! It went out.

458
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,240
Stretching its lazy waist. Hui Ren,
oh? It's stretching its lazy waist.

459
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,556
Hui Ren, I want to take a picture with it.
Cheng Yun, do you want to help me take it?

460
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,780
Hui Ren, no, no. Take it in that photo
booth... It can never be captured, right?

461
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,619
Cheng Yun, I can hold it. I
held it once. Hui Ren, you try it.

462
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
Okay.

463
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Cheng Yun, click click~

464
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,400
Hui Ren, Oh! Let's go.

465
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,591
Hui Ren, but if it wants to go
down, let it go down. Cheng Yun, okay.

466
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,610
Hui Ren, hurry up and take the photo.

467
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,941
Hui Ren, use this one to take
it quickly. Seong Yun: Hmm.

468
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,990
Su Min and Dong Xu are taking a walk.
- Holding the camera and taking photos. - Hmm.

469
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,210
Dong Xu: Ah, I'm really curious...

470
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,590
Dong Xu: Did the two of
them have a happy day today?

471
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Su Min: How do you think it would be?

472
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,020
Dong Xu: What? Su Min: How
do you think it would be?

473
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,920
Dongxu: Mmm... Ah, well...

474
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,730
Dongxu: If you find it
interesting, that's good...

475
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,519
Dongxu: When I'm on a
date with my sister...

476
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Mmm.

477
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,176
Dongxu: When I'm on a date with my sister,
it seems like we're always talking about you.

478
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,360
Xiumin: What does my sister
say about me? Dongxu: You?

479
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,390
Dongxu: This? Hehe.

480
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,720
Dongxu: She said you
have a cute side, hehe.

481
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Me?
Hmm.

482
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,590
Dongxu, are you too charming?

483
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,810
Yayan, hmm? Why is sis alone here?

484
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,620
Liyuan, look, it's empty here.

485
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,210
What?
Liyuan, look, it's empty here.

486
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:38,440
Liyuan, look, it's empty here.

487
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,690
Because it's empty here.
Liyuan, look, it's empty here.

488
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:39,990
Liyuan, look, it's empty here.

489
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,720
Yayan, where did everyone go?

490
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,920
Yayan, do the three of us want
to take a photo? Liyuan, okay.

491
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,520
Junrong, do you want to bring the
guitar? Yayan, no, it's too much pressure.

492
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,300
Yayan, let's go!

493
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,910
Liyuan, where is Huicheng?

494
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,060
Junrong, I don't know~ Liyuan
was playing the piano just now.

495
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,900
The three of us with many worries have gathered together. I
have touched them once before, but I haven't touched them again.

496
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,210
Really?
The three of us with many worries have gathered together. I
have touched them once before, but I haven't touched them again.

497
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,900
Really?

498
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,509
Zhenglie, ah, yes, it's the three
of us with many worries~ It's true.

499
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,510
Yes.

500
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,740
Junrong, someone is here?
Yayan, it's Seonyun and Huirin.

501
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,150
There is nothing over there, huh.

502
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:15,710
Seong Yun and Hui Ren
are playing with Da Da.

503
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,710
They won't come out, huh.
Seong Yun and Hui Ren
are playing with Da Da.

504
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,870
Seong Yun and Hui Ren
are playing with Da Da.

505
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,630
Li Yuan, ah, we really...

506
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,760
Li Yuan, where did Mr. Hui
Cheng go? I want to talk to him.

507
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,110
-You go in the middle. -Me?

508
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,830
Ya Yan, has Sister Hui
Cheng returned to the room?

509
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,390
Li Yuan, did he go to
write Shao Shao's recording?

510
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,290
Liyuan: Hmm... What
should I choose? This one.

511
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,810
Liyuan: Hehe~ So cute!

512
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,970
Junrong: Let's take a close-up
photo. A close-up photo. Yayan: Okay.

513
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,780
Junrong: How did this happen!
It seems like there's no ink left.

514
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,770
There's no ink left, not even a drop.

515
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,770
What should we do?
There's no ink left, not even a drop.

516
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,760
There's no ink left, not even a drop.

517
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,660
Liyuan: Everyone is paired up now.
Huiren: Let's go together, sister.

518
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,920
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

519
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,930
Let's go to the lobby, to the lobby
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

520
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:06,950
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

521
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,950
The lobby?
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

522
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,220
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

523
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
I want to wash my hands
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

524
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,540
Liyuan, everyone has paired up

525
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,430
Me too

526
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,770
Junrong, Liyuan?
- Yes - I'm here

527
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,080
Junrong, it's a gift

528
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,490
Junrong, you took a good picture

529
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,410
Yayan, you've worked hard

530
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,260
Chengyun, aren't we going to the lobby?
Huirun, let's go to the lobby, should we go in?

531
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
Let's go to the lobby.
Chengyun, aren't we going to the lobby?
Huirun, let's go to the lobby, should we go in?

532
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,610
Chengyun, aren't we going to the lobby?
Huirun, let's go to the lobby, should we go in?

533
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,120
Yayan, sister must be
tired, right? Li Yuan: Mmm.

534
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,480
Yayan, shall I dance for you? Watch.

535
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,490
Yuli: Sister! Li Yuan: Mmm.

536
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,170
Yuli: Yayan? Yayan: Yes~

537
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,800
Yuli: Did you take photos?
Yayan: Yes! But the thing is...

538
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,570
Mmm.

539
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,279
Yayan: There's no ink.

540
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,000
What is a talking elephant?

541
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,310
Chengyun said there is
no ink left. Huirun, what?

542
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,590
Understood.
Chengyun said there is
no ink left. Huirun, what?

543
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,660
Chengyun said there is
no ink left. Huirun, what?

544
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,940
Chengyun, is there no more ink? Yayan, it
can't be printed. It comes out as blank paper.

545
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
Can't print?
Chengyun, is there no more ink? Yayan, it
can't be printed. It comes out as blank paper.

546
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,720
Chengyun, is there no more ink? Yayan, it
can't be printed. It comes out as blank paper.

547
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,710
Huirun, we almost had a big problem.
Chengyun, huh? We are the last one.

548
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,970
Everyone, goodbye. Chengyun, goodbye.

549
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,330
Yayan, I feel happier now that
I understand Chengyun better.

550
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,450
Yayan is very happy to
have such an opportunity.

551
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,770
Yayan feels that today's date is very good.

552
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:21,100
Yayan, however, feels like he
is more interested in animals...

553
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,170
It feels like "maybe it's like that"...
They are all small animals after all.

554
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,910
Actually, I've been trying to talk to him.

555
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,980
Yayan feels very determined
to continue the conversation.

556
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,790
Of course he will.
Yayan is a little tired.

557
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,759
Yayan, I am not a very outgoing type.

558
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,930
But you are very considerate.

559
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,990
Yayan, it seems like he is
really not interested in me.

560
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,419
Yayan, it looks like he likes another girl.

561
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Yeah, that's right.

562
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,970
Hui Ren, after taking the
picture, immediately jumped down.

563
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,510
Hui Ren walked out of
Cheng Yun's arms by itself.

564
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,030
Yuli, but where is it? I opened that (Dada's
nest) this morning, but it's not there.

565
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,840
Hui Ren is in the burrow at night.

566
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,830
Yu Li has been looking for him all morning.
He thinks maybe he's somewhere else...

567
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
Da Da is really good-looking...

568
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,420
Eh, I should go now...

569
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,950
I'm leaving! I feel like I'll
be back late. Turn off the lights.

570
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,400
Just go to sleep with the lights
off. Ya Yan: Don't come back too late.

571
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,760
Yuli went to practice vocal music.

572
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,860
Only Yayan and Huiren are left.

573
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,750
I'm going to take a shower.
Only Yayan and Huiren are left.

574
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:30,970
I'm going to take a shower.

575
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,010
Where are you going?

576
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:38,030
Yayan, do you have a crush
on anyone? Huiren, kind of.

577
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,050
Yayan, Seonyoon?

578
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,370
Yayan, I am... I am Seonyoon too.

579
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,940
Yayan, but we talked a lot today.

580
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,730
Huiren, but it doesn't feel like it, right?

581
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,490
Huiren, it's not about whether
the personality is good or not.

582
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,320
Huiran feels that whether we are
compatible or not is very important.

583
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,590
Yayan, although satisfied with the appearance,
but the personality is not compatible.

584
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,260
Yayan, he is very interesting but...

585
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Yayan, both of us are a bit
shy...? And quite introverted.

586
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,620
Yayan, so there are some...

587
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,290
Yayan, there are many areas
that are not harmonious.

588
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,140
Yes, I can see that.
Yayan, there are many areas
that are not harmonious.

589
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,360
Yes, I can see that.

590
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,740
Hmm.

591
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:25,090
When everyone is together and when it's just
the two of us, it feels different. Yayan: Yes.

592
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,256
Yayan, but when everyone is
together, Chengyun and I are a bit

593
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,180
Yayan, not harmonious, so...

594
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,080
Huiren, when everyone is together,
Chengyun really doesn't say a word.

595
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,030
Yayan, it's also awkward when he's with me.

596
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,016
Yayan, but I found that when
I'm with you, it's not like that.

597
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,450
Yayan, so when I saw that
today, I deeply empathized.

598
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,240
Yayan Ah... So it turns
out... Do I like someone or not

599
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,980
Yayan You can tell from
these places, so I...

600
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,250
Yayan I don't know either...

601
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,020
Zhenglie Ah...

602
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,800
Youqing It really hurts so much

603
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,940
Yesterday
Then I will go by myself

604
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,540
No, don't
Yesterday
Then I will go by myself

605
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:06,610
No, don't

606
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:06,620
Yuli Does anyone want to go with
Huirun (to the convenience store)?
No, don't

607
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,776
Yuli Does anyone want to go with
Huirun (to the convenience store)?

608
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,730
Chengyun Is there no one? Then I'll go

609
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,420
Scared by the sight that
looks different from usual

610
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,890
Yayan looked back several
times at the leaving Chengyun

611
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,380
Then sat alone and daydreamed

612
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,146
Yayan, in the past, I wouldn't
make it too obvious when I had a crush

613
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,600
Yayan, I liked someone on my
own, and it would just end there

614
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,280
Yayan, so... seizing the
opportunity is a bit difficult for me

615
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,510
Yayan, should we tidy up this place?

616
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,050
It's not the style of the boy
I like, but the way he dresses.

617
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,860
Right.

618
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,610
This is done directly.

619
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,420
Yayan, let me try it.

620
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,130
Yes.

621
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:00,720
Yayan, because I haven't tried it before,
I don't know how it will turn out, right?
Yes.

622
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,966
Yayan, because I haven't tried it before,
I don't know how it will turn out, right?

623
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,190
Yayan had previously thought
about mustering up the courage again.

624
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,190
Pull it over here.
Yayan had previously thought
about mustering up the courage again.

625
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,300
Yayan had previously thought
about mustering up the courage again.

626
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,570
It should be fine.
Yayan had previously thought
about mustering up the courage again.

627
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,140
Yayan had previously thought
about mustering up the courage again.

628
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,940
And then today

629
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,700
Yayan, for the last
time, so as not to regret

630
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,490
Yayan gathered up
courage and approached him

631
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,966
Yayan: "Let me take the photo for
you." Chengyun: "No, no, no need."

632
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,246
Chengyun: "Ah, go ahead,
I'll take it for you."

633
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,286
Yayan: "Tell me how to pose."
Chengyun: "I really don't know."

634
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:24,240
Yayan: "But still, I can feel
that he has no feelings for me."

635
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,820
Yayan thinks that it would be better
to be friends with Chengyun instead.

636
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,650
Yayan, starting from now,
I will also be a friend.

637
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,670
Yayan, let's get along well with
Chengyun. This is what I want more.

638
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,340
Yayan entered her sleep
with mixed emotions.

639
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,970
Chengyun took a walk.

640
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,150
Chengyun also came to Tuantuan
& Yunyun Amusement Park today.

641
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,160
Chengyun started with Yunyun first.

642
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,140
Chengyun, no, Tuantuan don't...

643
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,810
Chengyun, Tuantuan, wait a moment.

644
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,170
Chengyun, Tuantuan, I'll come back later.

645
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,940
Chengyun, I'll come back later, okay?

646
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,350
After greeting Tuantuan,
Chengyun and Yunyun ran off.

647
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,610
Chengyun, did you sleep well?

648
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,390
Chengyun kept running for a while.

649
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,370
Then Chengyun arrived at another boy
in the Tuantuan & Yunyun amusement park.

650
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,380
Huicheng, although I'm afraid of
the heat, I still came to find you~

651
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,260
Huicheng, where did Yunyun go?

652
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,530
Huicheng, where did Tuantuan go?

653
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,520
I am Tuantuan.

654
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,430
Huicheng, come here.

655
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,970
Huicheng, Yunyun! Yunyun...

656
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,390
Huicheng, is it Yunyun? Tuantuan.

657
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,010
Huicheng, is it Yunyun or Tuantuan?

658
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,420
Huicheng still can't distinguish
between Tuantuan & Yunyun.

659
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,060
Huicheng, let's become closer.

660
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,690
Huicheng, wait a moment, wait a moment.

661
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,350
Huicheng, it's tuantuán, right? Isn't it?

662
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,140
Huicheng finally called
tuantuán by the right name.

663
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,990
Chengyun: Hey Huicheng.
Huicheng: Ah, what is it?

664
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,120
Huicheng: I just thought of taking it for a
walk, so I came. Chengyun: Let's go together.

665
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,850
Chengyun: Now it's tuantuán's turn, so I
thought of taking it out. Huicheng: Ah, really?

666
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,850
They obediently follow, yeah.
Cheng Yun: Yeah, let's go.

667
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,290
Let's go, Cheng Yun.

668
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,720
Yeah, we can go shopping twice.

669
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,310
JaeJae hit the jackpot... the dog is lucky.

670
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,570
Is Huicheng always so quiet? Chengyun,
Tuantuan should also run around.

671
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,760
Chengyun, run in circles!

672
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,270
Huicheng, don't you run, too?
Chengyun, I will run as well.

673
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,410
Huicheng, ah wait... just wait a moment.

674
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,960
Huicheng, oh wow, you run so well.

675
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,370
The two boys run together.

676
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,600
Chengyun, run again, run
again! Huicheng, okay, okay~

677
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,890
Huicheng, wow, look at the scenery.

678
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,870
It's really nice.

679
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,770
Huicheng, this kind of nature is really rare. Chengyun,
yes, we don't usually have the chance to see it.

680
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,399
Huicheng went for a morning
run and feels much better.

681
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,870
Yes.

682
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,050
Huicheng, that's great, huh?
Yes.

683
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,260
Huicheng, that's great, huh?

684
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,410
Huicheng, I didn't even know.

685
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,360
Huicheng, it's already the
sixth day, right? Chengyun: Yeah.

686
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,050
Huicheng, time flies by so fast.

687
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,210
Chengyun: There's not much
time left, feeling a bit uneasy.

688
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,060
Chengyun: Is that so? Huicheng: Yes.

689
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,420
Yayan: I started adjusting
again since yesterday.

690
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,600
Liyuan, why did you give up?

691
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,940
Yayan, no, sister. But I feel
like I also have a chance now.

692
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yayan, she also talked a
lot, so it's pretty good.

693
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,730
Yayan, I... gave it my all yesterday.

694
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,100
Yes, I saw that.

695
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:43,460
Yayan is really handsome.

696
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,120
JaeJae should learn from her.
I saw that.

697
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,120
Liyuan, Yayan, I hope you'll
do better and better. Yayan, me?

698
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,210
Liyuan, why are you so
lacking in confidence?

699
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:05,060
Yayan, me?

700
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,850
Yayan, from today on, I'll
try to understand new people.

701
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,980
Very good.
JaeJae, what if that person is Huicheng?

702
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,229
Zhenglie, that's so
interesting, so interesting.

703
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,440
- So interesting. - Really?

704
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,030
Received a message.

705
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,199
You can start a 1:1 secret conversation
now. Please choose the person you like.

706
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,630
- Of course we should come back together.
- Yeah.

707
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,890
The young boys and girls
who came to the secret space.

708
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,010
The young boys and girls
who want to share secrets.

709
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,200
Because I want to know your thoughts, that's why
I want to have a secret conversation with you.

710
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,956
Since it's a secret conversation,
just tell me, how are you doing?

711
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,070
So, who do you like?

712
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,540
The 1:1 secret conversation between
the young boys and girls has started.

713
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,380
Xuan Yayan.

714
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,270
Liu Dongxu.

715
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,230
Cui Hui Ren

716
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,120
Kim Su Min

717
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,070
Liang Hui Cheng

718
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,070
Zheng You Li

719
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,020
Park Min Jian

720
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,120
Kim Sung Yun

721
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,880
Kim Li Yuan

722
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,150
Kim Jun Rong

723
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,840
Young Resting Room, Training Room, Dormitory,
Attic, Consulting Room, Personal Practice Room

724
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,810
Teenagers in Love

725
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,540
Episode 6: What is Love?

726
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,680
1:1 Secret Conversation,
the first applicant is Hui Ren

727
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,130
Zhenglie, will they
brazenly call for someone?

728
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,666
Zhenglie, or will they just bring the
people around to inquire about the news?

729
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,620
Youqing, ah~ it's also possible.

730
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,220
Zhenglie, ah~ this
must be very interesting.

731
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,690
Who is the young man
that Huiren is waiting for?

732
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,380
A young man came over.

733
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,840
Huiren, hello.

734
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,960
Huiren's conversation partner is Junrong.
Hello.

735
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,126
Shangxun, this story really fascinates me, ah. I find
it very interesting. This story really attracts me.

736
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,400
You Qing, why did you come here?

737
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,830
- Going crazy. - What's going on?
You Qing, why did you come here?

738
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,090
- Going crazy. - What's going on?

739
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:07,580
What's going on?

740
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,160
Jun Rong, hello.

741
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,866
Jun Rong, why did you summon me?
Hui Ren, why did you summon him...

742
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,710
Hui Ren, because I've
talked with you the least.

743
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,030
Hui Ren, that's why I summoned you.

744
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,880
Hui Ren -> Jun Rong

745
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:33,920
Hui Ren So I don't know what to say...
I talk to my brother the least anyway

746
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:39,250
Hui Ren I have talked to others
individually... just haven't talked to you

747
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,250
Jun Rong So who do you like?

748
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,219
Suddenly curious about
the base of the desk lamp

749
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
About me

750
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,740
Don't you know?

751
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,890
Hui Ren About me...

752
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,910
Huirun, don't you know? Junrong, Chengyun?

753
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,630
Junrong, Chengyun?

754
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,780
Huiren, what about your older brother?
No one really knows what he thinks.

755
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,980
Huiren, ah, you do have
someone you like, right?

756
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,726
Huiren, this surprises me a bit... Ah, but
I think I have a rough idea of who it is.

757
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,320
Huiren, because there are two people...

758
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,020
Huiren, it must be one of these
two for sure. Junrong: It's possible.

759
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,610
Hui Ren, isn't it two people? Jun Rong, no.

760
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,490
Hui Ren, it should be
either Yo Li or Ya Yan, right?

761
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,799
Hui Ren's intuition is pretty bad.

762
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Well...

763
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,336
Hui Ren, because it's a secret... a secret conversation, can you just
tell me how it is? Jun Rong, Ah, because it's a secret conversation.

764
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,930
Hui Ren, I absolutely won't say it.

765
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,980
Jun Rong, actually, I like Xiuhui.

766
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,050
Huirén and Xiumin, right? Ah~ Baby bunny?

767
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,010
Huirén and Xiumin are really adorable.

768
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,350
Huirén, ah, the older brother should
also be like that, be more proactive.

769
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,110
Shangxun, Huirén, he
tried everything yesterday~

770
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,630
That's right, tried everything yesterday.
Shangxun, Huirén, he
tried everything yesterday~

771
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,156
That's right, tried everything yesterday.

772
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,790
Not when it's your turn
to come up with ideas.

773
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,250
Shangxun, yesterday was
incredible, didn't you see?
Not when it's your turn
to come up with ideas.

774
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,830
Shangxun, yesterday was
incredible, didn't you see?

775
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,960
Love, yes, it's okay.

776
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,586
Junrong, but I have to consider Dongxu's
feelings, so it's really difficult.

777
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:06,230
But I can't just give up like this.

778
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,460
Junrong, but I've been with
Dongxu for a longer time.

779
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,570
Junrong, I've been with
Dongxu for a longer time...

780
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,900
Huiren, that's true... but you should
still tell her, "Let's go for a walk."

781
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:22,500
Junrong, I'll give it a try.
Dongxu, no... I'm going crazy.

782
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,196
Junrong, I went on a date with Xiumin, but I always have
to consider Dongxu's opinion... Huiren: Ah, yeah, I see.

783
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,316
Junrong, I always pay attention to Dongxu's
expressions. Did Xiumin say anything?

784
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,800
Huiren: Xiumin? She's
always concerned about Dongxu.

785
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,560
Huiren: Brother, you should have shown your
feelings from the beginning, just like Dongxu did.

786
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:47,080
Junrong: During our last class, when we were drawing, I thought
she would be there, and I thought Xiumin would be there too.

787
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,966
Junrong: But I didn't expect Liyan to be there.
Huiran: Ah, because I don't know what her major is?

788
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,646
Junrong: Hmm, because we didn't
know each other's majors at first.

789
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,670
I think maybe that's
where the problem started.

790
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,450
The course of one day.

791
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,190
The paths of two young
men are completely opposite.

792
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,090
It was Shaonan Dongxu who
found Xiumin majoring in.

793
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,300
So it turns out to be piano.
It was Shaonan Dongxu who
found Xiumin majoring in.

794
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,500
It was Shaonan Dongxu who
found Xiumin majoring in.

795
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,610
I major in piano.
It was Shaonan Dongxu who
found Xiumin majoring in.

796
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:06,630
I major in piano.

797
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,356
Huiran, were Dongxu and Xiumin together at
that time? Junrong, yes, except for that.

798
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,540
Junrong, and also on the first day,
they went for a walk with the dog together.

799
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,840
Huiran, so timing is crucial.
Junrong, ah... there's nothing I can do.

800
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,519
But it's not over yet.

801
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,786
Tell her today, let's go for a walk.

802
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,000
Tell her to go cycling.

803
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,460
Hui Ren, I will tell you when the
timing is better. Jun Rong, okay.

804
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,410
Jun Rong, I will try my best.
Keep it up! Hui Ren, let's go out.

805
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,880
It feels like a gift
for meeting each other.

806
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,250
Ya Yan, our photos are
out. Cheng Yun, really?

807
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,020
Ya Yan, yes. They came out in just one day.

808
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,276
Hui Cheng, should I just go
ahead and look at all of them?

809
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,120
Where are you?

810
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:55,660
Liyuan, don't look at mine!

811
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,060
Liyuan, don't look at mine (?)
Chengyun, can these be looked at?

812
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,640
Huicheng, we have exactly 27
of them. Yayan, let's see ours.

813
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,939
Yayan, actually I've already
seen them in advance. Chengyun, ah.

814
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,749
Yayan, because I had a strong desire to see
them, my fingers are a bit out of control (?)

815
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,010
This one is taken very well.

816
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:11,900
Chengyun: Wow, this photo was taken really
well. Yayan: Ah, but... look, look at this one.
This one is taken very well.

817
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,549
Chengyun: Wow, this photo was taken really
well. Yayan: Ah, but... look, look at this one.

818
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,196
Yayan: You know, cut it out and use it, okay? Cut
it out and use it, oh. Chengyun: Hahaha, okay.

819
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,790
Chengyun's little recording.

820
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,339
Chengyun: At first, I was a bit shy.

821
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,539
Chengyun: Yayan is really nice.

822
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,809
Chengyun: When I'm tidying
up, she comes over to help me.

823
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,610
Chengyun: When I'm washing dishes,
she also comes over to help me.

824
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,550
The person is very kind.

825
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:53,089
In Chengyun's heart, Yayan is a 'good person'. Kind, likes
dogs, often helps with tidying up, very nice to everyone.

826
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,389
Chengyun, I think Yayan is...

827
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,790
Chengyun, it seems like
she's interested in me.

828
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,759
At that moment, I understood.

829
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,239
Yayan just went to the pharmacy to
buy ointment, she also bought this.

830
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,910
Chengyun: Wow, thank you. Is this allergy
medicine? Yayan: Yes, it's allergy medicine.

831
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,909
Thank you.

832
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,180
Chengyun realized Yayan's
affection at this time.

833
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,959
What should I do?

834
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,669
Chengyun, if I make a mistake
now, it might hurt Yayan.

835
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,200
Chengyun feels very sorry.

836
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,970
My mind is in chaos.

837
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:56,180
What should I do? How should I act? I am truly
sorry, Chengyun feels 'sorry' for Yayan's feelings.

838
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,260
Chengyun, Xiaolu is really beautiful.
Yayan, Xiaolu is super beautiful.

839
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,780
Yayan, do you like it? Is it
well-shot? Chengyun likes it.

840
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
Huicheng: Ah~ Ah, look
at the one taken by Huiren.

841
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,969
Yayan: That's not because
he can't take photos.

842
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,779
Yayan: It's just that he
doesn't know how to take them.

843
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,719
Huicheng: Come here. Huiren: Ah, I see~

844
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:21,940
You sit here.

845
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,610
Huicheng: You sit here. Huiren: Ah...
um... the one with the finger captured.
You sit here.

846
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,149
Huicheng: You sit here. Huiren: Ah...
um... the one with the finger captured.

847
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,279
Hui Cheng, I have to teach you a lesson.

848
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,680
Hui Ren, there's clearly
no shooting footage, right?

849
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,030
Ya Yan, did you style your hair cool today?

850
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,346
The day before, Jun Rong
and Xiu Min went on an outing.

851
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,450
Jun Rong, what hairstyle should I do
tomorrow? I'll take your recommendation.

852
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,740
Xiu Min, tomorrow, comb your
hair up and show your forehead.

853
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,995
Jun Rong, all of it up? Xiu
Min: Yeah, do it all back!

854
00:46:57,996 --> 00:46:59,030
All back, ah.

855
00:46:59,031 --> 00:47:00,750
This morning.

856
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,480
Zheng Lie, let him do whatever he wants?

857
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,790
- Very pretty.
- Let him do whatever he wants.
Zheng Lie, let him do whatever he wants?

858
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,470
- Very pretty.
- Let him do whatever he wants.

859
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,000
Chuu Ah~ So it looks a little good today.

860
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,690
Hui Cheng, brother, the photos have been developed.
Jun Rong, have the photos been developed?

861
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,579
Cheng Yun and Xiu Min, let the two of them take a
look. Jun Rong, that's definitely the way to go.

862
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,339
Hui Cheng, you all must
have taken great pictures.

863
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,660
Yayan, no matter how we take the photo,
Huicheng, I'm really looking forward to it.

864
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,140
Xiumin, I think it's
better to let my hair down.

865
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,420
Xiumin, is it better to
tie it up? Or let it down?

866
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,629
Junrong, it's better to let
it down. Xiumin, okay, I got it.

867
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,430
Junrong, did we take it well? Xiumin, hmm.

868
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,680
Junrong, this background is
not bad, right? Xiumin, hmm.

869
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,010
Xiumin, what am I looking at?

870
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,580
Junrong, perhaps the sea?

871
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:15,490
Junrong, I also don't
know what I'm looking at.

872
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,520
Huiren, it's not about how others see
you, it's about how you present yourself.

873
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,700
Huicheng, are you talking about yourself?

874
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Xiumin, let's quickly
flip through my photos.

875
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,850
Please flip through them quickly.

876
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,339
Junrong, but quite sensitive.

877
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,010
Xiumin, yes, this hand does not cover you.

878
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,150
Junrong, couple outfit, a commemoration.

879
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,949
Xiumin, where should we look?

880
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:53,530
Is it here?

881
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:53,660
Xiumin, wait a moment, wait a
moment, wait a moment, wait a moment.
Is it here?

882
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,029
Xiumin, wait a moment, wait a
moment, wait a moment, wait a moment.

883
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,570
Xiumin, ah, wait a
moment, this can be deleted.

884
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,140
Xiumin, ah, what is
this, what is this, haha.

885
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,339
Xiumin, sister, I don't seem
to look good in the photo.

886
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,900
Xiumin, taken with that camera...
Junrong, whose camera is this?

887
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,449
Yayan, we bought it. Let's play
OneCard game. Junrong, really?

888
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,710
Junrong, not bad.

889
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,390
Junrong, choose one, take a look yourself.

890
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,736
Xiumin, should I look at it?
Junrong, hmm, take a look yourself.

891
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,989
Junrong, did you see it? Xiumin, yes.

892
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,070
Junrong, give it to me.
Xiumin, how do we play this?

893
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,700
Junrong, place this here.

894
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,000
Junrong, do you have a favorite
sentence? Just say one randomly.

895
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,109
Junrong, do you like strawberry milk?

896
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,680
Xiumin, no, not strawberry
milk. I'm not that girly...

897
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,150
Xiumin, what am I saying? Let's
just go with ginseng chicken soup.

898
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,900
Ginseng Chicken Soup
Junrong Ginseng Chicken Soup Xiumin Hmm

899
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,759
Junrong This is your card.

900
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,690
Xiumin Wow, what is
this? How did you do it?

901
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,766
Junrong Our hearts are connected. Our hearts
are connected. Li Yuan Isn't it super cute?

902
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,100
What happened?

903
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,410
Yayan Look at her expression.
Li Yuan Don't scare her.
What happened?

904
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,859
Yayan Look at her expression.
Li Yuan Don't scare her.

905
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,470
Xiumin Isn't it... taken out?

906
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,799
Junrong, don't tell her, don't
tell her Yayan, I don't know

907
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,039
Junrong, I'll show you something
interesting Look, you say 'stop'

908
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,510
Yayan, I'm getting interested

909
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,439
Yayan, Xiumin, don't be
fooled by this kind of thing

910
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,560
Liyuan, Xiumin, if a man uses this kind
of thing You can't be fooled like that

911
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,590
Liyuan, so cute

912
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,380
Yayan: Everyone is so
good at taking photos.

913
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,889
Liyuan: I initially thought Dongxu
was really good at taking photos.

914
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,400
Liyuan: Turns out, he
just knows how to pose.

915
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,670
Yayan: Did he come from the dorm?

916
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,340
- He's here - Dongxu is here.

917
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,140
Dongxu finally made his entrance.
- His entrance - Oh, it's Dongxu.
- He's here - Dongxu is here.

918
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,599
Dongxu finally made his entrance.
- His entrance - Oh, it's Dongxu.

919
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,070
JaeJae: He seems quite cheerful.

920
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,350
Chuu: Oh my goodness, a love triangle.

921
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,460
Dongxu, this is a photo taken yesterday.

922
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,560
The photo I took with Xiumin disappeared.

923
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,969
Xiumin, sister, let's take a
photo together. Yuli, with me?

924
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,300
Yuli, let's go.

925
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,900
Yuli, come over here too.
Yayan, hurry up and come.

926
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,540
Yuli, is there something you
want to say to me? Xiumin, no.

927
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,950
Dongxu, we should also take a photo, bro.

928
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,949
Shangxun, Dongxu, yesterday both of
you dressed up as princess and prince!!

929
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,320
Love is, yes, they are all
going on their honeymoon!

930
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,400
Girl's dormitory

931
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,469
Su-min, speaking of
which, why did Dong-xu...

932
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,370
Su-min, no, why did big brother Dong-xu take out the photo
we took together from the phone case? It's a bit irritating.

933
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,480
Su-min, no, why did he take
out the photo of us together...

934
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,239
Ya-yan, did he take it out? Su-min: Yes.

935
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,649
Liyuan, you're too much.

936
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,090
Yayan, you also brought it out, huh?

937
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,426
Xiumin, no, Dongxu brother brought it out first, then I brought
it out. Yayan: Oh really? I was wondering why you brought it out.

938
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,749
Xiumin, no, if only I brought it
out, wouldn't it hurt my self-esteem?

939
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,559
Xiumin, no... I only brought it out after that
brother did. Why am I the only one who brought it out?

940
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,290
Ya Yan, that's right.

941
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,820
JaeJae, is Show Min always
this fast at speaking?

942
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,460
- Cute - That's what I'm saying.
JaeJae, is Show Min always
this fast at speaking?

943
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:14,900
- Cute - That's what I'm saying.

944
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:16,300
You Qing seems very angry.

945
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,316
Ya Yan, if it were me, I would react the same way. Show Min, did
you take it out yesterday because you had a date with your sister?

946
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,499
Li Yuan... hmm?

947
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,869
Ya Yan, wasn't it still there yesterday?
Li Yuan, I don't know. I'm not interested.

948
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,080
Xiumin took it out last night.

949
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,430
Ah, I really did.

950
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,180
Xiumin's heart is in turmoil.

951
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,659
Xiumin: Ha...

952
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,676
It seems like I have to let my hair down.

953
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,460
I need to let my hair
down to wear this hat.

954
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,760
I'm going to fight. Are you coming with me?

955
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,929
Xiumin: Is this the pain of love...?

956
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,669
Liyuan: This isn't love.
Xiumin: Then what is it...?

957
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,379
Liyuan: This is just a like.

958
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,380
Correct.

959
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,110
What is love?

960
00:52:56,111 --> 00:52:56,340
Xiumin: What is
love? Liyuan: Is it love?

961
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,340
Xiumin: Is it love? - Mm.
Xiumin: What is
love? Liyuan: Is it love?

962
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,840
Xiumin: What is
love? Liyuan: Is it love?

963
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,580
Yooli: This skilled person.
Liyuan: Can you die for that person?

964
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,456
Xiumin: Well, if it's just going on
a couple of dates, it seems possible.

965
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,020
Yooli: Ha...! Impressive.

966
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,020
At the same time.

967
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,749
Dongxu: I'm a bit worried...

968
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,290
Huicheng, ah, so torn...

969
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:19,530
Huicheng, but... to be honest, tuna
goes best with spicy beef instant noodles.

970
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,280
How delicious it must be.
Talked for a while and ate.

971
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,070
Huicheng, okay, let's
mix it up, mix it up first.

972
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,070
Huicheng, after coating each
strand of noodles with seasoning.

973
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,910
Huicheng, take a sniff of the aroma.

974
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,191
Junrong, what are they doing?
Are they transfer printing?

975
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,150
Huicheng Then... start with a
little less noodles for the first bite.

976
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:41,690
Do you want to have less?

977
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:46,690
Huicheng Then... blow
on it and start eating!

978
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,030
Spectators immersed in
the dazzling way of eating.

979
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,129
Dongxu Me... Let me have a bite...
Huicheng It looks delicious, right?

980
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,639
Dongxu Let me have a bite... Minjian
Bro, would you like to have a bite too?

981
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,270
Junrong Then let me try it...?

982
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,690
I want tuna.

983
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
What about you?

984
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,709
Chengyun, I... I want it too.

985
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,786
I'll also have a bite. Just a little bit.
Chengyun, I'll just have a little bit...

986
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,720
Huicheng, then have another
bite of tuna. Have a bite of tuna!

987
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,080
- It's delicious, right?
- There's tuna here.
Huicheng, then have another
bite of tuna. Have a bite of tuna!

988
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,386
- It's delicious, right?
- There's tuna here.

989
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,770
It's so delicious.

990
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,080
That's what I'm saying.

991
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,680
That's how it is.

992
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,050
Thank you.

993
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:29,900
Junrong has requested a
1:1 private conversation.

994
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,640
Who is the girl that Jun Rong is having
a secret one-on-one conversation with?

995
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,579
It's Zheng Lie. Ah~ I'm really excited.

996
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,690
Are you saying that Jun Rong initiated it?

997
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:41,180
Yes, it was Jun Rong who initiated it.
Are you saying that Jun Rong initiated it?

998
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,886
Yes, it was Jun Rong who initiated it.

999
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,610
Chuu, now it's Jun Rong's time.

1000
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,759
Oh? Hi.

1001
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,060
Jun Rong, hello. Xiu Min, hello.

1002
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,300
Jun Rong → Xiu Min

1003
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,840
Jun Rong, actually, I
don't know what to say...

1004
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,980
Xiumin, now we're having a secret
conversation, huh? Junrong, mhm.

1005
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,420
Junrong, what... are you thinking?

1006
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,720
Xiumin, today I have a lot of thoughts.

1007
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,260
Junrong, so you're
organizing your thoughts?

1008
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,710
There's nothing for young
boys and girls to talk about.

1009
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,180
Xiumin, why do I suddenly feel
like we've become so awkward?

1010
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,550
Junrong, yeah...

1011
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:03,790
Junrong, I'm just curious about your thoughts,
that's why I wanted to have a secret conversation.

1012
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,639
Jun Rong, I initially felt like we
became a little closer yesterday...

1013
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,440
Jun Rong, but as soon as I entered the resting room,
I felt the same way. You felt the same way too.

1014
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,610
It feels like we're back to square one.

1015
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:33,520
Jun Rong, do you... have anything to say?

1016
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,290
Xiu Min, I'm just curious about what you
thought after my brother left with me yesterday.

1017
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,970
Jun Rong, actually, I mentioned before

1018
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:52,870
Jun Rong, I have feelings for you, but because you get
along so well with each other, I decided to step back.

1019
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,549
Jun Rong, but we became
closer after our date.

1020
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:03,650
Jun Rong, so I expressed my
feelings and you accepted them.

1021
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,560
So it seems like I have more thoughts now.

1022
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,390
Jun Rong, what should I do...

1023
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,070
Xiu Min, actually, I feel
quite complicated right now...

1024
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,839
Still organizing my thoughts.

1025
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,440
Take your time to organize them.

1026
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,840
Jun Rong, just do what you think is best.

1027
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:35,980
What does "organize" mean that Xiumin said?

1028
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,460
Yayan, the weather is so nice today.

1029
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,430
Chengyun, but it's so hot. It
has been hot since this morning.

1030
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,730
Chengyun, where did they all go?

1031
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,570
Yayan, Xiumin, I really don't
understand. What am I doing?

1032
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,420
Yayan, it seems like he likes Huiren.

1033
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,620
Yayan, and it seems like
everyone else considers me a friend.

1034
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,030
Did he not come?

1035
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,730
Did Dongxu not come?

1036
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,570
Did he go to the dormitory?

1037
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,369
What's wrong? Are you feeling complicated?

1038
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:34,810
Your expression doesn't look too good. Are
you feeling mixed emotions? Are you tired?

1039
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,980
No, it's not.

1040
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,280
I'm a little tired of it.

1041
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,300
Yes, that's right.

1042
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,149
In the 1:1 secret conversation
room, there is Huiran.

1043
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,540
Why are you laughing and coming?

1044
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,780
Hui Ren ↔ Cheng Yun

1045
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,880
Day 4 Cheng Yun's Little Recording

1046
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,719
Naming for destiny tree value
0-10% enemies, 10-50% strangers

1047
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,690
50-80% ambiguous, 80-90%
love 90-100% destiny

1048
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,800
Cheng Yun sincerely
believes in naming for destiny

1049
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:38,170
Cheng Yun wrote to Hui Ren

1050
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,680
Hui Cheng, you should like cute girls.

1051
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,710
Chengyun: Um, it seems like it.

1052
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:48,049
Huicheng: Cute and kind.
Chengyun: That's right.

1053
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:51,449
Chengyun: What musical do you like? Are there
any you want to see? Do you watch them often?

1054
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,789
Chengyun: Because you said you are in the Musical
Theater program, I'm also studying musicals.

1055
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,290
Chengyun: So I'm quite curious.

1056
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,570
Chengyun erases "Play
soccer" from the wish list.

1057
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:11,810
Wrote 'take a walk with
friends of the opposite sex'

1058
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,386
Now it's just about getting closer

1059
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,490
Let's often go for a walk

1060
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,550
Okay
Let's often go for a walk

1061
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:20,780
Let's often go for a walk

1062
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,990
Chengyun realized his
wish list the next morning

1063
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,070
-Run -Now it's Huiren

1064
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:28,890
Now it seems to be Huiren

1065
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,860
Fourth night, girls' dormitory

1066
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,729
Yuli, Huiren, how was your day today?

1067
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:40,640
It was fun chatting with Chengyun

1068
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,140
Day 4: The Little Record of Huiren

1069
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,350
Wrote a big name of Chengyun

1070
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,950
Chengyun and Huiren's hearts are in sync

1071
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,536
Chengyun, do you feel shy when you
are alone with someone? Huiren: Yeah.

1072
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,220
Huiren: I don't know what to say.

1073
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,560
Chengyun: What should we say? I'm shy too.

1074
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,539
Chengyun: Ah! The seashell from
yesterday was beautiful, wasn't it?

1075
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:15,850
Hui Ren: Hmm, I put it in the room.

1076
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:16,850
Right?
Hui Ren: Hmm, I put it in the room.

1077
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:17,940
Hui Ren: Hmm, I put it in the room.

1078
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,580
Cheng Yun picked up
seashells at the seaside.

1079
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,320
Let's come back to see the sea next time.
Put them in the pocket.

1080
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,920
Washed the seashells with water.

1081
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,760
Sent them to Hui Ren.

1082
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,759
Cheng Yun: I brought them back.

1083
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,029
Hui Ren: I haven't been to the seaside yet.

1084
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,420
Cheng Yun: That's why I brought them back.
Didn't you say you wanted to go to the seaside?

1085
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,430
Hmm.
Cheng Yun: That's why I brought them back.
Didn't you say you wanted to go to the seaside?

1086
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:40,500
Hmm.

1087
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,159
JaeJae wow, he remembered everything.

1088
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,270
JaeJae Chengyun is so thoughtful.

1089
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:44,000
Impressive.
JaeJae Chengyun is so thoughtful.

1090
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,480
Impressive.

1091
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,109
Huirun is quite fun.
Chengyun, was it yesterday?

1092
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,009
Huirun went out and came back
not long after, about 2 hours?

1093
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,930
Chengyun, were you taking
photos the whole time?

1094
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,909
Huirun, it seems like we
only have 15 photos left.

1095
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:02,179
Chengyun, because there were many animals, we took a lot of
photos of animals. Huirun, what kind of animals were there?

1096
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,550
Chengyun, dairy cow

1097
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,740
Chengyun, did you know that
a cow's tongue is really long?

1098
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,140
Huiren, did you see its tongue? Chengyun, feed it like this.
- Feed it like this -Feed it

1099
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,190
Here
Huiren, did you see its tongue? Chengyun, feed it like this.
- Feed it like this -Feed it

1100
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,140
Here

1101
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,770
Dairy cow

1102
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:14,990
Huiren and Chengyun are happy
because of the animal topic

1103
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,770
Yinyin is also like this
Huiren and Chengyun are happy
because of the animal topic

1104
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:15,940
Huiren and Chengyun are happy
because of the animal topic

1105
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,190
Yinyin also really doesn't like it.
Huiren and Chengyun are happy
because of the animal topic

1106
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:18,330
Huiren and Chengyun are happy
because of the animal topic

1107
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,946
Chengyun... JaeJae sees Chengyun
smiling so brightly for the first time.

1108
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:25,139
He feels that Chengyun's face is all red.

1109
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,820
Chengyun is quite fun, right? Huirun: Hmm.

1110
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,830
Huirun wants to feed the children
(Tuantuan, Yunyun, and Dada).

1111
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,476
Chengyun: Is there food? I went for a walk this morning.
Huirun: Ah, is there? I haven't finished eating yet.

1112
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,080
-Watered them -If you don't say anything

1113
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,330
Hui Ren, if others also fed them without
saying anything, Would they grow so big?
-Watered them -If you don't say anything

1114
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:38,219
Hui Ren, if others also fed them without
saying anything, Would they grow so big?

1115
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,480
Cheng Yun, Tuan Tuan & Yun Yun?

1116
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,480
Yes
Cheng Yun, Tuan Tuan & Yun Yun?

1117
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:40,660
Cheng Yun, Tuan Tuan & Yun Yun?

1118
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,559
Zheng Lie, why are they holding
onto a tissue box? Together?

1119
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,669
Shang Xun, why are they
holding onto a tissue box? Hahaha

1120
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,146
- They want to hold hands, but they can't, right?
- Yes Zheng Lie, this is wanting to hold hands, but it's not allowed, right?

1121
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,720
Zheng Lie, that's why we're
holding onto the tissue box together.

1122
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,440
Oh, I see.
Zheng Lie, that's why we're
holding onto the tissue box together.

1123
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:53,450
Oh, I see.

1124
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:56,940
Cheng Yun, but I often go to
Tuan Tuan & Yun Yun's place.

1125
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:06,279
Hui Ren, I hope there will be new animals too.
Cheng Yun, me too. What do you want to have?

1126
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,949
Hui Ren, rabbits! Cheng Yun, rabbits.

1127
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,879
Hui Ren, goats. Cheng Yun, goats.

1128
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,899
Huirén, Alpaca. Chengyun, Alpaca?

1129
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,900
Um.

1130
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,490
Huirén, my goal today
is to not cause trouble.

1131
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:19,780
Really?

1132
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,159
Chengyun, I feel like I can't do it. Huirén,
no, if I give it my all, I can do it.

1133
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,560
Huirén, just don't take it lightly even once. Once you
let your guard down even a little, it will be too late.

1134
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,110
Last night.
Oh, what should I do?

1135
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,480
Chengyun used a tissue to
dip the dishwashing detergent.

1136
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,710
Taking care of Huiren.

1137
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,109
Chengyun: So what?

1138
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,960
Huiren: Just clean it up.
Chengyun: Just clean it up.

1139
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,080
- Hmm - Hmm
Huiren: Just clean it up.
Chengyun: Just clean it up.

1140
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:41,970
- Hmm - Hmm

1141
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,479
Let's clean up together.

1142
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,370
Just hand you the tissue from the side.

1143
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:58,970
Yayan applied for a
1:1 private conversation.

1144
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,940
Who is the young man
that Yajin is waiting for?

1145
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,779
Is it Chuu Hui Seong?

1146
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,300
Oh, is it Jeong Ryeol?
- Who is it, who is it? Is it Seong Yoon?

1147
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,929
Yajin, have you arrived? Haha

1148
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,800
Was the journey to here a
bit difficult for you, Yajin?

1149
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,200
The young man who went up to
the wooden house is Minjeon.

1150
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,770
Yajin → Minjeon

1151
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,269
Isn't it very nice-looking?

1152
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,290
Hmm.

1153
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,279
How is it here, Yayan? Minjian: It's
pretty good. Everyone is very kind.

1154
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:45,530
Minjian: But it's strange, I thought everything would go smoothly after coming
here. But I can't make music. I haven't been able to create anything so far.

1155
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:46,550
But it's strange.
Minjian: But it's strange, I thought everything would go smoothly after coming
here. But I can't make music. I haven't been able to create anything so far.

1156
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,730
Minjian: But it's strange, I thought everything would go smoothly after coming
here. But I can't make music. I haven't been able to create anything so far.

1157
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,166
- Really?
- I haven't been able to create anything so far.
Minjian: But it's strange, I thought everything would go smoothly after coming
here. But I can't make music. I haven't been able to create anything so far.

1158
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:50,190
Minjian: But it's strange, I thought everything would go smoothly after coming
here. But I can't make music. I haven't been able to create anything so far.

1159
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:54,090
Yayan: Is it because you have too many
ideas? Minjian: My mind is too complicated.

1160
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,329
Because of this mindset,
I couldn't make music.

1161
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:01,549
What aspect of complexity does
Yayan refer to? Minjian: Everything.

1162
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,330
Everything.

1163
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,670
Yayan really doesn't understand what boys are
thinking and doesn't know what you guys are thinking.

1164
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,710
Yayan, so I'm really telling the truth.

1165
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,240
Starting from yesterday, it's been
reset, so it's even more chaotic.

1166
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:20,920
Yayan, I want to completely open up my heart
and understand one by one. Minjian: Me too.

1167
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,190
Chengyun: Oh? What is that?

1168
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,860
Chengyun and Huiren have
come out to the sports field.

1169
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,460
Yayan: Can't you see us?

1170
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,960
Minjian: Hello

1171
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,170
What's going on?
Huiren: Oh? What's going on?

1172
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,950
Girls' Dormitory

1173
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,180
Liyuan is getting ready.

1174
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:10,200
Liyuan has requested a
1:1 private conversation.

1175
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:25,680
Liyuan: The friend I originally liked was Huicheng.
I want to accurately understand Huicheng's feelings.

1176
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,380
Of course, choose Hui Cheng. Hui Cheng

1177
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,620

Li Yuan -> Hui Cheng

1179
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,020
Checking appearance for the
last time before Hui Cheng arrives.

1180
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,770
The air conditioner
temperature must be lowered.

1181
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,670
Affectionate, because Hui Cheng is very sensitive to heat.
- Because Hui Cheng is very sensitive to heat - Because he sweats a lot.

1182
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,710
Oh my.
Affectionate, because Hui Cheng is very sensitive to heat.

01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,340
So shy

1193
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,810
Huicheng Hello Li Yuan Hi

Huicheng Do we need to have a
conversation now? Li Yuan Yes, it seems so

What do you want to chat about?

1198
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,920
What does Huicheng want to
say? Liyuan: I don't know either.

1199
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,970
Huicheng: Did you have fun with
Dongxu yesterday? Liyuan: Hmm.

1200
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,140

Liyuan: We had shaved ice...

1204
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:47,780
Liyuan took a photo and went to
school. Huicheng, is it the school?

01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,130
Took a photo and went to school.

- What? - I don't know either.

1211
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,846
Liyuan: Ah, I dare not look
directly at your face. Huicheng: Why?

1212
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,440
Liyuan: I'm very shy.

1213
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:08,780
Liyuan, your face is too
close, I dare not look.

1214
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:11,290
Liyuan, I only wrote about you
in my diary. Huicheng, really?

01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,690
Huicheng, why? Liyuan, no reason...

1220
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,790
Liyuan's diary.

1221
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:24,130
Huicheng, can I visit your main

01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,709
Today's classic scene S#1: Huicheng
said he wants to see me practice my major!

1226
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:37,216
You look better with your forehead exposed! Haha Today, my favorite opposite-sex
friend Liang Huicheng wore glasses today! And styled his hair with bangs!

1227
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,756
- You look better with your forehead exposed.
- You look better with your forehead exposed. You look better with your forehead exposed ~~

1228
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,110
What should I do?

1229
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:42,930
Today I went to the beach with Huicheng It's the most
beautiful sea I've ever seen in my life. I'm so happy!

1230
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:44,890

in the sea that I've seen

beautiful sea I've ever seen in my life. I'm so happy!

1236
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:03,929
Huicheng took Tuantuan and Yunyun
out for a walk in the morning before

1237
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:07,740
Huicheng is very cute Li Yuan, I've
never taken them for a walk before

1238
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:11,526
Huicheng: This is also the first time I took them
for a walk today. Li Yuan: Oh, really? Alone?

1239
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:13,630
Li Yuan: Are you alone?
Huicheng: No, with Chengyun.

1240
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:19,419
Li Yuan: What time did you wake up? Huicheng:
It seems like 9 o'clock... around 27 minutes?

1241
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,419
Li Yuan: I envy you. You can wake up later. Huicheng:
I heard that you seem to wake up the earliest.

1242
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,889
Li Yuan: Yeah, today I think I only
slept for 3 hours? Or was it 2 hours?

1243
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:32,889
Huicheng and Junrong are completely opposite.
He goes to bed early and gets up late.

1244
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,500
Liyuan, by the way, Junrong
and I are the same age.

1245
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,760
Huicheng: Huh? We? I am not.

1246
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,710
Liyuan: I always thought
you were the same age.

1247
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,710
Liyuan: Feels like a
brother. Huicheng: Is that so?

1248
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:49,180
Huicheng: Is there anywhere else
you want to go besides the beach?

1249
01:09:49,181 --> 01:09:50,200
Me? -Mm.

1250
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,069
I want to take a walk with you tonight.

1251
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:53,296
- Want to take a walk tonight? - Yes.

1252
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,406
- Wow! - Oh, that's great.
Affectionate. Oh, that's great~

1253
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,986
- I want to take a walk with you tonight.
- That's wonderful.

1254
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:59,836
I want to take a walk with you tonight.
Chuu, can't even look into your eyes.

1255
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,009
I want to take a walk with you tonight~

1256
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:03,360
I want to take a walk with you tonight.

1257
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:06,390
Liyuan: I see everyone else taking
walks in the evening. Huicheng: Really?

1258
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:11,110
Liyuan: Well... I was going to
say it, but you went into the room.

1259
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,680
Huicheng: I thought the
weather was too hot...

1260
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,679
Liyuan: So I waited until it
got dark. Huicheng: Oh, really?

1261
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,619
Liyuan: I wouldn't ask you to
go for a walk during the day.

1262
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,250
Huicheng: That's why I didn't know.

1263
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,920
Liyuan, I saw you go
straight back to your room.

1264
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:32,159
Liyuan, I see that you don't play the piano alone. You either play
the drums with Dongxu, and I don't have a chance to talk to you.

1265
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,229
Liyuan, you don't have any alone time.

1266
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,870
Huicheng, it's because I've become too familiar
with the boys. Liyuan, yes, we're the same.

1267
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:44,940
Liyuan, but it feels like it's not a coincidence,
but rather inevitable. I really like everyone.

1268
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,149
Also like you

1269
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,150
Hmm

1270
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,440
- Hmm - Hmm Huicheng, hmm...

1271
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,579
Chuu Eh! Huicheng hesitated
after hearing "also like you"

1272
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:54,630
Chuu Hearing her say "also like you"~

1273
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,670
- Why, why - Huicheng, why
Chuu Hearing her say "also like you"~

1274
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,880
Chuu Hearing her say "also like you"~

1275
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,415
JaeJae, what comes after "hmm"?

1276
01:10:58,416 --> 01:10:59,760
Is this where it ends?

1277
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,660
Can't think of anything to say

1278
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:12,870
Liyuan speaks in a stuttering manner. In front of
the person I like, I dare not make eye contact.

1279
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:20,580
Liyuan is too shy, she can't
even speak... it's like that.

1280
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,270
Huicheng, sister, what kind of person do you
like? What do you think? What is your ideal type?

1281
01:11:26,271 --> 01:11:27,450
- What is your ideal type? - What?

1282
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,170
JaeJae, isn't this a
rhetorical question, Huicheng?
- What is your ideal type? - What?

1283
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:29,979
JaeJae, isn't this a
rhetorical question, Huicheng?

1284
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,150
Zheng Lie, you idiot, is that you~

1285
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:31,590
It's you.
Zheng Lie, you idiot, is that you~

1286
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,150
It's you.

1287
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:33,990
Li Yuan, ideal type? To be honest?

1288
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,090
Ideal type? - Hmm.
Li Yuan, ideal type? To be honest?

1289
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:35,410
Li Yuan, ideal type? To be honest?

1290
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,230
- To be honest? - Hmm.
Li Yuan, ideal type? To be honest?

1291
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:37,260
Li Yuan, ideal type? To be honest?

1292
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:42,299
Li Yuan is similar to you.
Hui Cheng, like me? In what way?

1293
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,000
Hui Cheng, for example? Li
Yuan, someone who looks very manly.

1294
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,740
Hui Cheng, do I look
very manly? Li Yuan, yes.

1295
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,950
- Is that so? - Hmm.

1296
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:55,879
Liyuan: Everyone is so beautiful. Huicheng: Is
being handsome about having a masculine look?

1297
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,110
Liyuan: Absolutely not.
Huicheng: Ah, so I'm not handsome?

1298
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:59,630
- Ah, no... - I understand.

1299
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:02,580
Liyuan: Ah, no, no, no, it's
not like that. You are handsome.

1300
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,040
Liyuan: You are especially
handsome. Huicheng: No, no.

1301
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:09,320
Liyuan, I often tell others
that you are the most handsome.

1302
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,199
Liyuan, really, so
others say it's not true.

1303
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,129
Liyuan, ah, it's true. I always tell others that
you are the most handsome. Huicheng: Thank you.

1304
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:21,600
Liyuan, so others say our
tastes are really different.

1305
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:24,910
Huicheng: They are
different, ah. Liyuan: Yes.

1306
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:32,380
Liyuan: Have you been in a relationship?
Huicheng: Um, I have been in a relationship.

1307
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:35,280
Huicheng, about two or three times?

1308
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,490
Huicheng, but none of them lasted
very long. Liyuan: Ah, really?

1309
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,530
Hmm.

1310
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:46,030
Liyuan: Can I ask how many days you lasted?
Huicheng: The longest was over 50 days.

1311
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:48,180
Liyuan: It seems like you
haven't truly loved before.

1312
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,560
- What?
- Then you probably haven't truly loved.
Liyuan: It seems like you
haven't truly loved before.

1313
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:49,806
- What?
- Then you probably haven't truly loved.

1314
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:54,730
It's true, I haven't loved. It seems like I haven't truly
loved before. It seems like I haven't truly loved before~

1315
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,210
Zheng Lie Wow...

1316
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:57,840
How should we deal with them?

1317
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:03,840
Hui Cheng, do you love? I don't
really understand the exact definition.

1318
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,650
That's right, that's right. You definitely don't
understand either, because I don't understand either.

1319
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,290
Hui Cheng, what do you want
to say... Li Yuan, just say it.

1320
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,889
Hui Cheng, actually the content
of the conversation is not much.

1321
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:26,890
Hui Cheng, because she is more introverted than I imagined.
Her personality seems to be the opposite of mine, Li Yuan sis.

1322
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,210
Liyuan, I'll help you fold a rose.

1323
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:34,580
Liyuan, is it like this? I
can't remember how to do it.

1324
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,780
Huicheng, after folding it
all, Liyuan, right? Can you do it?

1325
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,880
Huicheng, I seem to have seen it before. Liyuan,
how do you do it? I suddenly can't remember.

1326
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:43,110
How do you do it?

1327
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,920
Liyuan, so do you have someone
of the opposite sex that you like?

1328
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,970
Hmm.

1329
01:13:49,971 --> 01:13:53,430
Hui Cheng, me? I still haven't...

1330
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:59,900
Still not sure who I'm attracted to.

1331
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,486
Hui Cheng, because everyone is
still watching from the sidelines.

1332
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:07,270
Li Yuan, it's too short a time.
That's right.

1333
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,480
Failed.

1334
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:27,460
Li Yuan, why can't I speak in front of him?

1335
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,600
Li Yuan, what does he like? What
kind of expression does he like?

1336
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:36,470
Dong Xu, hmm? Li Yuan, does he
like aloof people or gentle people?

1337
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,410
Dongxu, is Huicheng okay? Liyuan: Hmm.

1338
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,579
Dongxu, I don't know.

1339
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,440
Liyuan, how is he when he's with the boys?

1340
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:46,380
Dongxu: He is really well-behaved.

1341
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:53,390
Dongxu: He may be big in size,
but his personality is like this...

1342
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,779
Liyuan: He doesn't look like it at all.

1343
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,220
And when I am with her,
we take pictures like this.

1344
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:57,890
Liyuan: And when I am with Huiren, we take
pictures like this. Dongxu: That's his charm.
And when I am with her,
we take pictures like this.

1345
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,830
Liyuan: And when I am with Huiren, we take
pictures like this. Dongxu: That's his charm.

1346
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,629
What is Luyuan?

1347
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,060
What time is it, Luyuan?
It's time to go practice.

1348
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,469
Luyuan, I'm leaving.
Xiumin, what should I do?

1349
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:07,739
Luyuan, stay here. Xiumin, why?

1350
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,200
Luyuan, stay with your brother.

1351
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,186
Dongxu, are you going to leave
me behind and go by yourself?

1352
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,880
Xiumin, can't I go?

1353
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,250
Dongxu, don't go.

1354
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,960
Alright.

1355
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,220
Chuu, oh my, oh my, oh my, what's going on with walking
backwards~ Walking backwards, walking backwards.

1356
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:36,230
Is this playing in reverse?
Chuu, oh my, oh my, oh my, what's going on with walking
backwards~ Walking backwards, walking backwards.

1357
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:37,510
Is this playing in reverse?

1358
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,500
Dongxu, why are you walking over like this?

1359
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,200
Suimin, eat quickly.

1360
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:45,939
Dongxu, do you want to
throw it away? Suimin: Hmm.

1361
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,516
Dongxu, give it to me. Suimin:
Is it something I've eaten before?

1362
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,140
Dong Xu, it's okay.

1363
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,310
Ya Yan, where do you want to go?

1364
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,400
Where do you want to go?

1365
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,349
Ya Yan, where do you want to go? Hui Cheng,
it feels like we're going the same way, right?

1366
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:32,049
Ya Yan, really? Where do you want to go?
Hui Cheng, let's just keep going and see.

1367
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,420
Ya Yan, okay.

1368
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,850
Hui Cheng, indeed, we
are going the same way.

1369
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,630
Ya Yan, what's going on?

1370
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:41,500
1:1 Secret Chat Room.

1371
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:47,870
Huicheng, wait a second.

1372
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,440
What's going on!
Is it Huicheng?

1373
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,040
Love, Huicheng and Yayan?

1374
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,609
Yayan, this place is beautifully decorated.

1375
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:58,810
Yayan, are you feeling
hot? Huicheng: Um, here...

1376
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,760
Huicheng: It's that place...
Yayan: Which place? Hahaha.

1377
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:02,180
-Dialogue-Is it that place?

1378
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,210
Huicheng: It's the secret
conversation room... Yayan: OK.
-Dialogue-Is it that place?

1379
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,620
Huicheng: It's the secret
conversation room... Yayan: OK.

1380
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,290
Huicheng is my application to you.

1381
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,530
Huicheng-Yayen

1382
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:15,330
Yayen: Mhm. Huicheng: Ah, but...

1383
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,400
Huicheng: Let me wipe off my sweat real
quick. Yayen: Go ahead and wipe it, haha.

1384
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:19,630
Mhm.
Huicheng: Let me wipe off my sweat real
quick. Yayen: Go ahead and wipe it, haha.

1385
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:20,140
Mhm.

1386
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:22,199
Yayen: I'm fine. Huicheng:
Every time I meet you,

1387
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,769
Huicheng: I always feel hot.
Yayen: What's wrong? Are you nervous?

1388
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,679
Hui Cheng: Ai~~~Yo, how
is it possible for me?

1389
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,379
Ya Yan: Ah? Isn't it?
Hui Cheng: Am I nervous?

1390
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,550
Ya Yan: Tsk, got it. Hui Cheng: Me? Me?

1391
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,879
Ya Yan: 17 degrees? Hui Cheng:
Now I'm leisurely chewing gum.

1392
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,490
Hui Cheng: Can you see
it? Ya Yan: OK, received.

1393
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:42,385
Hui Cheng: Did we have fun
yesterday? Ya Yan: Fun? Um...

1394
01:17:42,386 --> 01:17:44,949
Yayan, when I see cows,
I really like animals.

1395
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:46,920
Mmm.

1396
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,129
Huicheng rode a bicycle
yesterday. Yayan must have sweated.

1397
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:54,369
Huicheng did sweat. The wind was cool
at that time. Yayan Oh, that's great.

1398
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:58,409
Huicheng rode a bicycle the day before
yesterday, yesterday, and today too?

1399
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,609
Yayan, how about it? Are you going to ride
bicycles with me today? Huicheng: Hmm, really?

1400
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,909
Youqing: No, I feel like
Huicheng might like Yayan.

1401
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:05,910
That's right.

1402
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,849
JaeJae: Huicheng has fallen
for Yayan, no doubt about it.

1403
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,170
JaeJae: It all started with ballet lessons.
That's right...

1404
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,489
Huicheng: Have you adapted to it yet?
Yayan: Me? Because everyone is very nice.

1405
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,650
Yayan adapted much faster than expected.
Hyungseong, do you feel good about it?

1406
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:24,430
Hyungseong, coming here often
heals me. Yayan: Yes, that's right.

1407
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,639
Hyungseong had a lot of worries originally.

1408
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,470
Coming here has relieved many of them.

1409
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,380
Yayan: Yes, for us, it's a rest.

1410
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:40,109
Hyungseong, is there anything that makes you
feel tired coming here? Yayan: Me? As for me...

1411
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:45,150
Yayan: Everyone has
someone they clearly like.

1412
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,925
I can't easily get close, it feels...

1413
01:18:47,926 --> 01:18:49,559
Can't easily get close.

1414
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,459
Yayan: I can't join in... Huicheng: Does it feel
like everyone has already made their decisions?

1415
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,959
Yayan: Yeah, I already know everything.

1416
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:02,069
Yayan: It feels like it's not a place I should
participate in, so I can't easily get close.

1417
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,510
Yayan, have you made a decision?

1418
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:07,010
Huicheng, I am open-minded.

1419
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,250
Yayan, I am someone who feels curious?

1420
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:13,060
But it reset again starting from yesterday.

1421
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:13,220
It reset again starting from yesterday.

1422
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,980
- Starting from scratch? - Yeah.
It reset again starting from yesterday.

1423
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,480
It reset again starting from yesterday.

1424
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,219
JaeJae keeps talking about resetting.

1425
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:17,920
Very good, very good.

1426
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,400
Zhenglie, very good. Well done.
- That's how it should be done. - Well done.
Very good, very good.

1427
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,776
Zhenglie, very good. Well done.
- That's how it should be done. - Well done.

1428
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,220
All

1429
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:28,759
Yayan, you've probably seen me
in every possible way the most.

1430
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,469
Yayan, you've even seen me without makeup.
Huicheng: Yeah, I feel like I've seen that a lot.

1431
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:33,230
Huicheng: I see it quite often.

1432
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,740
Yayan, personal practice.

1433
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:42,110
During Yayan's practice
time, Huicheng is also there.

1434
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,979
Huicheng: Just one.
Just one. Yayan: Just one?

1435
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,310
Huicheng: I can do it now too.

1436
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,975
Huicheng, this, this Yayan, oh oh

1437
01:19:48,976 --> 01:19:50,250
This, this, is it like this?

1438
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:50,400
Youli, really amazing,
huh? Yayan, very soft
This, this, is it like this?

1439
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,010
Youli, really amazing,
huh? Yayan, very soft

1440
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,960
Yayan, it hurts more when
pressed down Huicheng, ah ah...

1441
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,230
The next day, Huicheng practices alone

1442
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,350
Shao Shao Restroom

1443
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:27,089
Huicheng, why... why are you
here again? Yayan, you can come in

1444
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,260
Yayan, today I'm going bare-faced, sorry.

1445
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,389
Huicheng, I often see (you) without
makeup. Yayan, why are you laughing?

1446
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:35,559
Huicheng, no, no. Yayan, I'm
imagining and laughing in my mind.

1447
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,170
Yayan, I definitely won't let you
see now. Huicheng, I will keep trying.

1448
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,439
Yayan, I absolutely won't let
you see. I'm going to lock the door.

1449
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,160
Huicheng, I'm going to break down the door.

1450
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,616
I feel like it's going to crash and break.

1451
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,939
Yayan, wow, if I stayed in the house, it must
suddenly be scary. Huicheng, boom boom boom.

1452
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:53,349
Huicheng suddenly extends his fist,
shaking his hand to greet here, hello.

1453
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,350
Hello.

1454
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,150
Yayan, open it.

1455
01:20:56,780 --> 01:21:00,189
Huicheng, is there anything
you want to do? Yayan, me? I...

1456
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,490
Yayan, I want to go to the
coffee shop. Huicheng, where?

1457
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,285
Yayan came over by bus for the filming of "Twenty-five
and Twenty-one"... Huicheng Ah, where is it?

1458
01:21:08,286 --> 01:21:09,870
It's right over there.

1459
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,129
Huicheng I often stay in
the dormitory. Yayan Me too.

1460
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:16,870
Yayan Friends will go out.

1461
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:22,079
Huicheng You wouldn't easily
approach on your own, would you?

1462
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,256
Huicheng What are you going to do? What are you going to do? I'm not
good at talking about these things. Yayan I'm really not good at it.

1463
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,919
Huicheng, but when others talk, they
will accept your personality. Yayan, me?

1464
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:36,189
Yayan, that's just how I am. I have to think
a hundred times before I say a sentence.

1465
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:39,629
Huicheng, do you have a lot of worries when
you speak? Yayan, I would say I have worries.

1466
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:43,000
Yayan, don't you feel that way?
Huicheng, no, I feel it's right.

1467
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:47,000
Huicheng, you have a strong
sense of responsibility, right?

1468
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,180
Hmm, yes, there is.

1469
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,960
Huicheng, I feel like she's suitable to be the
older sister at home. Yayan, is she suitable too?

1470
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,040
Both at my grandparents' house and my grandparents' house,
I am the oldest. Both Huicheng and Yayan are the oldest.
Huicheng, I feel like she's suitable to be the
older sister at home. Yayan, is she suitable too?

1471
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,436
Both at my grandparents' house and my grandparents' house,
I am the oldest. Both Huicheng and Yayan are the oldest.

1472
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,580
- Are you also? - Yes, I am.

1473
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:55,310
That's why it's like that, right?

1474
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:55,530
Yayan, I really feel like she's very good at
taking care of younger siblings. Huicheng, is she?
That's why it's like that, right?

1475
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,886
Yayan, I really feel like she's very good at
taking care of younger siblings. Huicheng, is she?

1476
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:59,810
Yayan is very reliable.

1477
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:02,130
Huicheng, it's just a habit for you to do ballet
moves effortlessly. When you say reliable,

1478
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,460
Are you talking about me?
Huicheng, it's just a habit for you to do ballet
moves effortlessly. When you say reliable,

1479
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,790
Huicheng, it's just a habit for you to do ballet
moves effortlessly. When you say reliable,

1480
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,320
Yayan, really? I was just casually...

1481
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:08,819
Huicheng, the posture is coming up
immediately. Yayan, no, it's not like that.

1482
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,706
Huicheng, do you want to lift your elbow like
this? Is it right? Yayan, Yes, that's right.

1483
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:11,950
Huicheng and Yayan
remember a day's schedule

1484
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:13,130
You still remember?
Huicheng and Yayan
remember a day's schedule

1485
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:15,030
Huicheng and Yayan
remember a day's schedule

1486
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,669
Yayan, I wish I could grow
taller Huicheng, 163 cm?

1487
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,970
Yayan, um, oh, still remember?

1488
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,469
Huicheng, do you eat seafood?
Yayan, I absolutely love it

1489
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:27,309
Huicheng, is there anything
you don't eat? Yayan, no

1490
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,090
No, right?

1491
01:22:28,091 --> 01:22:30,890
Yayan, do you like eggplants and
pumpkins? Huicheng, hmm~ Great memory, huh?

1492
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:31,900
Still remember.
Yayan, do you like eggplants and
pumpkins? Huicheng, hmm~ Great memory, huh?

1493
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:32,150
Yayan, do you like eggplants and
pumpkins? Huicheng, hmm~ Great memory, huh?

1494
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,380
Huicheng, a clever girl, a clever girl.

1495
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:41,559
Huicheng feels very comfortable
with Yayan, chatting feels natural too.

1496
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,360
- What do we talk about? Being with you - Yeah.
Huicheng, we talk about everything. Yayan, Yeah.

1497
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,859
Yayan is really funny.
Huicheng, It's been a few minutes.

1498
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,999
Huicheng, it's been about 30
minutes, right? Yayan, Really?

1499
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,830
Yayan, time really flies.

1500
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,010
Time really flies?

1501
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,650
- Time really flies. - Time really flies.
Time really flies?

1502
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:54,090
Time really flies?

1503
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:54,130
Oh my.
Time really flies?

1504
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:54,890
Oh my.

1505
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,940
There is something, oh, that's really...

1506
01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:02,109
Yayan, we get along well
and have a lot in common.

1507
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:06,309
Yayan, there are many interesting topics to
talk about. The conversation has never stopped.

1508
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:10,449
Yayan, later I looked at the time and didn't
realize that so much time had already passed.

1509
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,319
Huicheng: It's starting to get windy
now. Yayan: Yeah, a gentle breeze.

1510
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,159
Huicheng: I wish the wind would keep blowing
like this. Yayan: That's what I'm saying.

1511
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,429
Huicheng: The scenery. Yayan:
It's as beautiful as a painting.

1512
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,260
Huicheng: It's like
something out of a movie.

1513
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Yayan: Really?

1514
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:27,670
Huicheng: It feels like
being in a movie scene.

1515
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,069
Liyuan: Let's go and see
what Huicheng is doing.

1516
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,140
Liyuan, knock on the door, please.

1517
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,810
Liyuan, the lights are turned off, huh?

1518
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:41,150
Is there no one inside?

1519
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,690
Liyuan, let's go to my sister's studio.

1520
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,020
Liyuan, ouch!

1521
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,639
Liyuan, it really is, ouch. Xiumin: Hmm.

1522
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,330
Is that so?

1523
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,020
- No, it's the other way around.

1524
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:00,040
1:1 secret conversation room.

1525
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,110
Can't do it together
1:1 secret conversation room.

1526
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,330
1:1 secret conversation room.

1527
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:03,370
Is that so?
1:1 secret conversation room.

1528
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:03,520
Is that so?

1529
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,870
Liyuan and Xiumin walked over

1530
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:09,970
Oh my god, oh my god

1531
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,580
You don't know this, do you?

1532
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,930
Come and ask why like this

1533
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,090
Open it

1534
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:22,060
Liyuan, ah, is it Hui Cheng?
It sounds like Hui Cheng?

1535
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:23,790
No, no

1536
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:24,910
Zhenglie, that's the
secret chat room, isn't it?

1537
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:25,930
That's not considered a
secret conversation room anymore
Zhenglie, that's the
secret chat room, isn't it?

1538
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:25,956
That's not considered a
secret conversation room anymore

1539
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,300
- You have to protect secrets - You can't

1540
01:24:27,301 --> 01:24:29,960
How could JaeJae not
have good soundproofing?

1541
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,640
It's like it's about to shatter

1542
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,939
Ah, Liyeon, is that Huicheng? It
sounds like Huicheng's voice, huh?

1543
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,180
Xiumin, is it Yayin unnie?
Liyeon, yeah, he's with Yayin

1544
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,690
- All along - Isn't it?
It was accidentally missed

1545
01:24:41,691 --> 01:24:42,830
Liyuan, Hui Cheng is here.

1546
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:43,040
- Is it true?
- I fell down during practice yesterday.
Liyuan, Hui Cheng is here.

1547
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,556
- Is it true?
- I fell down during practice yesterday.

1548
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,150
Xiumin, ah, they seem to be chatting.

1549
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,000
Such a person.

1550
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,849
Liyuan accidentally heard
the sound from the secret room.

1551
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:56,189
Liyuan laughed loudly, hahaha.

1552
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:58,030
Liyuan was having a
very happy conversation...

1553
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:03,200
So, I... was quite jealous.

1554
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,230
What to do with this love...

1555
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:07,500
What to do, JaeJae...

1556
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:13,810
How can Liyuan be like that?
I'm no longer moved by it.

1557
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,780
Liyuan, it's over.

1558
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:20,609
Yayan likes to listen to music and look out of the window
while sitting in the car. Huicheng: Hmm, is that so?

1559
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:24,119
Huicheng: I often lose my
earphones, so I don't wear them much.

1560
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,320
Huicheng: When I listen to
songs, I'm alone on the bus.

1561
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,759
Yayan, being alone like this Huicheng:
Yeah, really, that's how it sounds

1562
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,290
Yayan: Quite cute, haha
Huicheng: Yeah, like this

1563
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,150
Yayan: Really interesting Huicheng:
The conversation has never stopped

1564
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:36,560
That's true
Yayan: Really interesting Huicheng:
The conversation has never stopped

1565
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,150
That's true

1566
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:42,370
Liyuan: I'm really stupid,
Xiumin Xiumin: No, older sister

1567
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:47,609
Liyuan: Liang Huicheng talks
non-stop with other girls

1568
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:50,340
Liyuan, you don't want
to talk to me, right?

1569
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,579
Xiumin seems to have finished
chatting with Yayan. Liyuan, really?

1570
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,049
Liyuan, but where is Huicheng?

1571
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,120
Liyuan, disappeared together with Yayan.

1572
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:02,390
Liyuan, seriously, I really...

1573
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,190
Liyuan, why am I spinning
in circles because of him?

1574
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:12,570
Huicheng, I didn't expect to chat here
for an hour. Yayan, wow, time flies, right?

1575
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,600
Did you talk for an hour? - For an hour?
For an hour?

1576
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,140
JaeJae, oh my goodness, didn't
you even drink a sip of water?

1577
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,550
Yayan, it's so hot outside. Huicheng,
hmm, let's quickly go inside the house.

1578
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,480
Yayan, what are the kids doing?

1579
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:32,550
Huicheng, who is coming from
over there? Yayan, everyone is here.

1580
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,489
Dongxu, oh, it's Huicheng.

1581
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,990
Liyuan, did I see you?

1582
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,070
Hello.

1583
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:39,870
Yayan, are you going to
the base? Liyuan: Mm-hmm.

1584
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:41,026
- Where are you going?
- Are you going to the base?
Yayan, are you going to
the base? Liyuan: Mm-hmm.

1585
01:26:41,026 --> 01:26:41,050
Yayan, are you going to
the base? Liyuan: Mm-hmm.

1586
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,410
- Mm-hmm. - Where did you guys go?
Yayan, are you going to
the base? Liyuan: Mm-hmm.

1587
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:42,630
Yayan, are you going to
the base? Liyuan: Mm-hmm.

1588
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,256
Huicheng, can I go? Can I follow
along? Yayan: That's what I'm saying.

1589
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,460
- Shouldn't you follow along?
- That's what I'm saying.

1590
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:54,370
Yayan: That's what I'm
saying. Dongxu: I know.

1591
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,410
Yayan, I also feel that
we cannot dwell on the past.

1592
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,550
Huicheng, let's go back and take a rest.

1593
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,220
Where does Huicheng need to rest?

1594
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:10,389
Huicheng, Lijuan's expression at
that time didn't look very good.

1595
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,289
At that moment, I was very conflicted.

1596
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:15,730
Where should I go?

1597
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,760
At that time, really...

1598
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:21,600
Feeling a bit panicked...

1599
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:28,139
Xiumin, why are those two
together? Lijuan, let's chat.

1600
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,980
Xiumin, didn't we just chat a moment ago? Li Yuan:
Maybe we had a really enjoyable conversation.

1601
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:34,549
Xiumin, are you angry?
Li Yuan: No, I'm not.

1602
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:35,919
Xiumin, are you jealous?
Li Yuan: No, I'm not.

1603
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,419
Xiumin, are you lying about not being jealous?
Li Yuan: No, I'm not. I really am not.

1604
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,460
Li Yuan: I'm just upset that
he is indifferent towards me.

1605
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:51,000
Liyuan: I'm not jealous, just
angry that he is indifferent to me.

1606
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:53,400
Liyuan: So I also plan to be indifferent.

1607
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:54,470
Understood.

1608
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,300
Xiumin: She is angry
because of his indifference.

1609
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,610
Liyuan: Is it fun? Yayan: Me?

1610
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:14,690
Liyuan came over and held her hand.

1611
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:20,230
Liyuan: Is it fun? Yayan: Me?

1612
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,729
Yayan: Mmm.

1613
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,459
Liyuan: I envy you guys.
You get along so well.

1614
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,570
Liyuan: I can't even look him in the eye.

1615
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,439
Youqing: She said she envies
how well they get along.

1616
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,280
Youqing: Wow, how did the kids come
up with such words? They're amazing.

1617
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,330
Really, recently...
Youqing: Wow, how did the kids come
up with such words? They're amazing.

1618
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,740
Youqing: Wow, how did the kids come
up with such words? They're amazing.

1619
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,850
JaeJae: Learning how to love from the kids.

1620
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,130
So cool.
JaeJae: Learning how to love from the kids.

1621
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:35,310
JaeJae: Learning how to love from the kids.

1622
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,179
Liyuan, let's go to the
swimming pool, Huicheng.

1623
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,319
Huicheng, I'm pondering.

1624
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,460
Yayan, I want to go swimming.
Huicheng, then let's go swimming.

1625
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,720
From there on, my mood became very bad.

1626
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,560
Huicheng and Yayan are
having a great time playing.

1627
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:55,700
Let go.

1628
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,769
Always avoiding me and
taking care of Yayan.

1629
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:01,739
It makes me very jealous.

1630
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,169
Huicheng toilet paper...

1631
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,769
Liyuan, let me go get it. Yayan,
there's no need, no need, no need.

1632
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:06,309
I also want to go.
- Let me go get it. - I also want to go.

1633
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:08,910
Liyuan could only watch them from afar.

1634
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,680
I feel so sad...

1635
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:10,990
With my best friend and the boy I like.

1636
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:12,580
She is my closest friend.
With my best friend and the boy I like.

1637
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:12,770
With my best friend and the boy I like.

1638
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,600
Huicheng also knows how I feel.
With my best friend and the boy I like.

1639
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:14,850
With my best friend and the boy I like.

1640
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,820
There is a feeling of being abandoned.

1641
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,760
Extremely sad.

1642
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,460
Is it because of love, Xiumin?

1643
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,760
Yes, it is love.

1644
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,860
I want to listen together with you.

1645
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,299
Dongxu, I will come over.

1646
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,300
Why are you alone here?

1647
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:35,869
Junrong, I also want to
go out. Xiumin: Go out then.

1648
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,150
Are you willing to accompany me?

1649
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,509
It has become awkward with Dongxu.

1650
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,190
A feeling of distance in the relationship?

1651
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:52,089
What's wrong, Junrong? What's
wrong? Shumin: It's just, it's just...

1652
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,010
Junrong: Is it because
I didn't bring you along?
