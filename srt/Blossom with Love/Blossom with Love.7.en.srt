7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,040
Yayan: What are the kids doing?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,479
Huicheng: Who is coming from
over there? Yayan: Everyone is here.

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,040
Liyuan, did you see it, okay?

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,180
Hello.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,799
Yayan, do you want to go to the base?
Where do you want to go?

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,160
Liyuan, hmm.
Where did you guys go?

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,959
Huicheng, can I go? Can I follow
along? Yayan, that's what I'm saying.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,079
Dongxu, maybe I shouldn't go with them?

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,679
Yayan, that's what I'm saying...
It's better to come over here.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,839
Dongxu, I know, okay? Huicheng, hmm.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,040
Yayan, I also feel that we can't go back.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,680
Xiumin, why did they get together?

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,599
Xiumin, why are they
together? Liyuan: Let's chat.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
Xiumin, didn't we just chat earlier? Liyuan:
Maybe they had a really enjoyable conversation.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,519
Xiumin, are you angry? Liyuan: No.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,239
Xiumin, are you jealous? Liyuan: No.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,120
Liyuan is just angry that
he is indifferent to me.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,600
Huicheng, go back to the room and rest.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,120
Where does Huicheng need to rest?

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,239
Liyuan came over and held her hand.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,469
Liyuan, is it fun? Yayan: Me? Um...

29
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,119
Liyuan, I envy you guys for
being able to chat so well.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,319
I dare not even look at his face.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,120
Dongxu, can we go to the base now? LiYuan:
Yeah, we can go. Let's go see my drawings.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
LiYuan: Let Huicheng be alone, okay?

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,039
LiYuan: Take him (Huicheng) with us.

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
What?

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,440
LiYuan: Actually, I wanted to pretend not to
know, but I heard too clearly. Yayan: I'm sorry.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
LiYuan: Although it should be kept confidential, the
sound insulation is really poor, right? Yayan: I'm sorry.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,840
Yayan, my older sister is so cool.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,319
Xiumin, I can't understand
what that brother is thinking.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,520
Xiumin, I also can't quite understand
who he's interested in from the beginning.

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,919
Dongxu, he himself said
he's keeping an open mind.

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,640
Liyuan, why does he need to be open-minded?

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Liyuan, the only one whose
heart is towards him is me.

43
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,830
What's going on?

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,599
What did they talk about, Xiumin?

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Nothing much, Yayan.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Yayan: It's just... well... um.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Yayan: It's that kind of thing.

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,600

161
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Huicheng: Oh? It's singular now.
Chengyun: Hahaha, because of this, right?

162
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,159
Chengyun: Who is going? Yayan?
Huicheng: Yayan and Liyuan.

163
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,320
Chengyun, is it Yulian's
older sister? Huicheng: Yeah.

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,759
Huicheng, you're not taking
responsibility, are you?

165
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Chengyun: But... because I'm not the
one who is supposed to go. Huicheng: Yeah.

166
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,950
Let's go. Let's go.

167
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,240
Yayan: Ah... Should I go
to the basketball court?

168
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,000
Xiumin: Sister...

169
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,840
Yayan: No, I'll go to the swimming
pool instead. Xiumin: Yeah, really.

170
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,360
Xiumin: Where did Liu
Dongxu go? Liu Dongxu.

171
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,320
Liyuan, don't know if she is getting ready?

172
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,160
Is Liyuan working hard to show you her abs by
exercising? Xiumin: Sister, don't say these things! Geez.

173
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,240
Correct answer.

174
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,480
Chuu is really going crazy!

175
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,640
Yuqing is so adorable.
Why are you so cute?

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,120
Dongxu: Wow!

177
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,910
-Hello -Hello

178
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,360
Boarded the bus to the basketball court.

179
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,560
Minjian, you've sweated a lot.

180
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Junrong, are you totally Huicheng? Youli, yeah,
I hope I won't become Huicheng. What should I do?

181
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,560
Youli, I've become Chengyun, the ice cream.

182
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,560
Youli, I've turned into ice cream and
melted. Chengyun, let me take a photo.

183
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,560
Minjian, do you want some ice water?
Junrong, do you want to drink water?

184
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
Chengyun, it's very cold.

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,660
Junrong, is it refreshing?
It's great, right?

186
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,280
What is it?
Junrong, is it refreshing?
It's great, right?

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,670
Junrong, is it refreshing?
It's great, right?

188
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,520
Uh-huh.
Junrong, is it refreshing?
It's great, right?

189
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,990
Uh-huh.

190
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,160
Hui Ren: Oh, it's a real gymnasium.
Jun Rong: Are there fake gymnasiums too?

191
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,339
Hui Ren: Why is it so big? You Li: It
looks like the gymnasium in our country.

192
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,770
Uh-huh.

193
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,800
Min Jian: Bro, can you dunk? Jun
Rong: No, I have poor jumping ability.

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,000
You Li: What is it? Turns out it's for looking in the
mirror. Jun Rong: Just wanted to check my hairstyle.

195
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,420
- Really? - Hmm

196
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:42,960
Can you?

197
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,290
Huiran, can you perform? Can you perform?
Minjian: Hmm, please perform. I'll catch the ball.
Can you?

198
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,640
Huiran, can you perform? Can you perform?
Minjian: Hmm, please perform. I'll catch the ball.

199
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Huiran: Not yet, it doesn't count.

200
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,440
Give it to me.

201
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,360
Minjian: But she's really good.

202
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,896
Youli: Are you going to perform? Are you
going to perform? Are you going to perform?

203
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,240
Minjian: Wow, just like an
athlete. Your legs are so long.

204
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
Yuli?

205
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,150
Yuli, this is a bit... Joon
Rong, let's interview him.

206
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,400
This is a bit...
Yuli, this is a bit... Joon
Rong, let's interview him.

207
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,150
This is a bit...

208
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,919
Yuli, you know you have
to throw the ball in, right?

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,960
Joon Rong: Ah! So that's how it is.

210
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,200
So...
Joon Rong: Ah! So that's how it is.

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,960
So...

212
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,150
Joon Rong: Ah! So that's how it is.

213
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,650
So...
Joon Rong: Ah! So that's how it is.

214
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:23,840
Joon Rong: Ah! So that's how it is.

215
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:23,920
So on that side...
Pretending to be garlic.
Joon Rong: Ah! So that's how it is.

216
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
So on that side...
Pretending to be garlic.

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Hui Ren: No, we need to move it! Yuli: Basketball
is about throwing the ball into the basket.

218
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,380
Basketball - like this, like this
Hui Ren: No, we need to move it! Yuli: Basketball
is about throwing the ball into the basket.

219
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,440
Hui Ren: No, we need to move it! Yuli: Basketball
is about throwing the ball into the basket.

220
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,359
You don't know, do you, Yuri? It's okay.
Junrong: I thought I had to guard the basket.

221
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,800
Yuri: It's supposed to be thrown in~

222
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Great.

223
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,540
What's going on?

224
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,950
Amazing.

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Minjian: She made 3 shots.

226
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,760
Junrong: Yuri is really
good, even better than me.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,380
I'm the worst here.

228
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,440
Yuri: I want to make a shot.

229
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,800
Yuli, wait a moment.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,520
Junrong, you're amazing, right?

231
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,370
Junrong, maybe we should
leave the two of us.

232
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:14,560
Okay.
The ball won't fly away, right?
Junrong, maybe we should
leave the two of us.

233
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,050
Okay.
The ball won't fly away, right?

234
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,640
Yuli, come on, come on, come on.

235
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,830
What's wrong?

236
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,550
It's not that.

237
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
Junrong, I'll catch the ball.

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,640
No.
Junrong, is this dog training?

239
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,280
- This won't work - What's wrong?

240
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,520
Youli: Wow, we really played well.

241
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Minjian: Very good.

242
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,889
Zhenglie: Won't we
play too many events now?

243
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:47,920
We originally came to play basketball.

244
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,550
JaeJae: Almost like the Asian Games.
We originally came to play basketball.

246
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,070
- Asian Games - Are you playing Wii?

247
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,240
JaeJae: Seeing this reminds me...

248
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
Why are we only focused
on drinking alcohol?

249
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,480
JaeJae: There are so
many healthy activities.

250
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
Cheng Yun, one, two, three, wooden person

251
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,560

Cheng Yun, unable to come out (?)... How
can you say you lose if you can't come out

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,070
What is it?

257
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
Hui Ren, did you catch me?

258
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,010
Wait a moment, it's so hot

259
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,440
Seriously?

260
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,539
Hui Ren, let's take a break, okay?
Yu Li: Hmm, let's take a break. OK

261
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
- Take a break - OK

262

Yuli, have a drink

263
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,519
Yuli, who wants to drink this?

264
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,320
Yuli, there are also
peach-flavored ones here

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,280
Yuli, they taste really good

266
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,059
Walking outside with Seongyun and Yuli

267
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,730
It's so much fun

268
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,720
Seongyun, let's go Yuli: Mhm

269
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:03,710
Arriving at the supermarket

270
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,500
- Hello - Hello
Arriving at the supermarket

271
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,200
Arriving at the supermarket

272
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,239
Yuli, can we buy some
Burabocon? (Note: ice cream)

273
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,300
Chengyun, why not buy Cool Summer Hunting? Yesterday
Huiran ate Cool Summer Hunting (Note: ice cream)

274

Cool Summer Hunting?

Hmm.
Yuyi: Hmm, I ate Cool Summer
Hunting yesterday. Chengyun: Right.

278
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,300
Hmm.

279
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,880
Last night.

280
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,280
Remember the ice cream that Huiran ate.

281
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,240
Chengyun: Where did everyone go?
They are here. Where did you go?

282
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,930
We bought Cool Summer Expedition.

283
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,760
Do you like eating Cool Summer Hunting?

284
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,599
Huirun, Youli, and Chengyun
went to buy ice cream.

285
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,119
Huirun and Chengyun pointed
out the ice cream that I like.

286
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,280
Huirun: Oh? This is the one that Huirun likes,
right? We bought it because I heard Youli say it.

287
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,240
Huirun: So, I think...

288
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
He is taking care of me.

289
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,000
A girl's heart is moved.

290
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,380
- Well, there's no other way, right?
- Right.

291
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,600
Huicheng, do some warm-up exercises.

292
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,280
Yayan, do you want to take a picture?

293
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,540
Let's make good expressions
and take the picture like this.

294
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,070
Okay.

295
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Liyuan, I hope the sun sets soon.
Yayan, has it already started to set?

296
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,119
Yayan, barefoot, right?

297
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,600
Liyuan is too cold

298
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
What's going on?

299
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,400
Yayan, sister, it's deeper than I imagined

300
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,940
- Sister, can I go into the water?
- Yes, you can go into the water

301
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,199
Liyuan is too cold

302
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,680
- I think it's too cold, I don't
want to go in - Oh, you swim well

303
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,730
Huicheng, oh, you swim really
well, very good, very good, very good
- I think it's too cold, I don't
want to go in - Oh, you swim well

304
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,720
Huicheng, oh, you swim really
well, very good, very good, very good

305
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,416
Wait a moment, 1 2 3 Hui Cheng, how
did you become such a good swimmer?

306
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,209
Li Yuan: Hey, I can
also do the doggy paddle.

307
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,380
-Help me get that. -This one?

308
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:04,560
Hui Cheng didn't notice Li Yuan.

309
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,510
-Isn't it this one?
Hui Cheng didn't notice Li Yuan.

310
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,120
Hui Cheng didn't notice Li Yuan.

311
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,549
JaeJae: Hui Cheng, please take a look...!!!

312
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,750
Chuu: Li Yuan also
wants you to take a look.

313
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,580
Li Yuan: I can also do the backstroke.

314
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,600
But...

315
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,030
Hui Cheng: Coming here means getting wet.

316
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,120
Liyuan, doesn't he look a bit like
a lifeguard? I didn't recognize him.

317
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,550
Huicheng, the lifeguard is here.

318
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,125
Sister, sister.

319
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,080
Huicheng, is it fun playing?

320
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,240
Liyuan, who knows how to swim?

321
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,360
Huicheng, come quickly, it's really fun.

322
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,470
Dongxu, how was it? Did you do well in
diving? Huicheng: Mhm, very well, very well.

323
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,470
What?
Dongxu, how was it? Did you do well in
diving? Huicheng: Mhm, very well, very well.

324
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,840
Dongxu, how was it? Did you do well in
diving? Huicheng: Mhm, very well, very well.

325
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,070
Sister, take a look.
Just go in.

326
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,440
Yeah, I also want to go in.

327
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,490
It's not me.

328
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Water.

329
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,370
It's coming over.

330
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,216
Huicheng, did you capture everything?
Li Yuan, did you capture something funny?

331
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
Li Yuan, no. What are you doing? You lost.

332
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,680
Li Yuan, oh! Why is he so good at swimming?
Huicheng, he used to be a swimmer.

333
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,360
Dongxu, he originally came
from a swimming background.

334
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,600
Dongxu, the only thing he can
pride himself on is swimming.

335
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,680
Has Dongxu ever swam in the
sea? Has he never swam before?

336
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
Dongxu hopes to have the
opportunity to swim together.

337
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,720
Dongxu shows off his swimming skills.

338
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,000
The seals in this area.

339
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,960
Xiumin has been boasting
about his swimming abilities.

340
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,200
Xiumin is very good at swimming...

341
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
Very cute.

342
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,680
Xiumin wants to hurry up and
praise him, he must be praised.

343
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,520
Successfully showcasing charm

344
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,150
Invisible

345
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,200
Liyuan, how about running?
How about running in water?

346
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,199
Huicheng, from here to there

347
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,810
How to run

348
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,340
From here to there

349
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
- Where - Run

350
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,720
Liyuan, but how do I run here? Yayan,
wait a moment, I'm holding two cameras

351
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
Huicheng, give me one Yayan,
do you want to help me hold it?

352
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,225
Let's go together.

353
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,680
Yayan, is this being filmed?

354
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,440
Liyuan, come on, is this right?

355
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,679
Ah, this composition...

356
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,640
Chuu, standing in the position
of unrequited love, really...

357
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,960
Chuu, you really don't care
about me, oh... like this.

358
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,300
I'll help you take the photo.

359
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,639
Liyuan, just the two of us?
Huicheng: Hmm, I'll follow you guys.

360
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,160
Liyuan: 1, 2, 3.

361
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,360
Liyan, how should I run like this?

362
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,400
Huicheng, I'm here to cause trouble.

363
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,280
Yayan, ah.

364
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,600
Yayan, ah, I found it all!

365
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,280
Liyan, my mood has been bad
since that day in the secret room.

366
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,590
Help me open it.

367
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,839
Liyan, ah, is that Huicheng? It sounds like Huicheng's
voice, right? Xiumin, isn't it Yayan, sister?

368
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,360
Li Yuan, that is to say, with Ya Yan.

369
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,320
Li Yuan, it seems Hui Cheng is here.

370
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,920
Ya Yan, can we do it again?
Hui Cheng: "Eh ah ah," is this it?

371
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,230
Xiu Min: Ah, they seem to be chatting.

372
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,880
On the bus.
Xiu Min: Ah, they seem to be chatting.

373
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,230
On the bus.

374
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,390
Li Yuan hears Hui Cheng's laughter,
which she has never heard before.

375
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,600
All by herself.
Li Yuan hears Hui Cheng's laughter,
which she has never heard before.

376
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:03,820
Li Yuan hears Hui Cheng's laughter,
which she has never heard before.

377
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,350
Really, really like this.
Li Yuan hears Hui Cheng's laughter,
which she has never heard before.

378
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,400
Li Yuan hears Hui Cheng's laughter,
which she has never heard before.

379
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,319
Li Yuan, let's go to the
swimming pool, Hui Cheng.

380
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,920
Huicheng swimming pool? Li Yuan: Uh-huh.

381
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,200
Huicheng, I'm considering... Do we
really want to go to the swimming pool?

382
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,519
Ya Yan: I want to swim.

383
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,720
Huicheng: Let's go for a swim.

384
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,839
Li Yuan: Uh-huh... Actually, I already told Huicheng at
the beginning that I wanted to go to the swimming pool.

385
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,360
Li Yuan: But Huicheng
only takes care of Ya Yan.

386
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,360
Ya Yan: Is the water cold?
Huicheng: Should we warm up first?

387
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,310
Liyuan, I don't know how to warm up.

388
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
Where is the mobile phone?
Liyuan, I don't know how to warm up.

389
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,350
Where is the mobile phone?

390
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,439
Yayan, the mobile phone? Huicheng,
I didn't bring the mobile phone.

391
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,320
Yayan, I brought ours, it's okay.

392
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
Huicheng can't hear Liyuan's voice.

393
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,460
Looks good.
Huicheng can't hear Liyuan's voice.

394
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,600
Huicheng can't hear Liyuan's voice.

395
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,360
Come warm up.

396
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,810
1 2.

397
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm so excited.

398
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,840
2 2.

399
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,310
Huicheng, I am the captain of the school's sports
team, so I have done that in front of the whole school…
2 2.

400
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,540
Huicheng, I am the captain of the school's sports
team, so I have done that in front of the whole school…

401
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,249
Sister, this hurts so much.
Huicheng, I am the captain of the school's sports
team, so I have done that in front of the whole school…

402
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:51,250
Huicheng, I am the captain of the school's sports
team, so I have done that in front of the whole school…

403
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,720
Ah.
Huicheng, I am the captain of the school's sports
team, so I have done that in front of the whole school…

404
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:51,820
Ah.

405
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,740
I did it with a microphone.

406
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,610
What is this?

407
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,109
Liyuan is not talking.

408
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,390
This is a warm-up.
It hurts here.

409
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,050
Where?

410
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,479
Huicheng's heart is really ambiguous.

411
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,840
Liyuan, I try to pretend that "I'm fine"...

412
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,919
Liyuan, shall we go eat something
delicious? Yayan: Sister, sure.

413
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,200
Liyuan, shall we go and
have some delicious food?

414
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,450
Shangxun, ah, there's also Dongxu
and Xiumin, so Liyuan is even more...

415
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:34,800
Yes.
Shangxun, ah, there's also Dongxu
and Xiumin, so Liyuan is even more...

416
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes.

417
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,350
Shangxun, they do tend to be cautious
because they are all in couples.
Yes.

418
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,519
Shangxun, they do tend to be cautious
because they are all in couples.

419
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,580
Zhenglie, they will feel even lonelier.

420
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,400
- Mm. - Right.
Zhenglie, they will feel even lonelier.

421
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,770
- Mm. - Right.

422
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,350
Yayan, it must be very delicious.

423
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,480
We don't have time.
Yayan, it must be very delicious.

424
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:44,540
We don't have time.

425
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,800
Huicheng, wow, what is it?

426
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,630
That's awesome.

427
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,680
Ya Yan, I'm starting.

428
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,361
Hui Cheng, is this different from
this one? Ya Yan, it seems like it?

429
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,640
Hui Cheng, let me help
everyone cut. Ya Yan, thank you.

430
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,409
Fried chicken is difficult to cut.

431
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,860
Is there anyone who cannot eat?

432
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,380
No, it's edible.

433
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,100
Li Yuan, just eat it. You eat it directly.

434
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,390
Just now you were so confident.
Li Yuan, just eat it. You eat it directly.

435
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,920
Li Yuan, just eat it. You eat it directly.

436
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,360
Hui Cheng, can I eat the chicken
leg? Li Yuan, yes, go ahead.

437
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,160
Huicheng toilet paper...
Yayan, should I go get it?

438
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,396
Liyuan, I'll go get it for you.
No need, no need.

439
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,856
I'll go get it for you.
Yayan, no need, no need.

440
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
Yayan, everyone wait a
moment, I'll go get it.

441
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Chicken breast meat.

442
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:46,280
Huicheng, I also want to go.

443
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,240
Don't stand up...! Right... I'm
just afraid it will be like that...

444
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
Shangxun, ah, wait a moment...

445
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,160
Chuu, knew it would be like this.

446
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,440
Chicken breast

447
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Huicheng, I also want to go

448
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,350
Is it necessary like this?

449
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,520
Liyuan, what's wrong?

450
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,840
Liyuan, they look very good together

451
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,120
In Liyuan's eyes, they look very close

452
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,440
Liyuan, Huicheng and Yayan
are having a great time

453
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,359
Liyuan, Yayan is my best friend.
Huicheng now knows my feelings too

454
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,800
Liyuan, that's why I feel very jealous

455
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,920
I'm so tired...

456
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,639
What should I do with this love? If someone pats
her at that time, I feel like tears will fall.

457
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,280
This love feels so
exhausting at that time...

458
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,360
Shang Xun, it really feels
like the sky is falling...

459
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,580
My heart hurts so much.

460
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,840
At the end of Li Yuan's
gaze is Hui Cheng and Ya Yan.

461
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,880
Ya Yan, this is for
you. Dong Xu, thank you.

462
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,440
Dong Xu, you seem a bit tired,
sister? Li Yuan: Me? A bit...

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,080
Yuri's heart is very complicated.

464
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,080
The boys and girls who went to
the basketball court are back.

465
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,150
What should we do about Suho? If he hasn't come back yet...
Minjian: He said he's fine. We just spoke on the phone.

466
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,150
Yes.
What should we do about Suho? If he hasn't come back yet...
Minjian: He said he's fine. We just spoke on the phone.

467
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,600
What should we do about Suho? If he hasn't come back yet...
Minjian: He said he's fine. We just spoke on the phone.

468
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,240
What's wrong?
What should we do about Suho? If he hasn't come back yet...
Minjian: He said he's fine. We just spoke on the phone.

469
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,300
What's wrong?

470
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,670
We just spoke on the phone.

471
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,079
Suho got injured while playing basketball.

472
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,170
Shanghun: Huh? He got injured?
- What happened? What happened? - Did he get injured?

473
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,960
It seems like he got injured
Shanghun: Huh? He got injured?
- What happened? What happened? - Did he get injured?

474
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,290
It seems like he got injured

475
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,450
Was it when JaeJae was playing basketball?

476
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,240
Ouch
Was it when JaeJae was playing basketball?

477
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,320
Was it when JaeJae was playing basketball?

478
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,860
Oh dear, what should we do

479
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:13,649
JaeJae is indeed very serious about playing

480
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,039
Hmm

481
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,680
Min-jeon, he said not to worry, he's fine

482
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,919
The boys and girls who went to
the swimming pool are back too

483
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,019
Yayeon, look at the stars,
they're really beautiful

484
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,370
So beautiful

485
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,579
Huicheng, that's awesome

486
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,180
Really a lot. Huicheng, when can
we have such an experience again?

487
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,549
Yayan, the stars are so beautiful.
Dongxu: Wow, so many stars.

488
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,870
Mm, really a lot.

489
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,320
Yayan, I looked up for the first time
and found... it's so beautiful, right?

490
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,639
Dongxu, sister is about
to cry. Yayan, sister...

491
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,119
Liyuan, seeing the stars makes me a little
sentimental. Yayan, yeah, seeing the stars.

492
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,189
Liyuan feels nostalgic when she sees
stars. Yayan finds stars very moving.

493
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,850
Yes.

494
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,599
Yayan is very beautiful, right?

495
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,520
Liyuan: Yes.

496
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,720
Yayan: Sister is even
more beautiful. Liyuan: OK.

497
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,200
What is this? Is it really?

498
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,620
Oh.

499
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,280
Yayan: Hi.

500
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Junrong: Are you having
fun? Yuli: Is it fun?

501
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,639
Huiran, is it fun? Yuli, is it fun?

502
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,360
Yayan, let's put this in.

503
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,440
Huicheng, do the bosses have to
tidy up? Yayan, huh? What did you say?

504
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,240
Huicheng, do the bosses have to tidy
up? Yayan, we have to tidy up, you know?

505
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,610
Mhm.

506
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,040
Just put this inside.

507
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
Liyuan, sigh...

508
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,960
Liyuan, looks like I don't have to tidy up.

509
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,750
Liyuan, it seems like I
don't need to tidy up anymore.

510
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,750
Gone.
None left?
Liyuan, it seems like I
don't need to tidy up anymore.

511
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:56,760
Liyuan, it seems like I
don't need to tidy up anymore.

512
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,020
Hmm.

513
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,240
Where did they go?

514
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,399
Yayan, didn't you say you
were coming out directly?

515
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,640
Yayan, do you know how long we've been
waiting outside? Yuli, what are you doing?

516
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,590
Just like this.

517
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:20,079
Yuli, tell us. What have you been up to?

518
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,280
Yuli, have you completely
gone into hiding? Yayan: Yes.

519
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,230
Really

520
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,920
Huicheng, the water level is so high for girls.
Yayan, what are you talking about? It's not that high.

521
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Is it true?
Huicheng, the water level is so high for girls.
Yayan, what are you talking about? It's not that high.

522
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,520
Huicheng, the water level is so high for girls.
Yayan, what are you talking about? It's not that high.

523
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,546
Huicheng, isn't it? Yayan,
maybe it's only up to here?

524
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,250
I'll do this, you do that.

525
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,690
OK, I'll use this one. This one is wet.

526
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,540
Is it true? Wow.

527
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,490
It's really funny.

528
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,519
Xiumin, I've been watching my sister cry all
the time. I care a lot, but I can't do anything.

529
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,560
Liyuan, it's okay, it's
okay, don't worry about me.

530
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,110
Xiumin, is it heartache?
Is it because of love?

531
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,110
What?
Xiumin, is it heartache?
Is it because of love?

532
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,320
Xiumin, is it heartache?
Is it because of love?

533
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,360
Yeah, it's love.

534
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,719
Liyuan, have you been in a relationship
before? Huicheng: Yeah, of course I have.

535
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,959
Huicheng, but none of the relationships
lasted long. Liyuan: Ah, really?

536
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,820
Liyuan: It seems like you haven't
reached the stage of love yet.

537
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,200
What's that?
Liyuan: It seems like you haven't
reached the stage of love yet.

538
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,460
Liyuan hasn't reached
the point of love yet.
What's that?

539
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,680
Liyuan hasn't reached
the point of love yet.

540
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,069
Love?

541
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,340
Love

542
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,119
Xiumin, is this the pain of love...?

543
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,879
Liyuan, this is not love.
Xiumin, then what is it...?

544
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,960
Liyuan, this is just a liking.

545
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,289
Xiumin... what is love? Liyuan, love?

546
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,290
Hmm

547
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,680
Can you die for him?

548
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,519
Is Liyuan in love?

549
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Liyuan, is it a heart that
cherishes him more than oneself?

550
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,000
Liyuan, will remember it for a lifetime.

551
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,280
What is first love to Liyuan?

552
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,000
It's so romantic for
Liyuan to walk here barefoot.

553
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,199
Huicheng, what about your pants...
Does it matter? Liyuan: Let it get wet!

554
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,840
Huicheng: Well, it's better to
let the pants get wet. Liyuan: Yes.

555
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760
Huicheng: Let's come and see the sea today.

556
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,829
It's really great, I feel so happy.

557
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,890
Hmm.

558
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,759
Liyuan: I feel like this will stay in
my memory forever, right? Huicheng: Yes.

559
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,320
Liyuan: I will remember it
forever! I really will! Huicheng: Yes.

560
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,450
Believing that love is something
to remember for a lifetime.

561
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,440
Will keep in mind for a lifetime
Believing that love is something
to remember for a lifetime.

562
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:26,650
Believing that love is something
to remember for a lifetime.

563
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,400
That kind of heart that
cherishes him more than myself
Believing that love is something
to remember for a lifetime.

564
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,940
That kind of heart that
cherishes him more than myself

565
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,080
The first encounter

566
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,559
Huicheng, do you wear perfume?

567
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,760
Huicheng, do you smell and
see if there is a fragrance?

568
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,320
Hmm

569
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,176
Huicheng, is there a fragrance?
Is it pleasant? Li Yuan: Hmm

570
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,640
Very sweet
A very sweet scent, isn't it?

571
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,306
Although we are still not very familiar with each other
but I want to get closer to him in the coming days.

572
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,070
I should be able to do this

573
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:51,930
Do you know what the majors of other people
are? But Huicheng's major is really surprising

574
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,470
I am here like this
Do you know what the majors of other people
are? But Huicheng's major is really surprising

575
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,120
Do you know what the majors of other people
are? But Huicheng's major is really surprising

576
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,560
Fell in love... sob

577
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,340
It's over

578
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:14,040
Yuri, ideal type? What kind of feeling do
you like? Or personality? Liyuan, Huicheng

579
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,260
Oh my god

580
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,719
Liyuan, I fell in love
with Huicheng at first sight

581
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,520
Liyuan, my mind is full
of Huicheng right now

582
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,720
Where will Liyuan Huicheng sit?

583
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,079
Liyuan, do you want to stick
it? Huicheng, this is for burns!

584
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,479
Liyuan, really? Huicheng, yes.

585
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,920
Liyuan, you're kidding.
Huicheng, you should apply this.

586
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,180
Like this, then press here.

587
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,410
Here?

588
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,550
Yes, here.

589
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,120
Huicheng, it's already good that it can make this kind of
sound for the first time. Liyuan, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

590
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,170
No need to worry. You are by my side.

591
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,309
Is this love just for me?

592
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,730
Why is it so beautiful?

593
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Thank you.

594
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Huicheng, this is the most
beautiful sea I have ever seen.

595
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,529
I wish my name was the sea.

596
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,530
Sea.
Mm.

597
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,530
Liyuan, he said he is
happy to be by the seaside.

598
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,480
Mm.
Liyuan, he said he is
happy to be by the seaside.

599
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:17,530
Mm.

600
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:21,729
Liyuan, but he always says thank you to me.

601
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,730
Mm.

602
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,149
Although I have been
lingering around the young man,

603
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,279
He remains indifferent.

604
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,399
Liyuan, what does he think?

605
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,589
Liyuan, I have absolutely no idea.

606
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,440
Liyuan, he doesn't say anything either...

607
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,590
Huicheng, we're back~ Huiren, You
scared me! I thought no one was here.

608
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,479
Liyuan, even though I'm very disappointed,

609
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,839
Liyuan, in the past Huicheng would say, "Sister,
what's wrong with you?" and come to my side.

610
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,760
Liyuan, but now it won't be like this.

611
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,720
Liyuan, sigh...

612
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,150
Liyuan, it was great when we
went to see the sea yesterday.

613
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,646
Liyuan, do you have any crush
on someone of the opposite sex?

614
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:05,000
There is no "person who
completely attracts me".

615
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,920
Even if I gather up courage to get close,
my girl's heart still doesn't reach him.

616
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,040
Yayan, everyone wait, I'll go get it.

617
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,720
This chicken breast.

618
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,960
Liyuan avoids me and
takes good care of Yayan.

619
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,640
Very heartbroken.

620
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Feeling like I've been
abandoned by Huicheng.

621
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,960
Liyuan, but I don't know
if he likes me or the ocean.

622
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Huicheng seems to prefer the ocean more.

623
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,239
But still, Huicheng.

624
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,240
My playlist, listening to "Trust-40-", I want to pick the stars and give them to you. I want to give you
everything I have. Sometimes I cry, afraid of losing you. Sometimes I can also feel you sleeping in my arms.

625
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,755
If JaeJae is your ideal type, it's
hard to take back your feelings...

626
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:09,460
- That's right. - This one.

627
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,680
On a night when everyone fell asleep,

628
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,720
Huicheng turned on the light.

629
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Huicheng just feels very chaotic.

630
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,120
Weaving all the way into the deep night.

631
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,199
The sleepless night gradually deepens.

632
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,160
A little recording from the first day.

633
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,520
Friend X who I liked at first sight,
Huicheng didn't write about anyone.

634
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,120
Liang Huicheng Xuan Yayan, matching
Yayan's name for fortune-telling.

635
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,440
Hello everyone, I'm Yayan.

636
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,200
-Hello -Hello everyone, hello everyone.

637
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,750
Hello everyone.

638
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,879
Huicheng, when Yayan got on the car

639
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,320
Huicheng's way of greeting
everyone left a deep impression on me

640
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,920
Huicheng's first impression
of Yayan is very deep

641
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,360
Huicheng, the next day, didn't we
study the main course for girls? But...

642
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,510
Spent some time with Yayan alone

643
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,620
-Feeling dizzy and confused -Me and you
Spent some time with Yayan alone

644
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:55,780
Spent some time with Yayan alone

645
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,040
I guessed it.
Spent some time with Yayan alone

646
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,570
I guessed it.

647
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,679
Huicheng, when I first saw her on
the bus, I thought she must be a dancer.

648
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
Huicheng later saw her dancing ballet...

649
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,880
Huicheng guessed Yayan's major.

650
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,790
He thought she looked
handsome when she danced ballet.

651
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,510
He thought she was handsome.
He thought she looked
handsome when she danced ballet.

652
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,200
He thought she looked
handsome when she danced ballet.

653
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,590
His feelings for her became stronger.

654
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,970
So handsome.
His feelings for her became stronger.

655
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,000
His feelings for her became stronger.

656
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,400
- Do you know the name game?
- The name game? That night

657
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,200
Do you know?

658
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,840
Junrong, can I ask a question?

659
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,840
Playing the whispering game with friends

660
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,240
Huicheng, Yayan Yayan, is it me?

661
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,429
The person who wants to
teach him piano the most

662
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,130
Because you helped me today

663
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,000
Dongxu: Ohhh~ you two~ what's going on?

664
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,040
Huicheng said without hesitation, "Yayan"

665
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:56,040
But the young man that
Yayan likes is Chengyun.

666
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,790
Yayan gave the keychain to Chengyun.

667
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,000
It is a gift.
Yayan gave the keychain to Chengyun.

668
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
Yayan gave the keychain to Chengyun.

669
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Huicheng, who gave it to you?

670
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,520
Chengyun, Yayan? Huicheng, Yayan...

671
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,320
I know that Yayan has expressed
her feelings to Chengyun.

672
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,960
Because Huicheng and Chengyun
have a special relationship.

673
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,480
Huicheng, you did well,
huh? Yayan, not bad, right?

674
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,239
Yayan, this is organized.
Didn't you say you were going?

675
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,159
Hui Cheng, you did a great job~

676
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,360
Ya Yan, from crisis to success?

677
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,880
Can only express feelings cautiously.

678
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,799
Hui Cheng, Ya Yan, what do
you want to eat? Ya Yan, what?

679
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,839
Ya Yan, do you want takeout?

680
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,719
Today? Of course, it's good.

681
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,700
Hui Cheng, what do you want to eat?
Ya Yan, what everyone wants to eat...

682
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,040
I heard that there is a BHC nearby.
Hui Cheng, what do you want to eat?
Ya Yan, what everyone wants to eat...

683
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,100
I heard that there is a BHC nearby.

684
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,959
Yayan, I really like it. I want to
eat cheese balls. Huicheng: Really?

685
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,880
Huicheng, can you order one today?

686
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,560
Huicheng observed the
food Yayan likes to eat.

687
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Seonyun: Oh! It's Huicheng.
Huicheng: You're back? Finally back.

688
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,720
Seonyun: Went to a farm. Huicheng: Really?

689
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,479
Huicheng, who are you with?
Yayan? Chengyun: Yeah, with Yayan.

690
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,040
How is Huicheng?

691
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,599
Chengyun: Oh... very interesting.

692
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
Huicheng: Yeah...

693
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,880
Huiren: We went to the rice fields.
Chengyun: Very... I heard they are very vast?

694
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:20,030
- You went to the farm.
- We went to the rice fields.

695
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:22,719
Only focusing on Yayan, who
has her heart set on Chengyun.

696
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,440
Yayan: Are there also
curious people like me? But...

697
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,189
Yesterday was reset.

698
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,960
Did it start from the beginning?

699
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,879
The time for Huicheng to
get closer to her has come.

700
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,319
Huicheng gets along with Yayan very comfortably
and naturally, always having something to say.

701
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,359
Huicheng, is there a change
in your inner... state?

702
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,920
Minjian, what about you?

703
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,599
Huicheng, I don't know.
Honestly, I'm a bit frustrated.

704
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,620
Same here.

705
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,240
Huicheng, to some extent, I
may still have Yayan on my mind.

706
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,360
Other worries of young boys

707
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,920
Huicheng is lost and confused

708
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,520
Huicheng, I am already
immersed in the scenery

709
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,135
It's really great, very refreshing

710
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:27,399
Huicheng, feeling super good at the seaside

711
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,079
Huicheng, watching the
sea, when the sunset appears

712
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,240
Huicheng, feels like it expresses a lot

713
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,960
Huicheng, this is the most
beautiful sea I've ever seen

714
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,709
I wish my name could be "Ocean"

715
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,010
Calling the ocean?

716
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,240
Huicheng, so grateful, but...

717
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,119
Huicheng, is it too beautiful?

718
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,820
That's right.

719
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,200
How can the scenery be so beautiful?

720
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:58,480
Huicheng doesn't like
Liyuan, but the ocean.

721
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,080
Liyuan, don't you have
someone you like? Huicheng: Me?

722
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,210
No matter what...

723
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,000
Huicheng, someone you like...?

724
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,680
Huicheng, I may find it difficult
to accept Liyuan's expression, so...

725
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,920
Huicheng, how should I
talk to my older sister?

726
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,600
Huicheng, I have also had these worries.

727
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,400
Huicheng, so I feel very uncomfortable.

728
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Huicheng, I had a complicated night.

729
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,120
Huiren: It's 8 o'clock~ Yayan: So cold...

730
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,760
Xiumin: Am I going
crazy? Dreamt about Dongxu.

731
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,799
Xiumin: So tired, want to sleep some
more. Too sleepy. Huiren: Go back to sleep.

732
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,960
Can I go, Xiumin? Huiran,
I'll call you at 8:30.

733
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,080
Xiumin, then I'll go back to dreaming.

734
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,160
Did sister leave, Yayan? Xiumin,
Lianyuan sister really left.

735
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,920
The bed of a certain girl
has been empty since dawn.

736
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,880
Last night's girls' dormitory.

737
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:49,225
- Sister, see you tomorrow.
- I'm very busy today.

738
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:50,919
Lianyuan brought the major items.

739
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,240
Liyuan, I have an exam
tomorrow. Hui Ren, oh my!

740
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,519
Hui Ren, are you going out and coming back?

741
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,120
Hui Ren, when will you come back? Liyuan, I
will come back in the evening. Tomorrow night.

742
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,439
Liyuan temporarily left the main base.

743
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,976
JaeJae, why did you leave at this time...

744
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,839
Can't you do it later? What's the
matter? It's really inconsiderate.

745
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,609
Such a timing for love...

746
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,870
Really...

747
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,720
If Huicheng makes corn cheese
toast, it would be great! Ya Yan: Oh!

748
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
Hot dog bun! Ya Yan: It
should be delicious when heated.

749
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,640
Ya Yan: Do you want to
eat some? Hui Ren: Sure.

750
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,480
Ya Yan: How about eating
a little? Hui Ren: Okay

751
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,696
Hui Ren: If we eat, everyone should come, right? Ya Yan: I
think so Ya Yan: Should we heat everything? Hui Ren: Okay

752
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
Ya Yan: Should we heat
everything? Hui Ren: Okay

753
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,760
Yayan, I don't think any guys are
awake yet. Huiren: Hmm, I think so too.

754
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,679
Unexpectedly, everyone is awake.

755
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,559
Minjian: I dreamt about
Chengyun. Dongxu: Really?

756
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,400
Huicheng: Me too. Minjian: Is that so?

757
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,880
Yooyi: Good morning. Yayan: Yooyi~

758
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,559
Yayan: Have you had breakfast?
Yooyi: No, I just arrived now.

759
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,600
Huicheng: We need to tell
Yooyi. Yooyi: What, what?

760
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,600
Hui Ren dreamt that Cheng Yun
recovered and came over. You Li: Me too.

761
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,439
You Li: The dream felt so real, so I felt really good about
it~ Hui Ren: There were two other people who dreamt as well.

762
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,696
You Li: Oh my, that's so amazing! It's like a prophecy.
Hui Cheng: I really hope it will turn out to be true.

763
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,400
You Li: Did you have a prenatal dream(?)

764
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,690
Hui Ren: A prenatal dream?
Hui Cheng: Prenatal dream, haha.

765
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,000
Yuri
Hui Ren: A prenatal dream?
Hui Cheng: Prenatal dream, haha.

766
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,700
Yuri

767
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,919
Burst into laughter

768
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,440
California girl who
remains calm and composed

769
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,359
Ate a piece of chicken breast at night

770
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,599
Hoojin, I could still hear the piano
playing very late Yuri, that's right

771
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,760
Yuri, you're really great

772
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Yuri, the feeling you and
Su-min play is very different

773
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,920
Last night, practice room

774
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,479
Hoojin, at first we couldn't hear each other
while chatting, then suddenly fell into silence

775
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,959
Hui Ren: Oh, I'm playing
the piano... just like this.

776
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,319
Yu Li: Last time after I finished practicing,
I heard someone playing the piano.

777
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,119
Yu Li: I wonder who it
is, they play really well.

778
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,880
Ya Yan: Very soothing. Yu Li: Yes!

779
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,959
Hui Ren: Aren't you eating protein today? Dong Xu:
Because someone said they'll make it for me today.

780
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,560
Ah~~~

781
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,080
Yu Li: I see.

782
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,469
Yesterday at the base

783
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,530
Speaking of which

784
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,999
Xiumin, I already said I'm
also good at cooking, you know?

785
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,039
Dongxu, when can I see your cooking skills? Xiumin,
I'll make breakfast for you tomorrow morning.

786
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,919
Xiumin, no, I already said I'll make
breakfast for you tomorrow, brunch?

787
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,519
Sanghun, no. If I say "I'll make
breakfast for you tomorrow," then

788
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,599
Sanghun, um... it's because
of this kind of feeling...

789
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,949
Super touched

790
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:37,960
When the person I have a crush on says this

791
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,080
Sang-hoon, especially as a high school student,
says, "Shall I make breakfast for you tomorrow?"
When the person I have a crush on says this

792
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,639
Sang-hoon, especially as a high school student,
says, "Shall I make breakfast for you tomorrow?"

793
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,519
feelings, I am very happy
when I hear Sang-hoon talking

794
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,560
Sang-hoon, because I
suddenly feel very touched

795
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,590
I also want to grab a
little to eat beside him

796
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:51,800
Dong-xu has been waiting
for Xiumin since early morning

797
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,199
Hui-ren, I hope Xiumin didn't not come because she doesn't
want to cook for you. Ya Yan, that's what I'm saying

798
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,920
Would Hui Ren have to wait until 3 o'clock?

799
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,080
Dong Xu, I am looking forward to it.

800
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,360
ShowMin, trapped in distress.

801
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,880
Distressed with the Nth
set of chef's uniforms.

802
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,399
Youqing, so adorable, what should I do?

803
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,040
JaeJae, ahh, so cute. It's true.

804
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,000
Chuu, all are good, all are good.

805
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,240
Hui Ren, why do you feel so lonely? Is it
because it's raining? Yu Li, feeling so sad.

806
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,839
Dongxu's 10th hour on an empty stomach

807
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,079
Yu Li, do you know any idol dances?
Hui Ren, me? What do you want me to dance?

808
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,119
Yu Li, random dance?

809
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,200
Hui Ren, without music?

810
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,360
When girls feel lonely,
they will dance without music

811
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,480
Yu Li, you're so good at
dancing, so good at dancing

812
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,160
Yu Li, it's too funny.

813
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,560
Yayan, I'll go play
the piano and come back.

814
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,720
Yayan, wait a moment.

815
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,840
Yayan, I'll go get close to
the piano and then come back.

816
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,280
Yayan, sol, do, re, mi, fa, sol.

817
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,600
Yayan performing the "Chopsticks March".

818
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,759
The next day, a day of classes.
Let's start with this.

819
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,980
Huicheng, shall I teach you too?

820
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,400
Teach me?
Huicheng, shall I teach you too?

821
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:31,720
Yayan, I can play the "Chopsticks March".
Huicheng, you sit down, I'll teach you how to play.
Teach me?

822
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,120
Yayan, I can play the "Chopsticks March".
Huicheng, you sit down, I'll teach you how to play.

823
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,000
Learning "Chopsticks March" from Huicheng

824
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,960
Discovered Ya Yan practicing

825
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,280
Ya Yan, do re mi fa sol

826
00:49:57,281 --> 00:49:59,000
Huicheng, sit a little closer Ya Yan, OK

827
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,519
Ya Yan, play any song you like

828
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,760
Huicheng, any song? Ya Yan, yes

829
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,999
Ya Yan, it's really cool how you can play
a song just by looking at the sheet music

830
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,440
Huicheng, you mean by looking
at the sheet music? Ya Yan, yes

831
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,920
Huicheng, didn't you just play this?

832
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,280
Yayan, yes. Huicheng, try playing it.

833
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,880
Huicheng, have you improved a lot?
Yayan, should there be more coming?

834
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,439
Yayan, oh, this one is too
difficult. Huicheng, really?

835
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,240
Huicheng, just move your finger here.

836
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,160
Huicheng, just single-click
with this finger.

837
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:38,161
Do

838
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,359
Huicheng, this finger needs to go up.

839
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,600
Yayan, like this? Huicheng: Um.

840
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,280
Huicheng: This is Sol!

841
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,640
Huicheng: Um.

842
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,320
Huicheng: Here.

843
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,610
Here.

844
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,319
Yayan: Is it here? Huicheng: Um.

845
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,800
Huicheng: Only this one is different.

846
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,960
Huicheng: Um~ It sounds really good.

847
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,959
Huicheng: You should try it. Yayan: OK.

848
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Start.

849
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,359
Yayan: You brought it back to
life. Huicheng: It sounds really good.

850
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,079
Huicheng Very impressive,
you've improved so quickly

851
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,799
Yayan Have you improved?
That's great! Huicheng Hmm

852
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,759
Huicheng When did you practice?
How did you improve so quickly?

853
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,720
Yayan Is it because the teacher
taught well? Huicheng Ah, really? Haha

854
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,120
Yayan So interesting

855
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,879
Youli, Xiumin When will Xiumin come?

856
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,399
Dongxu: Ah, it's fine
even if you don't come.

857
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,320
Yuli: What? Dongxu: It's
fine if you don't come.

858
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,999
Dongxu: Then should I just have
breakfast? Yuli: No, you can't~

859
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,080
Dongxu: How about eating first and
then eating again? Yuli: You have to wait.

860
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,920
Still waiting for breakfast.

861
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,919
JaeJae: If it were me, I
would have eaten already.

862
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,880
Shangxun: If it's like that, I would
have eaten and then got hungry again.

863
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,719
Hui Ren, Dong Xu gege is waiting
for you. Xiu Min, where are you?

864
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,919
Hui Ren is in the nearby rest area.

865
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,439
Xiu Min, are you eating?
Hui Ren hasn't eaten yet.

866
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,880
Xiu Min, I said I'm making
lunch... I'm making lunch for him!

867
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,560
Dong Xu, should I go change clothes?

868
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,960
Dong Xu, too black and white.

869
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,040
You Li, do as you like~ Ah, does
today not match your character?

870
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,040
Dongxu, ah, I don't
know, it's too ordinary.

871
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,760
Yuri, what do you want? Hahaha.

872
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,480
Dongxu, it's too black and white.

873
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,680
Dongxu, I'll go to the
dormitory and come back.

874
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,600
Use fashion to relieve hunger.

875
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,879
Sanghun, did Sumin wear the first outfit?

876
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,140
Chuu, I said in the end
you would change back, right?

877
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,800
It was always going to be like this.
Chuu, I said in the end
you would change back, right?

878
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:01,920
It was always going to be like this.

879
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:05,321
Sanghun, what if we find Dongxu dead in front
of the refrigerator after it's all over?

880
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,890
Died in front of the refrigerator
Feeling faint, because too hungry

881
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,920
Yayan, Xiumin~

882
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,719
Yayan, why do you look so beautiful
today? Youli: Oh~ Beautiful, beautiful~

883
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,200
Xiumin, it's been a long time since you
dressed up nicely Yayan: Really beautiful, huh?

884
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,800
Dongxu is not in the rest room

885
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,839
Youli: Dongxu went to change clothes

886
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,120
Youli: He has been waiting, you said
you were going to help him make breakfast~

887
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,130
Yes, that's right.
Youli: He has been waiting, you said
you were going to help him make breakfast~

888
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:32,160
Youli: He has been waiting, you said
you were going to help him make breakfast~

889
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,359
Yayan, he's starving,
hasn't eaten anything.

890
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,959
Xiumin, ah, lunch! I wanted to help
him make lunch, what should we do?

891
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Xiumin, looks like we'll
have to eat at 1 o'clock.

892
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,300
And then...

893
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:44,160
Make curry for brunch.

894
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,600
Huicheng, I'll make
delicious curry for you to eat.

895
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,760
Yayan, the fragrance is amazing.

896
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,400
Yayan, do you want me to help
you get carrots? Hui Cheng: Okay.

897
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,080
Yayan also joins in making curry.

898
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,719
Xiumin: What is big
sister doing? Making curry?

899
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,200
Yayan: Hmm, curry!

900
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,730
Yuli: Oh~ Wow, purple friend.

901
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,580
Finally changed clothes. The clothes you were
wearing just now were different, right? Wasn't it?

902
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,950
Dongxu, how about
looking better than before?

903
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,660
It's really difficult.

904
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,480
Purple Boy.

905
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,990
Xiumin, what's wrong
with that purple shirt?

906
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,670
Chuu, haha, it's so funny.

907
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,590
Ah, what a nuisance!

908
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,910
Chuu, what's the matter
with that purple shirt?

909
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,270
Xiumin, what's wrong
with that purple shirt?

910
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,440
Yayan, isn't it good?
Xiumin, it's quite cute.

911
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,480
Dong Xu, is today's dish curry?

912
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,010
Min Jian, do you want to eat
it? Dong Xu, it looks delicious.

913
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:53,010
Curry.
Min Jian, do you want to eat
it? Dong Xu, it looks delicious.

914
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,300
Min Jian, do you want to eat
it? Dong Xu, it looks delicious.

915
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,930
- Yes, let's eat. - It looks delicious.

916
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:58,280
Dong Xu walks to Shiumin's side.

917
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,000
- I really want to eat. - Go ahead and eat.
Dong Xu walks to Shiumin's side.

918
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,150
Dong Xu walks to Shiumin's side.

919
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,171
It's very sweet.
Shiumin, wipe the plate dry, okay? Plate?

920
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,350
- Of course, of course. - Of course.

921
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,410
Shy Shiumin suddenly
starts wiping the plates.

922
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,850
Xiumin, I woke up too late today

923
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,140
Xiumin, so I didn't make breakfast

924
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,150
Xiumin, I'll make it for you at 12 o'clock

925
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,060
The curry is almost done

926
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,750
Minjian, is it delicious?
Huicheng, it's okay

927
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,636
Huicheng, should we say that
the texture is not very good?

928
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,136
Minjian, the texture is
not very good? Huicheng, yes

929
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,906
Minjian, then what should we add?
Huicheng, we should add chicken essence

930
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:51,930
Is that so?

931
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Need to digest first.

932
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,090
Minjian, at this level? Huicheng, hmm.

933
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,520
Huicheng, ah~ Minjian, is it delicious?

934
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,510
Huicheng, it's okay.
- Is it delicious? - It has flavor now.

935
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,610
Huicheng, it's okay. Just scoop and eat.

936
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,956
Dongxu has been fasting for 12 hours
since yesterday. Looks really delicious.

937
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,410
Yayan, looks really delicious.

938
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,520
Yayan, should we dip bread and
eat it? Youli, yes, let's eat.

939
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,890
Yayan, can I have some
bread? Huicheng: Sure~

940
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,120
Huicheng, dip it here... Ah, just eat this.

941
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,521
Yayan, can I use this to eat?
Is it okay? Huicheng: Mhmm!

942
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,150
Huicheng: Ah, you can use this to eat.

943
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:33,520
This is...
Huicheng: Ah, you can use this to eat.

944
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,050
This is...

945
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:34,480
Okay, no no, it's fine.

946
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,210
In order to make it easier for her to eat, I changed the bowl.
- It's more convenient to eat like this. - Thank you!
Okay, no no, it's fine.

947
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,506
In order to make it easier for her to eat, I changed the bowl.
- It's more convenient to eat like this. - Thank you!

948
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,570
Yayan, thank you. Yuli, let's start!

949
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,050
Huicheng, okay.
Taste testing time.

950
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,050
Yuli, how is Huicheng's
cooking? Let's try it.

951
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,680
Minjian, is it delicious?
Yayan, hmm, it's really delicious.

952
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,480
Yuli, hmm!

953
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,010
You did a great job, well done.
Yuli, hmm!

954
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,029
You did a great job, well done.

955
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,650
Yuli, ah, it's really
delicious. Huicheng, really?

956
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:01,790
That's great.

957
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,760
Yuli, but seriously, how come all
the dishes you make are so delicious?
That's great.

958
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,860
Yuli, but seriously, how come all
the dishes you make are so delicious?

959
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,076
Huicheng, it seems like
it's just sheer luck, right?

960
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,736
Yayan, it's because he's a "料性男" (a man with good cooking skills). Yuli,
you're amazing. (Note: "料性男" refers to a sexy man when it comes to cooking)

961
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,760
It's delicious.

962
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,550
It's really delicious.

963
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,350
Dongxu feels very hungry.

964
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,026
Zhenglie, ah, does he have
to endure until that time?

965
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,760
Youqing, what do we do if we're hungry?

966
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,620
Zheng Lie: Hey, just eat this
and that, isn't that enough?

967
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:22,085
If it were me,

968
00:57:22,086 --> 00:57:24,540
I would bow my head and eat curry, haha.

969
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,170
Ya Yan: Mmm~ Yu Li: Mmm~

970
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:30,160
Hui Ren: If I had known Hui Cheng was
making curry for us, I wouldn't have eaten.

971
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,530
That's right.
Hui Ren: If I had known Hui Cheng was
making curry for us, I wouldn't have eaten.

972
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,160
That's right.

973
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,960
Xiu Min: Sister, Hui Ren: Hmm?

974
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,270
Xiu Min: What should we have
for brunch? Hui Ren: What?

975
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,780
Xiumin, what should we make
for brunch? Hui Ren, brunch?

976
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,486
Hui Ren, let's make sandwiches
or something like that.

977
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,130
Hui Ren, because we have lettuce and bread.

978
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,810
Hui Ren, let's make it with eggs.

979
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,640
Xiumin, eggs? Hui Ren, yes, add some bacon.

980
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,900
Hui Ren, if you're not good at cooking, ask
Huicheng to help. Xiumin, okay, let's do that then?

981
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,270
Good
Hui Ren, if you're not good at cooking, ask
Huicheng to help. Xiumin, okay, let's do that then?

982
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:50,900
Good

983
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,330
Xiumin, can you help
me later? Huicheng: Sure

984
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,680
Xiumin, I'm going to make
brunch later Huicheng: Okay

985
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,320
Dongxu: Then I'll go back to the dorm

986
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,730
Dongxu: Let's switch to
couple outfits like you

987
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,640
Dongxu changed from a purple outfit
to a couple outfit like Xiumin's

988
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,100
The third outfit change

989
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,460
Yayan: Is it raining heavily?

990
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,940
Yayan, I need to go somewhere.

991
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,886
Junrong, are you going
to see the dog? Yayan: Yes.

992
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,320
Huicheng, shall we all go together?

993
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,000
Junrong: Let's go together.
Yayan: Are you guys coming?

994
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:45,350
Yayan: Are you here, Huicheng? Is
he not coming? Junrong: I don't know.

995
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,070
Junrong: I'm still concerned
about Tuantuan and Yunyun.

996
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,730
Yayan: Are they here?

997
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,690
Junrong, their names...
Oh my, it scared me.

998
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,629
Dongxu changed his clothes and hid inside.

999
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,250
Let's go.

1000
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,690
Why did you change clothes?

1001
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,890
I think I still need to change.

1002
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,296
Yayan, why are you acting like
this? Dongxu, let's go quickly, bro!

1003
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,960
Junrong, do we need to go see the dogs?
Dongxu, just drop me off at the dormitory.

1004
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,770
Dongxu, go change clothes again.

1005
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,839
Yayan: Huh? I have to go
alone? Have I been abandoned?

1006
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,840
What's going on?

1007
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,476
Huicheng: We were just about to go.
Yuli: We were just about to go too.

1008
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,240
Yayan: Ah, you guys are
going too? Then let's go.

1009
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,260
Yuli: You two go ahead.
Okay, okay.

1010
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,879
Yuli is very perceptive.

1011
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
Over here, over here.

1012
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,820
Yayan: I'm very familiar with Tuantuan~

1013
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,290
Huicheng, you said you
like playing bowling, right?

1014
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,460
What?
Huicheng, you said you
like playing bowling, right?

1015
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:39,559
What?

1016
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,030
Yayan, bowling? Huicheng: Yeah.

1017
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,480
Yayan, I like playing bowling.
Huicheng: Do you want to go?

1018
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,670
Is there any here?
Yayan, I like playing bowling.
Huicheng: Do you want to go?

1019
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:42,760
Is there any here?

1020
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,410
Huicheng, shall we go today? Yayan: Okay!
Is there any here?

1021
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,640
Huicheng, shall we go today? Yayan: Okay!

1022
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,150
Chuu, do you want to go? Wow!

1023
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,980
Shangxun, do you want to go on a date?

1024
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,150
This is to invite her to go together.
Zhenglie suddenly has a date?
Shangxun, do you want to go on a date?

1025
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,620
This is to invite her to go together.
Zhenglie suddenly has a date?

1026
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:51,320
That's great.

1027
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,550
Huicheng is asking Yayan
out on a date together.

1028
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,060
What do you want to do?

1029
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:55,100
Yesterday, a secret conversation.

1030
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,100
- Is it me? - Hmm.
Yesterday, a secret conversation.

1031
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,500
Yesterday, a secret conversation.

1032
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,310
What I said.
Yesterday, a secret conversation.

1033
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:57,410
What I said.

1034
00:59:57,411 --> 01:00:01,260
Huicheng, to be honest, I often
stay in the dorm. Yayan, me too.

1035
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,220
Yayan, they went out together.

1036
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:09,190
Huicheng, it seems like you
wouldn't approach others proactively?

1037
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,146
Huicheng: What do you want to do? What do you want to do? I'm not very
good at speaking this kind of language. Ya Yan: I really can't do it.

1038
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,826
Huicheng: But with your personality, as long as
someone says it, you should be able to accept it.

1039
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:15,770
Ya Yan agreed to go
on a date with Huicheng.

1040
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:16,960
Great! Fantastic!
Ya Yan agreed to go
on a date with Huicheng.

1041
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,430
Ya Yan agreed to go
on a date with Huicheng.

1042
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,580
Ya Yan: I feel like the
umbrella will be blown over.

1043
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,480
Huicheng: Let's just let it blow away together.
Let's walk this way. Ya Yan: Ah, alright. This way?

1044
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Go this way.
Huicheng: Let's just let it blow away together.
Let's walk this way. Ya Yan: Ah, alright. This way?

1045
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,870
Huicheng: Let's just let it blow away together.
Let's walk this way. Ya Yan: Ah, alright. This way?

1046
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,840
Yayan, are you good at bowling?

1047
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,950
Huicheng, it's been a
while since I played...

1048
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,560
Yayan, in the past, I used to play with
heavier balls because I was too greedy.

1049
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,710
Huicheng, did you get
injured? Yayan, no, I didn't.

1050
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,666
Huicheng, I was really blown away, hahaha.

1051
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,266
Huicheng, move the umbrella forward a bit.

1052
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,666
Yayan, like this? Huicheng, yes, forward.

1053
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,580
Yayan, if you go forward, hahaha.

1054
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,650
Huicheng, do you want to go back?

1055
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,570
Huicheng, this doesn't seem to work, right?
Yayan, wait for me, I must see the children.

1056
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,220
Huicheng, you can follow me, behind me.

1057
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,880
Huicheng, I'll block for you.
Yayan, I've blocked it, thank you!

1058
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:57,090
Huicheng is in front
helping her block the wind.

1059
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,050
- You need to treat me
better in the future - Hmm
Huicheng is in front
helping her block the wind.

1060
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,490
Huicheng is in front
helping her block the wind.

1061
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,130
Shang Xun, when I was in elementary school, my game
nickname was When I was in elementary school, that

1062
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:02,400
Game nickname was "Your Windscreen"
ID: Your Windscreen
Shang Xun, when I was in elementary school, my game

1064
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,450
Your Windscreen

1065
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,590
Hui Cheng, come out, come
out Ya Yan, oh~ Tuan Tuan~

1066
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:13,970
Ya Yan, Tuan Tuan~

1067
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,240
Ya Yan, hello~ Come over here.

1068
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,090
Yayan, come here, Tuantuan.

1069
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,470
Huicheng, it seems like they like me
more? Yayan, what did you say? Tuantuan!

1070
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,590
Isn't it so?
Tuantuan.
Huicheng, it seems like they like me
more? Yayan, what did you say? Tuantuan!

1071
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,750
I'm so happy, Tuantuan.

1072
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,670
-I'll give it to you, come
here -Are you doing well?

1073
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:38,320
Huicheng also walks to Yayan's side.

1074
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,040
Yayan, oh, so cute.

1075
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,650
Huicheng, give this to it.

1076
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,410
Yayan, what should we
feed Yunyun? Huicheng: Hmm.

1077
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,890
Yayan, it doesn't eat. Let Tuantuan eat it.

1078
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,820
Huicheng: Looks like Yunyun
is on a diet now. Yayan: Yeah~

1079
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,306
Yayan: No wonder it has lost a lot of weight.
Huicheng: Has Tuantuan been eating all this time?

1080
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,890
You.
Huicheng: You really are a greedy monster.

1081
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,770
Yayan: My hair is all
messed up from the wind.

1082
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,780
Huicheng It seems that the
wind... hasn't stopped much, huh?

1083
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,740
Yayan Come~

1084
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,960
Huicheng That's also true. It
can eat a lot. Yayan Exactly.

1085
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,190
- That's also true. It can eat a lot.
- Exactly.

1086
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,290
Yayan Yuyun should eat more.

1087
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:23,800
Huicheng's umbrella leaned towards Yayan.

1088
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,800
Here's your meal.
Huicheng's umbrella leaned towards Yayan.

1089
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,160
Huicheng's umbrella leaned towards Yayan.

1090
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,160
It doesn't eat.
Huicheng's umbrella leaned towards Yayan.

1091
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,890
Huicheng's umbrella leaned towards Yayan.

1092
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,320
For Yajian, Tuantuan and Yunyun's amusement
park is a somewhat heartbreaking place.

1093
01:02:33,321 --> 01:02:34,329
That's right.

1094
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:38,370
Shangxun, she asked Chengyun, "Do you want to go to
the convenience store?" and said, "I don't know."

1095
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,010
Yajian, will it give me a hand?

1096
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,570
Huicheng, the rain has been
dripping. Yajian, give me a hand!

1097
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,496
Yajian, oh! Did you see
it? Huicheng, did he give it?

1098
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,100
Yayan, sit down!

1099
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,770
Yayan, hands! Huicheng: Oh!

1100
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,400
Yayan: Ah, that's great!

1101
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,320
Huicheng: It doesn't do it when I'm around.

1102
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,830
I succeeded.
Huicheng: Can it still clap?

1103
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,740
Yayan: Clap!

1104
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,620
Yayan: Oh! Huicheng: Oh, very good.

1105
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,310
Huicheng: Raise both
hands, it used to do that.

1106
01:02:59,310 --> 01:02:59,540
Here it comes.
Huicheng: Raise both
hands, it used to do that.

1107
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,310
Here it comes.

1108
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,630
Huicheng, hold my hand.

1109
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,170
Yayan, you can have it.

1110
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:07,890
Huicheng, here.

1111
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,610
Yayan, it's so cute.

1112
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,890
Yayan, you can't have this
anymore. You can't eat it.

1113
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,730
Huicheng, let's go, your hair~

1114
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,046
Yayan, your hair has turned into kelp hair?
(Note: It means that the hair is stuck together)

1115
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:20,410
Huicheng, it's not that
bad, just a little messy.

1116
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,291
Huicheng, quick, open the umbrella.
Yayan, because hair will get dry~

1117
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,150
Yayan, are we leaving?

1118
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,960
Yayan, okay, I'm ready.

1119
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,770
Yayan, let's come back another time~

1120
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,920
Huicheng, bye-bye.

1121
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,140
Yayan, where did our friends
go? Weren't they supposed to come?

1122
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,480
Huicheng, looks like they didn't want to get wet in
this rain. Yayan, hahaha, that's too much, isn't it?

1123
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:54,010
Huirun, hey, him! How many
outfits did he change into anyway?

1124
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,780
Mr. Liu Dongxu, Hui Ren

1125
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,616
Hui Cheng, you changed
clothes again? Yayan, uh uh

1126
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,050
Hui Cheng, always changing clothes Hui Ren thought
you were a model, always walking the runway

1127
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:01,090
I originally wanted to wear this outfit
Hui Cheng, always changing clothes Hui Ren thought
you were a model, always walking the runway

1128
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,660
I originally wanted to wear this outfit

1129
01:04:02,661 --> 01:04:03,720
I've already changed clothes four times

1130
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,480
Because of the rain, I changed several sets
I've already changed clothes four times

1131
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:05,610
I've already changed clothes four times

1132
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:08,490
So it was you

1133
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,380
Yayan, the rain is very heavy
Jun Rong, have you seen the puppy?

1134
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,170
- Yes - Very much
Yayan, the rain is very heavy
Jun Rong, have you seen the puppy?

1135
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:11,290
Yayan, the rain is very heavy
Jun Rong, have you seen the puppy?

1136
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,930
Jun Rong, I ran away halfway while
going to see it. Yan Yan, did it stop?

1137
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,586
Jun Rong, the wind was too strong,
I felt like I would be blown away.

1138
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,490
Yan Yan, my umbrella got
blown over. Jun Rong, really?

1139
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:19,960
Yeah.
Yan Yan, my umbrella got
blown over. Jun Rong, really?

1140
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,490
Yeah.

1141
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,690
Yan Yan, I'll go back.

1142
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,980
Xiu Min, sister, come with me to the practice
room. Yan Yan, hmm! Let me go prepare first.

1143
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,880
Yayan, I'm leaving.

1144
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:41,480
Yayan prepares before the appointment.

1145
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,480
I'm leaving.
Yayan prepares before the appointment.

1146
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,540
Yayan prepares before the appointment.

1147
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:04,090
Yayan inexplicably wants to laugh.

1148
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,016
Shangxun: What are you laughing at? Behave.
- Aiyo! - What are you laughing at?

1149
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,360
Chuu: What's this~

1150
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,751
JaeJae: It's getting lively,
it's getting lively. So cute.

1151
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,980
Yayan sprays on perfume.

1152
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,090
Huicheng also sprayed perfume.

1153
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,950
Yayan is combing her hair.

1154
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,370
Huicheng is also tidying up his hairstyle.

1155
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,180
Huicheng, have you all taken it?

1156
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,710
Hesitating.

1157
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:51,380
The two of them are ready.

1158
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:00,040
Yayan's footsteps are light.

1159
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,810
Dongxu, how... how can you play so quickly?

1160
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,640
Dongxu, brother, play
"Flower dance" for me.

1161
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,470
Junrong, there are better players
here. Dongxu: Oh, right, right.

1162
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:25,120
Junrong, give it a tap. Dongxu: Alright.

1163
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,506
Shangxun, are you waiting
for 12 o'clock, Xiumin?

1164
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,040
Shangxun, Xiumin, are you
cooking? You can cook...

1165
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,800
- Xiumin - Xiumin
Shangxun, Xiumin, are you
cooking? You can cook...

1166
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:29,900
- Xiumin - Xiumin

1167
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,490
JaeJae, Xiumin, why aren't you cooking?

1168
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,256
Chuu, I'm so hungry that my
stomach is sticking to my stomach.

1169
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,510
Junrong, give it a tap. Dongxu: Alright.

1170
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,686
Junrong: I don't know. Dongxu: Brother,
is this piece of music simple or difficult?

1171
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:13,730
Dongxu: Yes, this piece.

1172
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,410
Junrong: This piece? It's not that
difficult. Dongxu: I want to play it.
Dongxu: Yes, this piece.

1173
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,190
Junrong: This piece? It's not that
difficult. Dongxu: I want to play it.

1174
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:19,740
Junrong: It's really difficult.

1175
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,730
Dongxu: Show off your skills.

1176
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,600
Me?

1177
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,290
Why do you want to play?
Junrong: Can you play "The Bell" for
us? Xiumin: I haven't practiced that piece.

1178
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,050
Junrong: Can you play "The Bell" for
us? Xiumin: I haven't practiced that piece.

1179
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,856
Dong Xu hasn't practiced,
but she can still play.

1180
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,030
Jun Rong, really? Dong
Xu, she has perfect pitch.

1181
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,040
Xiu Min, no, I don't have it.

1182
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:36,029
Xiu Min, but I have a
song I want to practice.

1183
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:36,990
What song?

1184
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:41,020
Xiu Min, but I plan to
play that song for someone.

1185
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,450
Xiu Min, please let me have a turn.

1186
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,100
Xiumin plays a small section of
the piece I've been practicing.

1187
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,900
Junrong: Oh~

1188
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,240
Dongxu: Oh~ It's "Nocturne."

1189
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,750
Xiumin: I'm practicing this one.

1190
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,290
Dongxu: Truly unique.

1191
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,310
Xiumin: I wonder who I'll play it for.

1192
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,960
Yayan: The atmosphere
is really great, isn't it?

1193
01:08:55,650 --> 01:09:00,750
Xiumin: It's just that Liu Dongxu always shows us
the photos we took in the swimming pool yesterday...

1194
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,160
Yayan, take a look. Dongxu,
take a look, take a look.

1195
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:03,750
No, it's not.
Yayan, take a look. Dongxu,
take a look, take a look.

1196
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,160
No, it's not.

1197
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,450
Dongxu, take a look at
this. Xiumin, so annoying.

1198
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,600
Yayan, oh my goodness, you scared
me. Are you two the ones in the picture?

1199
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:08,700
- No. - No, no.
Yayan, oh my goodness, you scared
me. Are you two the ones in the picture?

1200
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:08,790
- No. - No, no.

1201
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:09,350
Xiumin, it's a picture
we took while eating.
- No. - No, no.

1202
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,830
Xiumin, it's a picture
we took while eating.

1203
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,280
Yayan, is it not taken well?
Xiumin, really hate it, it's true.

1204
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,140
- Is it true - Am I beautiful?
Yayan, is it not taken well?
Xiumin, really hate it, it's true.

1205
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:13,480
- Is it true - Am I beautiful?

1206
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:14,796
Yayan, I'm really
curious. I haven't seen it.

1207
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:17,536
Dongxu, did you not take it well?
Xiumin, I really want to delete it, really.

1208
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,686
Junrong, did you take it well?
Do you want me to help you delete it?

1209
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,770
Junrong, huh, it got snatched away.

1210
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:21,870
What are you doing?
Junrong, huh, it got snatched away.

1211
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:21,950
What are you doing?

1212
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,070
Yayan, delete it, delete it. Junrong,
teasing each other, teasing each other.

1213
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,180
Yayan: Isn't it interesting
to see others in love?

1214
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,960
Dongxu: Oh, be careful, be careful.

1215
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,210
Yayan: The rain is really heavy.

1216
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,040
Yayan: How are you feeling lately?

1217
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,166
Junrong: Oranges are really delicious...
You: Right hand.

1218
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:53,190
Yayan: Choose oranges, and then...

1219
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,060
Yayan: Are you tired?

1220
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,790
Junrong: No, it's just... I
just don't know what to do.

1221
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:07,290
Yayan, what's wrong?
What do you want to do?

1222
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,300
Junrong, I don't know. Note: The name
in the original text was mislabeled.

1223
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:17,350
Yayan, will you continue to stay?
In the dormitory? Headquarters?

1224
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:21,470
Yayan, is there anywhere you want
to go? Junrong, because it's raining.

1225
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:25,560
Yayan, why not take someone
indoors out for a trip?

1226
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,480
Junrong, kidnapping? Yayan, yeah.

1227
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,030
Yayan, come with me!

1228
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,980
Yayan, Liucheng, hehe.

1229
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:35,220
Junrong, with an orange in his mouth,
Yayan, running while hugging it (?).

1230
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,910
It must be funny, putting
the orange in front.

1231
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,520
Yayan, brother, don't you have one?

1232
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:47,770
Junrong, I don't know.

1233
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,230
Junrong, the others
all say they don't know.

1234
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,360
Yayan, hmm, brother, I
really don't understand.

1235
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,760
Yayan, who is your heart leaning towards?

1236
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,750
Dongxu, where are you
going? Huicheng: Outside.

1237
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,970
Xiumin, but brother, didn't you say you would help me
make brunch? Dongxu: Huicheng, where are you going?

1238
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:13,740
Huicheng, ah.
Xiumin, but brother, didn't you say you would help me
make brunch? Dongxu: Huicheng, where are you going?

1239
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,210
Huicheng, ah.

1240
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,876
Xiumin, you said you would
help me make brunch. Huicheng: Mm.

1241
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,420
Huicheng, come here! Are we going to
make it now? Xiumin: Mm, let's do it.

1242
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,420
Better not.
Huicheng, come here! Are we going to
make it now? Xiumin: Mm, let's do it.

1243
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:20,490
Huicheng, come here! Are we going to
make it now? Xiumin: Mm, let's do it.

1244
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,280
Mm.
What?
Huicheng, come here! Are we going to
make it now? Xiumin: Mm, let's do it.

1245
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:21,490
Mm.
What?

1246
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,396
Xiumin, sister, I'm going
to cook delicious food now.

1247
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,050
Yuli, should I do it now? Alright.

1248
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,860
Dongxu didn't wait in vain.

1249
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,030
Huicheng, show me! The phone.

1250
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,770
Xiumin, you have to do this.

1251
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,476
It looks like... Huicheng, do we have
all the ingredients? Xiumin, I don't know.

1252
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,750
Huicheng, come here.

1253
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,830
Huicheng takes out an avocado.
Okay.

1254
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:47,260
Xiumin But I don't know
which one is fully ripe.

1255
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,440
Huicheng Choose one that you like.

1256
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:01,530
Xiumin carefully selects an avocado.

1257
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:04,910
This one.

1258
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,370
Chuu Oh wow, so happy~!

1259
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:08,070
Zhenglie So adorable.
Exactly.

1260
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,070
Huicheng Um... you
seem pretty skilled, huh?

1261
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,570
Suimin, I consider myself
quite good at cooking.

1262
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:15,650
Really?

1263
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,396
Suimin, first, cheese and Frankfurt
hot dogs. Huicheng, cream, cream.

1264
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,976
Suimin, I've already taken out the cream.

1265
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,340
Suimin, and cheese...

1266
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,796
Suimin, what kind of cheese do we
need? Gouda cheese or Emmental cheese...

1267
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,190
Huicheng: We want to cook eggs...

1268
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,360
Xiumin: But we don't have any eggs.
Yes, that's right.

1269
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,040
Huicheng: What should we do...?

1270
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:33,170
Xiumin: It's not like I can make it
without eggs. I have to fry an egg.

1271
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,800
Xiumin: Ha... Why did I even
mention cooking for you tomorrow...

1272
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,980
Wait a moment.

1273
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,640
Zhenglie: Ah, he must be really annoyed.

1274
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,750
There are two feelings at the same time

1275
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,670
There are feelings that she is cute,
but I also feel very uncomfortable

1276
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,850
Shangxun, it's like breaking a sauce jar

1277
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,940
Shangxun, block here, but it leaks
there, it's been like this all along

1278
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,940
That's what I'm saying
Shangxun, block here, but it leaks
there, it's been like this all along

1279
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,110
Shangxun, block here, but it leaks
there, it's been like this all along

1280
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,750
JaeJae can't watch with a calm heart

1281
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,730
Xiumin, it's not... it's like this

1282
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,890
Xiumin, Sister Liyuan helped him make
fried rice yesterday, and he ate it happily

1283
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,496
Xiumin, I also want to make it for him to
eat, that's why I said I want to make it...

1284
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,049
Xiumin is too anxious.

1285
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:12,570
- Take out the bread.
Bread - Where is the bread?

1286
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,316
- The bread is there.
- It's alright, it's okay if there isn't any.

1287
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,020
Huicheng, no need for garlic. Just need salt
and pepper. It's fine, everything is ready now.

1288
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,020
Junrong walks towards Xiumin.

1289
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:32,130
Junrong, what are you doing... We've
just had breakfast not long ago, right?

1290
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:35,450
Junrong, do you want to do something?
Is it the thing made with avocado?

1291
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,060
Xiumin, a bit... very...! A bit of that.

1292
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,810
Finally, he left here.

1293
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,810
Eggs, eggs.
Finally, he left here.

1294
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:04,120
Finally, he left here.

1295
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,660
JaeJae, what should we do about Junrong...

1296
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:15,049
JaeJae, there are times when I
feel like I don't belong here...

1297
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,050
That's right.

1298
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,950
Yuli, oh, Yajin's friend. 民建 Hi!

1299
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,710
Huicheng: Brother, let's go.

1300
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,080
Xiumin: No, you have to help me with it.

1301
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,570
Xiumin: I can get the ingredients myself.

1302
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,180
Huicheng: Forget it, let's
just help up to here. I...

1303
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,740
Xiumin: No, didn't you
say you would help me?

1304
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,340
Huicheng: Then let's do
it later in the evening?

1305
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,756
Xiumin: No, he's probably hungry
now. That brother needs to gain weight.

1306
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:53,206
Xiumin, didn't you see what he looked like
wearing a vest yesterday? Huicheng: Dongxu, right?

1307
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:58,180
Huicheng: It would be great if you could do it together.
Xiumin: No! It only makes sense if I cook it for him.

1308
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,060
Huicheng hurriedly left.

1309
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,060
Left.
Huicheng hurriedly left.

1310
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,270
Huicheng hurriedly left.

1311
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,650
Xiumin: Can I make this? Dongxu: Yes.

1312
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,530
Xiumin: But there are no eggs.

1313
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,170
Dongxu: No eggs? It's okay.

1314
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,820
Xiumin, do you want to
go to the chicken farm?

1315
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,246
Xiumin, the biggest problem is...
your hairstyle looks a bit strange now.

1316
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,740
Dongxu: It's a ponytail.

1317
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:22,589
I like ponytails.

1318
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,590
So that's how it is.

1319
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Got it.

1320
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:35,050
Xiumin, Yayan sister, are you going
out? Can you help me with something?

1321
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,830
Yayan: I have to go out,
but I'll be right back.

1322
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,580
Xiǔmǐn, sister, don't go. Yǎyán,
you two help each other, hurry up.

1323
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,750
Yǎyán, well... help each other.

1324
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,659
Xiǔmǐn encountered difficulties.

1325
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:50,440
What should we do?

1326
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:54,560
Xiǔmǐn, does Mínjiàn know how
to cook? Dōngxù, he doesn't know.

1327
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,030
Xiǔmǐn, are you very hungry?
Dōngxù, I'm not hungry...

1328
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,650
Xiǔmǐn, then...

1329
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,770
Then...

1330
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,950
Then...

1331
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,690
Let's have dinner later,
Xiumin! Dongxu Sure, okay.

1332
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,950
Xiumin, I'll put these back.

1333
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,150
Dongxu Got it.

1334
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,750
Got it.

1335
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,610
Oh, it's so adorable!

1336
01:16:20,611 --> 01:16:22,500
Shangxun Dongxu changed his
clothes four times already.

1337
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,430
That's right, oh yeah, that's right.
Shangxun Dongxu changed his
clothes four times already.

1338
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:23,960
That's right, oh yeah, that's right.

1339
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:27,680
Dongxu Let's do it together.
Xiumin Oh, should we?

1340
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,660
Xiumin, I also want to... do the
same for you as Sister Liyuan...

1341
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:33,840
Dongxu has been hungry for 16 hours.

1342
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,350
- Hurry up and put it in. - Okay.
Dongxu has been hungry for 16 hours.

1343
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,350
Dongxu has been hungry for 16 hours.

1344
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:38,320
So, this one...
Dongxu has been hungry for 16 hours.

1345
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:38,650
So, this one...

1346
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,570
Yuli, have fun! Huicheng, goodbye~

1347
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,360
Goodbye.
Yuli, have fun! Huicheng, goodbye~

1348
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:41,790
Goodbye.

1349
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:43,520
Yayan, wow, look at this rain.

1350
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,820
Yayan, don't let the
umbrella get blown over...

1351
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,530
- Have you seen the car?
- Yes, I have. The color is so cute.

1352
01:16:49,531 --> 01:16:50,050
Yayan and Huicheng went on a date.

1353
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,500
- So cute! - Like ladybugs.
Yayan and Huicheng went on a date.

1354
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,000
Yayan and Huicheng went on a date.

1355
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,030
Junrong, why are you alone? Where is everyone
else? Xiumin, maybe they went on a date?

1356
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:09,570
Junrong, do you have
anything you want to do?

1357
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:14,350
Xiumin, I have many things I want
to do, but I can't do them here.

1358
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,750
Junrong, it's not appropriate to do anything,
but where did they go on their date?

1359
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,830
Xiumin seems to be going to the
bowling alley. Joon Young: Oh, really?

1360
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,720
Joon Young: I have also considered
going to the bowling alley.

1361
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:29,200
Xiumin: But I can't go
bowling because of my hand.

1362
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:33,610
Joon Young: I see. You have
to play the piano instead.

1363
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,900
Joon Young: I also want to
go out. Xiumin: Go out then.

1364
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,070
Joon Young: With who? Xiumin...

1365
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,980
Junrong, do you want
to accompany me outside?

1366
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:50,870
What should I do, Junrong...

1367
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,500
Junrong
What should I do, Junrong...

1368
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,130
What should I do, Junrong...

1369
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,920
Xiumin, when will Chengyun gege come back?

1370
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:58,660
Junrong, he should be back tomorrow.

1371
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:02,910
I'm leaving.

1372
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,590
Junrong left.

1373
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,360
Junrong, ouch... Minjian,
is gege doing well?

1374
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,710
Junrong, no... Can't you see that
I'm not comfortable staying here?

1375
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,910
Xiumin, you said you were searching for
places worth visiting. Did you find anything?

1376
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:50,260
Dongxu, yes, I searched.
Xiumin, did you find anything?

1377
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:54,070
Dongxu, they are all outdoors.

1378
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,179
You guys have switched!

1379
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:35,680
What are you doing?

1380
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:38,046
JaeJae, no matter what, if each
person is going to wear one side...

1381
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,476
JaeJae, I'll take the left
side, you take the right side.

1382
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,356
You should wear them like this if you have feelings
for each other. It should be worn like this, right?

1383
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,510
Zheng Lie, this... this...
is very creative, huh?

1384
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,959
You'll be able to face each other
if you wear it like this, though.

1385
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,660
That's right.

1386
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:49,100
Wow~~ Wuuu

1387
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,530
Zheng Lie, I thought Dong Xu didn't understand
anything, but it seems like he does.

1388
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,000
It seems like he does.
Zheng Lie, I thought Dong Xu didn't understand
anything, but it seems like he does.

1389
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,770
It seems like he does.

1390
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,390
Dong Xu, do you know this song?

1391
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,150
Dong Xu, I really want
to listen to it with you.

1392
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:31,309
Ouch ouch ouch!!

1393
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:31,550
So shy

1394
01:20:31,551 --> 01:20:33,511
JaeJae, at times like
this, my heart will explode

1395
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,320
- What is it? - What is it?

1396
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:28,620
Dongxu, this moment is very beautiful...
Should I say it's the unease of soon parting?

1397
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,320
Dongxu, felt these realities more cruelly

1398
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:37,070
Dongxu, but in the end...
still have to accept it

1399
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:05,260
Su-min, I'm Kim Su-min, 17
years old, majoring in piano

1400
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:09,710
Xiumin was originally studying at S Art School but
now she dropped out to prepare for studying aboard.

1401
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:14,610
Xiumin got accepted to university and is going to Germany.
Currently, she is practicing piano to prepare for an exam.

1402
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:22,960
Xiumin, to be honest, I never expected to
meet a friend of the opposite sex whom I like.

1403
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:27,980
Xiumin, even though I want to be together,
the reality is that I have to leave...

1404
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,630
Dongxu, I'll go out for a moment.

1405
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:55,810
Su-min: At most, I only go back
to Korea two or three times a year.

1406
01:22:55,870 --> 01:23:00,110
Su-min: I think my brother will find
it very difficult because of this...

1407
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,020
Yu-ri: What's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1408
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:08,210
Su-min: I feel really
sorry. Yu-ri: Sorry for what?

1409
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:12,110
Su-min: Wasn't I supposed
to go to Germany...

1410
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,470
Yu-ri: Are you feeling very sad?

1411
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,430
Yu-ri: It's true love after
all. What should Su-min do?

1412
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,110
Xiumin, I'm fine, but I feel really sorry.

1413
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:26,930
Yuli, Did you say that?
Is that how you feel?

1414
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:33,280
Yuli, There's no need to apologize. Going
abroad for your dreams is a good path for you...

1415
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,326
Yuli, It's not like we'll
never see each other again.

1416
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,500
Yuli, Let's just keep
in touch all the time.

1417
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,130
And now,

1418
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,400
Junrong: What happened to her? Did
she cut onions while making brunch?

1419
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,520
Yuli: Yes, she did cut onions.

1420
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,740
Junrong: What happened? What
happened? Xiumin: Exactly.

1421
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,010
Yuli: It's raining outside,
and tears are flowing.

1422
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,500
Junrong: Is it because I
left without saying anything?

1423
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,900
Junrong: I won't speculate anymore.

1424
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:04,130
Junrong: I will play the guitar
for you. Yuli: Play a happy tune...

1425
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:05,930
Junrong, what do you want to play?

1426
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,460
Xiumin, do you know Eric
Satie's "Naked Waltz"?

1427
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,850
Junrong, I will play Eric Satie's "Naked
Waltz" for you. Youli: Um, play that one.

1428
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,650
Youli: Oh, Eric Satie, right?

1429
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:19,740
Xiumin: No, that's "Three Little Bears."
Youli: This is Eric Satie's "Naked Waltz."

1430
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,720
Su Min, this is "Three Little Bears"!

1431
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,170
Yo Li, you can't fool Su Min.

1432
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,350
Yo Li, who is it really!

1433
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:30,980
It's Liu Dongxu!

1434
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,130
Our...
It's Liu Dongxu!

1435
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:32,160
It's Liu Dongxu!

1436
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,700
Why are you making them cry?
It's Liu Dongxu!

1437
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:33,750
Why are you making them cry?

1438
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:35,390
Yo Li, who made you cry!

1439
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,721
Su Min, it's Liu Dongxu. Yo
Li, Liu Dongxu? Good and bad.

1440
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,280
Jun Rong requested a
1:1 private conversation.

1441
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,840
Junrong, hello.

1442
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,670
The secret conversation is with Dongxu.

1443
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,750
Look, look.

1444
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,999
Chuu, what's going on?

1445
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,600
Junrong.

1446
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,930
Love is too intense... wait, wait, wait.

1447
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,370
JaeJae made her cry and angry.

1448
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,260
Dongxu, yes, bro...

1449
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,980
Xiumin, because I've never
liked someone so much before...

1450
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:37,200
Thank you very much for liking me.

1451
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:38,860
Dongxu is happy every day.

1452
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:42,840
Dongxu, thank you for letting me
experience this kind of feeling.

1453
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:45,191
Xiumin, I want to say something
but can't find the words.

1454
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:50,550
I will remember you as my first love.

1455
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,290
Junrong, sigh...

1456
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,886
Junrong, I called the person I
wanted to have a conversation with.

1457
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:56,960
Dongxu, do you still like her?

1458
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,640
Dongxu, I am getting
closer and closer to her.

1459
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,830
Junrong, I don't know...

1460
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,180
Do you want to go back?
Don't you want to go back?

1461
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,780
Huiran, go out with Huicheng
before your sister comes back.

1462
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:19,970
Yayan, hmm~

1463
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,580
Huicheng, the arm should be
placed towards the center like this.

1464
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,530
Yayan, the conversation
didn't break at all.

1465
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:27,280
But... I feel a little bit attracted?

1466
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,140
Yayan, so cute.

1467
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,060
It seems like I'm gradually falling.

1468
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,380
Yayan, I don't dare to
greet properly anymore.

1469
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,830
I pay a lot of attention
to my sister's expression.

1470
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:46,840
I don't know what to do.

1471
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:51,310
Yayan, what should I do... My
sister is back, what should I say?

1472
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,079
Liyuan, did you cry?

1473
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,080
Did I?

1474
01:28:56,370 --> 01:29:00,750
I feel a bit uncomfortable.
