1
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,999
Mungge~ Mungge~

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,713
Why are you so active?

3
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:23,914
Why are you so lively?

4
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,999
I think I slept really well yesterday,
I just passed out

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,487
Me too

6
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,176
It was amazing

7
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:45,965
Hello

8
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,627
She looks like Jang Won-young today

9
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:06,251
She's looked like her since yesterday

10
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:10,355
I was looking at the
sticker on the Blossom Diary,

11
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:12,661
There was someone who looked
exactly like Jang Won-young

12
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,458
She was like 'It didn't turn out well'

13
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:18,036
I wonder how much more
pretty she looks in good pics

14
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:31,150
Felix and Jang Won-young..!
Compliments are everywhere

15
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,847
Did they decide to date?

16
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:34,470
No, not yet

17
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:38,351
When Jun-young came in all fancy

18
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,433
Soo-min and Ah-yeon were sitting together,
right?

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,180
I usually call that a 'double-take'

20
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:44,976
Ohh~~

21
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,569
Soo-min was about to eat bread

22
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,337
You're saying she has feelings for him?

23
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:55,945
It's exactly a 'double-take'

24
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:59,098
They really can't hide
it... Isn't it so obvious?

25
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,353
They're very innocent,
as their age suggests

26
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:04,878
They are just the type to show it

27
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,022
Did you sleep well?

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,064
But I woke up because it was cold

29
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:57,688
- How's school life? - Huh? What?

30
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:00,437
School life?

31
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,287
It's fun

32
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,314
First grade?

33
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,702
Yes

34
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,825
Shall we go there too?

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,460
Want to switch? Want to switch?

36
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,198
I'll handle both

37
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,399
Alright, I'll take photos

38
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:48,786
- No wait a minute - Give me one

39
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,458
So pretty, honestly

40
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,410
Please look here

41
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,918
You're so tall, I have to do it like this

42
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,461
Hold up!

43
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:31,685
Mungge and Cloud are
doing their part very well

44
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,608
Keep getting it tangled for them

45
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,615
Let's stay like this until dinner

46
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,753
Yeah, sounds good

47
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,124
They're running

48
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,851
I'll take a photo for you

49
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,849
Please make it look natural

50
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,850
Both of you look like actors

51
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,825
I'm feeling hot, so I'll go inside first

52
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:36,508
You gonna water it? I think
the leaves were watered yesterday

53
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,104
Really?

54
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,971
Can I water this? Is
it an artificial flower?

55
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:44,196
Even if it's artificial, it might like it

56
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,396
There's soil, right

57
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,999
I was just trying to find common ground

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,606
Come to think of it, you were eighteen

59
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,000
Do I seem like your age when we talk?

60
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,200
Yeah

61
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,642
I kinda thought you were older

62
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,342
But there's no way you can be older than me

63
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,654
Same age

64
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,711
I don't seem young to you?

65
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,263
- No - Oh really?

66
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:11,051
When we first met, you spoke so well

67
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:13,660
So I thought you might be nineteen

68
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,991
But I thought everyone
would speak informally

69
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,025
Just call the name and just...

70
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:23,123
Like, "Ryeo-won" like this?

71
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:26,786
But it was so awkward
when you called me "nuna"

72
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm not called "Nuna"

73
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,767
Ryeo-won is starting to get annoyed

74
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:43,741
that Hye-sung keeps calling her "nuna"

75
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:46,910
Han Bin,
do you have anyone who you call "nuna"?

76
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,799
For someone I like, it's more like

77
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,701
"Hey" like this

78
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,637
Or teasingly talking in a
way that stiumulates curiosity

79
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:57,836
Like 'Hmm..what's with him?

80
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:00,479
So you're making them think of you

81
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,226
Emotions start from
thinking of them? Or no?

82
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:07,346
Right,
it starts with thinking about it and then

83
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,493
Feelings develop and emotions arise

84
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,678
Feelings develop and emotions arise

85
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,977
Oh~~

86
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,384
- We walked around the
neighborhood - I know, right

87
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,210
Hi

88
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:24,955
Wow, he's really tall

89
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,673
Do you want me to hold your bag? It's heavy

90
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,777
It's not heavy, it's fine

91
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:33,582
But Jun-young really looks
like a celebrity, right?

92
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,018
When I meet him outside,
I think I'll be like woah!

93
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,347
He must be popular in school, right?

94
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:39,548
You too

95
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,133
Shall we go to the lounge?

96
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:42,930
Yes, let's

97
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,501
I'm hungry

98
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:49,587
Are you hungry?

99
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:52,553
Shall we make bread? Do you eat bread?

100
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,178
Do you like cream
cheese? Or do you like jam?

101
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,955
What do you like?

102
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,092
I like cream cheese

103
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,693
Then let's have cream cheese

104
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,909
This has to be moist to be delicious

105
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:14,190
I really like heavy stuff

106
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,291
So that's why you like pasta

107
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,192
It has to be greasy

108
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,467
Ah, so this is what it tastes like

109
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,511
I can't figure out Hye-sung's major

110
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:33,141
No matter how I look...
he's in physical education

111
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,402
I should prepare for the PE entrance exam

112
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,970
PE SCHOOL

113
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,766
Doesn't he look like he
might play tennis a bit?

114
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,257
Tennis?

115
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:41,050
Golf, golf

116
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,844
I think ballet or something

117
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:45,845
Ballet, definitely ballet

118
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,147
How exciting!

119
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,570
A one-day class?

120
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:07,718
Huh?

121
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,974
I can hear the piano

122
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:11,991
Is it played well?

123
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,326
Yes, it's played wel;

124
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,222
Surprisingly,
Soo-min might be majoring in piano

125
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,110
She plays the piano?

126
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,191
A present came

127
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,242
What's in it?

128
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,783
We should go and open it

129
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,860
What could it be?

130
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,104
I'll open it

131
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,677
What's this?

132
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,122
We're picking a doll

133
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,510
Majors

134
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:00,311
What we want to learn

135
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,925
After guessing the major, choose a keyring,
then go to the location indicated on the map

136
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:18,197
There are ballet, piano,
art, and vocal lessons

137
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,899
Oh, this will be fun

138
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,644
Oh, this feels exciting

139
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,052
So, this is how they reveal the majors

140
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,843
One-on-one lessons?

141
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,260
This is driving me crazy

142
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,537
But this is really awesome

143
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:33,254
Ryeo-won might be into musicals and such

144
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,792
Yes, it's possible

145
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,941
Yu-ri might be majoring in singing

146
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,129
Breathe in California's fresh air

147
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,891
Sing Adele for an entrance exam

148
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,745
It could be like a random Big Mama song

149
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:54,155
Wanting to learn vocals

150
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:56,186
doesn't mean they want to learn it for real

151
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:57,013
They have to guess...

152
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:59,568
and go to the girl they want

153
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,992
What major class are you gonna do?

154
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:11,634
What do you want to do?

155
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,226
This keyring is so cute, isn't it?

156
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,078
I want to try piano

157
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll try drawing

158
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,204
I wonder who majors in piano
I have no idea with this one

159
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,810
- Ryeo-won? - You think Ryeo-won?

160
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,348
I feel like Ryeo-won would be arts...

161
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,925
I think she might be at the drawing place

162
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,348
- Soo-min? - Yeah

163
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:02,923
I think Soo-min might be majoring in art

164
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:04,821
If we have a one-on-one lesson,

165
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:07,722
I thought we could become closer

166
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:23,561
I felt that Soo-min
might be majoring in piano

167
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,563
I chose the piano because I was interested

168
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:16,972
- Hello - Hi

169
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,824
Hi

170
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,082
It was piano

171
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,683
My major is piano

172
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,716
Oh? What's this?

173
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:32,279
It's cute hey

174
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Is it for me?
Yes

175
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,623
So... piano was your major

176
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:42,400
It's cool

177
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,566
The corners of his mouth went up like this

178
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,424
Look at him smile

179
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:53,124
Wow, he really likes it

180
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:54,909
It was piano

181
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,808
She really suits it

182
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:06,701
I was attending S High School,
then dropped out

183
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:13,757
I passed a uni exam in Germany
so I'm gonna go study there soon

184
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,869
So, I'm not attending school now

185
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,648
I'll play a short piece

186
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:48,538
I'm nervous

187
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:49,773
I'll stop here

188
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,705
Wow~

189
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,150
Thank you

190
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,350
Look at him

191
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:57,534
He's so fallen for her

192
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,135
Honey is dripping from his eyes

193
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,337
I feel bad for listening

194
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,420
Why?

195
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:05,474
I'm so happy you're here

196
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:09,399
I'm so happy you're here

197
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:14,810
Sit here

198
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,862
Yes, teacher

199
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:19,373
Please have a seat here

200
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,235
I have to teach this to you

201
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,542
"Three Bears"

202
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,806
Do you know the scale names?

203
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:37,807
It's sol, sol!

204
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,040
Show me how

205
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,903
The left hand is difficult

206
00:17:56,904 --> 00:18:00,639
I'll play with my left hand,
you play with your right

207
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:22,497
What?!

208
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:24,396
What? Don't play with us Dong-wook

209
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,729
Huh???!

210
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:37,032
Dong-wook plays the piano really well

211
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,931
but I prepared

212
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:44,001
He pretended it was
difficult and was considerate

213
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,549
so I was touched by that

214
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,703
So, she felt it was considerate

215
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:03,448
They can get moved by that

216
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:05,219
If it was me... I'd be like

217
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:06,120
Huh?

218
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,150
You think I'm easy?

219
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:10,018
I'd wait until they get it wrong

220
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,477
and grab their wrists

221
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:16,576
and be like 'Who you foolin?'

222
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,116
We must be weird

223
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,397
Yeah we're not innocent like that

224
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,553
So that feels considerate?

225
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:24,924
Guess she can be touched by that

226
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,414
Yeah you should!

227
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,159
Did you choose this?

228
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,832
Yeah

229
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,520
Who did you think would play the piano?

230
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:34,551
You thought it'd be me?

231
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,504
I felt like it would be you

232
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:42,566
I somehow had the image of you playing

233
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,005
Did well, right?

234
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:46,405
Yeah

235
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,510
What's your major?

236
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:54,177
What do you think?

237
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:55,260
Acting?

238
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,643
Right

239
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:58,140
Really?

240
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,203
Yeah, I'm acting

241
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,804
Oh, I thought you might be acting

242
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,832
Wow, that's amazing So
you'll become an actor later?

243
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:20,268
Want to take a photo? Shall we go now?

244
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,381
Yes

245
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,667
But, can I quickly stop by the dormitory?

246
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:29,363
Yes

247
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:31,032
Can you wait for about 2 minutes?

248
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:32,507
Sure, I got it

249
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:48,899
Let's go

250
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,256
Guess what I did

251
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:52,287
What did you do?

252
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:54,287
I put on some lipstick

253
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:57,563
I wanted to look pretty

254
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,411
You're pretty even without it

255
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,250
Pretty without it?

256
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Hey, Dong-wook, slow down a bit

257
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,232
This is a big problem

258
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,860
There's no hard to get between them

259
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:12,831
Exactly, it feels so innocent

260
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:28,066
Playing the piano

261
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,067
Like this?

262
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:05,958
Of course, it's Hye-sung.. it's Hye-sung

263
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:17,416
He was the only one

264
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,667
that remembered my name

265
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:21,862
I wish he was more proactive

266
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,101
Hello

267
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:46,968
Hi

268
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,937
Hello

269
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,075
Unexpectedly

270
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,711
This keyring...

271
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,977
I'll show you first

272
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,845
Oh, I feel embarrassed

273
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,596
I expected it

274
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:10,302
I thought she would major in dance

275
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:13,834
I thought it was cool,
and I was quite surprised

276
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:49,752
It's cool.. I feel like
I could never do that

277
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:52,810
Are you flexible?

278
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:54,586
No, hahaha

279
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:56,433
You said you like sports

280
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:59,249
I like sports, but I'm not flexible

281
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,097
Sit?

282
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,710
Yes, like this, with legs straight

283
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:07,491
For ballet,
there are two main foot positions

284
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:10,025
Point, and flex

285
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,248
Point

286
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,483
Flex

287
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:14,565
Point

288
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:15,800
Flex

289
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:17,001
Point

290
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,336
- And then - Yes

291
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,818
About a fist space

292
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,324
En Vase and En Avant

293
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:28,637
Ab..ab?

294
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:29,721
En Avant

295
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:32,375
En Haut is above the head

296
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:37,470
- It doesn't go up - Not till the end...

297
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:38,870
No, it's not going up

298
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,671
- Um... - What's wrong with me..this?

299
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:42,725
Okay, then do that and

300
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:45,388
The extending move is called Al la second

301
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:53,602
You must be hot, what to do?

302
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:55,603
I feel bad now

303
00:25:56,444 --> 00:26:00,847
It's okay, I love working out so

304
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:02,748
I can put up with this

305
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:10,757
Now, let's try moving the leg to the side

306
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:12,858
Just a moment, hahaha

307
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:17,611
LOL Done

308
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:19,092
That's enough

309
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:20,680
Good?

310
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:28,929
Ever seen a ballet performance?

311
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,530
- My younger sister learned it
for a bit - Oh really? Younger?

312
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:37,440
It looked tough, and they had to
take intensive care of their body

313
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:43,065
Strength and everything in
general is really important

314
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:51,794
I went to the Basel Ballet School in Switzerland
when I was in the 7th grade for about 2 years

315
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:19,379
Went to Switzerland,
I got injured and faced a slump

316
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,680
Took a break and then went back to it

317
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,667
That sounds really tough

318
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:29,108
So..

319
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:32,567
What do you think I do?

320
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,908
You?

321
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,685
Maybe singing?

322
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:37,429
Singing?

323
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,659
Acting?

324
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:43,009
Piano

325
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:46,135
Really? I couldn't have guessed

326
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:48,422
Piano...?

327
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:50,445
That's a total surprise

328
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:53,364
He plays the piano with
those pot lid-like hands?

329
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,766
Pot lid-like hands?

330
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,562
Because Hye-sung is well built

331
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:58,496
Seeing and hearing it, he actually suits it

332
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:00,801
He does have the face of a genius pianist

333
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:04,788
Wow, I need to see this,
I can't imagine it yet

334
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:06,360
Hi

335
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:07,902
Hello

336
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,265
- It's a gift - What's this?

337
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,525
Can I sit?

338
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:20,963
Yeah, you can sit

339
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:25,259
Aren't the others coming?

340
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,911
No, just me

341
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:35,603
I major in traditional Korean painting

342
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:38,863
Traditional Korean painting

343
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:09,443
Let's draw each other

344
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:12,810
Sure, I can do that

345
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:18,042
You kind of look like a model major

346
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:20,864
That's my actual major

347
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:22,048
For real?

348
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,049
Yeah Really?

349
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,740
I knew it

350
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:33,706
I've always loved dressing up and
adorning myself since I was young

351
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:37,187
So, modeling felt just right for me

352
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:44,210
I first encountered a model competition
in my second year of high school

353
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:47,451
And I've been working hard
at it ever since through that

354
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,902
You usually do this

355
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,663
Right right,
you have to get the proportions

356
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:05,369
Your double eyelids are pretty

357
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:13,238
Highlighting the right points is important

358
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:17,159
I think your lips are a real highlight

359
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:21,550
That's great,
you can just make the lips red if you want

360
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:24,088
Okay, I'll just outline them

361
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,624
Your teeth look a bit cracked,
but no, they're lips

362
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,185
If I say they're lips,
then they're lips, right?

363
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:34,930
It's up to the artist

364
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,319
Right

365
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:45,734
Ah, I haven't played much lately

366
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:47,658
Should I just play the highlights?

367
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,222
I'm curious about Hye-sung

368
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,464
Yeah, I'm curious

369
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:56,166
Wow

370
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,861
Wait and see

371
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,359
My hands are a bit stiff right now

372
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,206
Wow, that's cool

373
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:48,002
I'll show you properly later

374
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:49,035
Sounds good

375
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:50,324
You're already so good at it

376
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,763
I didn't play much yesterday

377
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:53,458
You're so good

378
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:58,588
Ah-yeon seems to be showing some interest,
right?

379
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:00,364
Yes, I kind of felt that too

380
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:05,170
Because there's nothing
as striking as the piano

381
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:06,769
Its sound is so strong

382
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:08,863
It's cool

383
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:10,563
You're much cooler

384
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,635
Should I teach you now?

385
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:18,043
I'm really bad at it

386
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:19,227
I know how to play Chopsticks

387
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,023
Sit, I'll do it for you

388
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,223
They've labeled the notes

389
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:27,515
Do you know all these? This is Do sharp

390
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,758
Above Do is Do sharp

391
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,758
Above Re is Re sharp

392
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,035
There's no sharp here

393
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:39,731
Like this

394
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,221
Look, my hand isn't moving

395
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:44,344
Your hand shouldn't bend like this

396
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:50,121
In dance,
you need to stand straight just like that

397
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:55,302
Oh, it's starting, it's starting

398
00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:56,843
The angle is really... wow

399
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,103
The angle says everything

400
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:02,489
Am I drooling too much?

401
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,190
Touched once, once!

402
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:12,556
In dance,
you need to stand straight just like that

403
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:21,548
Try pressing it a bit more

404
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:22,549
Right

405
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:24,504
Can you play this?

406
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:25,534
I totally can

407
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:26,535
Try it

408
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:28,660
- From here - Got it

409
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:39,829
But you have to press this five times

410
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,810
One, two, three, four

411
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,011
Oh really? Isn't it six times?

412
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,705
I pressed it seven times

413
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:54,653
Anyway, this is how you play it

414
00:33:54,654 --> 00:33:56,449
When the time comes to teach you again

415
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,765
Great, properly then!

416
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:58,886
I'll teach you properly then

417
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:07,678
Thank you

418
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:09,701
What's this? What happened?

419
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:10,427
Keyring

420
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:12,453
Did you pick this out?

421
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:14,301
Yep, I did

422
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,588
It's time to tell you about my major

423
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:21,180
I'm in vocals

424
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,181
Vocals, right?

425
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:29,482
I've worked with producers
in the US and made demos

426
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,810
I've worked with producers
like Alfred hole in Korea

427
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:35,555
and producer heventseenyou

428
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:40,137
They create beats and I
add the melody and lyrics...

429
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:42,607
Basically, I create the top line

430
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:56,350
I'll give you a sneak peek
of the song I'm working on

431
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:57,585
But it's not finished yet

432
00:34:57,586 --> 00:34:59,684
Just the vibe

433
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,487
Wow

434
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,015
It's still a bit...

435
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,164
You're so good

436
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,552
This is the vibe

437
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:40,521
What kind of vibe do
you think this song has?

438
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:41,526
This one?

439
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,090
Should I say it feels dreamy?

440
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:45,784
That's right

441
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:46,968
It feels somewhat ethereal

442
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,989
Ethereal? I think so too

443
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,828
Oh? I know

444
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,890
I like old movies from the 70s,
80s? 80s, 90s

445
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:02,607
isn't an old movie

446
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,330
It's a recent film

447
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,687
Old movies are like

448
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:08,432
He went a bit far

449
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,229
was shot digitally

450
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,160
Look at this boy...

451
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:14,635
What about your major?

452
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:16,951
I... am studying acting

453
00:36:16,952 --> 00:36:18,625
You're an acting major?

454
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,542
So that's why you like movies

455
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:24,039
That's so fascinating

456
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,857
I kind of expected you to come in

457
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:41,548
How do you feel now that I've come?

458
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,390
I was nervous You were nervous?

459
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:45,059
Yeah

460
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,456
You might be on TV later then

461
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,201
I think you'd appear too

462
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:53,864
A world-renowned pianist

463
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,793
Kim Soo-min...

464
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:57,672
Aren't you praising too much?

465
00:36:58,072 --> 00:36:59,561
Give me an autograph later

466
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:01,511
You give me one too

467
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:04,185
Do you have any questions?

468
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:06,363
Ask anything

469
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:08,241
I'll answer it all

470
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:10,416
Then, what's your ideal type?

471
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:13,111
I like someone with an aura

472
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:15,903
But to have an aura,
you have to be pretty, right?

473
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:21,477
Even if they're not objectively pretty,

474
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:25,264
There's certain impressions
that can give off an aura

475
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,431
You are pretty

476
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,432
And you have that aura

477
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:36,615
Dong-wook!!!

478
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,831
T's over, it's over

479
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,897
Please go a bit slower

480
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:43,775
I'm feeling carsick now

481
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:47,620
Buckle up, we're going fast

482
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:49,468
Can't we order chicken? Honestly?

483
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,029
I feel I should drink beer

484
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,544
I can't watch this sitting still

485
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:58,813
Let's wear motion
sickness patches next time

486
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:03,454
You are pretty

487
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,455
And you have that aura

488
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:16,107
I feel like we shouldn't
have interrupted this mood

489
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,597
You're handsome too

490
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,699
You make me feel shy saying that

491
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,500
-You make me feel shy saying
that -I'm feeling pretty embarrassed

492
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,340
I thought I was watching a real performance

493
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,611
- For real - As if

494
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:34,917
- Where am I - I still
have a long way to go

495
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:40,592
- Where am I -Being too close made me shy

496
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:45,189
I thought I was at a
completely different place

497
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,718
You played the piano so well

498
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,051
Piano?

499
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,851
I got it all wrong earlier

500
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:53,852
I should have shown you properly

501
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:58,310
What did you say your ideal type was?

502
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:01,310
Me? I've always been attracted

503
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:05,011
to someone who's affectionate and funny

504
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,511
But the person I'm attracted
to changes every time

505
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,212
I like making people laugh

506
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:11,810
Making them laugh?

507
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:16,212
I like it when people
react amusingly to what I say

508
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,011
I enjoy making them laugh for that reason

509
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:23,111
Do you prefer a relationship like friends?

510
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:26,733
Or do you always like the thrill?

511
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:31,756
Honestly,
I don’t think I can be in a relationship

512
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:35,457
if it’s too much like friendship

513
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:39,474
- Is it not good if it’s too comfortable?
- You can't really be like real friends

514
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:42,407
Am I a bit conservative?

515
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:02,168
I think Jun-young will bring a painting

516
00:40:05,274 --> 00:40:06,512
Hello

517
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:10,909
Welcome back

518
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:14,123
The owner?
Soo-min

519
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:21,544
Oh, you guys took two photos

520
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,746
How did yours turn out?

521
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:26,511
Ours turned out great

522
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:28,892
She said she didn't know how to take it

523
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,960
I looked bad, but he kept looking amazing

524
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:36,926
Show us

525
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:37,733
Should we?

526
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:39,937
It doesn’t matter

527
00:40:42,538 --> 00:40:43,945
You guys look cute

528
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,732
It turned out so well

529
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:58,229
Let's take it again on our last day

530
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,629
We can take it every day

531
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:11,081
What's that?

532
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:16,554
This? Snacks! Want some snacks?

533
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:29,337
Sure, let's talk

534
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:31,843
So you attended the first
year and now you've dropped out?

535
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:34,866
I dropped out in my first year
and now I'm going to college

536
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,044
Germany..!

537
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:39,354
Germany is famous for music

538
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,246
I'll go check

539
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,682
Huh? Oh~

540
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,765
This was here

541
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,266
What’s this?

542
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:07,645
-Why do I feel excited? -Open it, open it

543
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:09,519
The box is all pink

544
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:12,241
What is it?

545
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:13,481
-What's this? -What?

546
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:15,012
Hold on

547
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:17,311
-Maybe it's that for
us too -Is it for a date?

548
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:19,209
Choose! Something like that

549
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,933
-Show us -Show us~

550
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:22,338
Is it a snack?

551
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,372
It's cute

552
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:29,712
Please read

553
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,692
Choose a keyring And gift it to one boy

554
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:39,023
It’s cute, should we choose?

555
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:43,217
I'll take the pink one

556
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:46,312
I’ll take the one with sunglasses

557
00:42:46,512 --> 00:42:48,845
Can I do this?

558
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:57,877
On what basis should we choose?

559
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,070
The one...

560
00:42:59,071 --> 00:43:01,121
The person you're most drawn to

561
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:04,022
Do you all have someone
that makes you go Oooh!

562
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:07,211
I’m curious about Soo-min

563
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:09,187
I'm curious about Ah-yeon

564
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:12,049
Here, take it

565
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:16,012
You take mine too

566
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,975
When should we give it?
Should we give it secretly?

567
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:23,026
We can't make it so obvious like... hey!

568
00:43:23,027 --> 00:43:24,393
Give it while eating

569
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,252
It's my gift

570
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:26,924
Accept my love

571
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:27,760
-Let's give it secretly -Yes

572
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:30,745
Call one by one or when you meet

573
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:32,811
Come here

574
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,174
We should aim for when they're alone

575
00:43:37,175 --> 00:43:39,568
When you just bump into each other

576
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:42,475
-Did you ever change your mind? -Me?

577
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,565
A little?

578
00:43:49,946 --> 00:43:52,306
A bit?

579
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:53,790
What about you?

580
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:56,345
It's the same for me

581
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:58,304
But there could be overlaps

582
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,005
Exactly

583
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,792
What about Hye-sung?

584
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:22,603
Hye-sung is probably washing up

585
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:25,857
I need him

586
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:32,320
Ah? You're here, my savior

587
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,912
Let's make seafood pancakes

588
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:34,913
Seafood pancakes

589
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:38,702
- There’s kimchi too, kimchi stew?
- Shall we try?

590
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:43,251
Learn!

591
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:49,318
Learn and cook for your
furture GF..She will like it

592
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,161
Should I add a little kimchi?

593
00:44:54,245 --> 00:44:55,888
Sorry

594
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:07,718
Oh, what's this?

595
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:09,141
Hello

596
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:15,403
hahaha lol

597
00:45:15,404 --> 00:45:17,047
It's a gift!

598
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:44,440
You're nervous right?

599
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,625
No, it looks delicious

600
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:52,912
Thank you for the meal

601
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:02,175
Isn't it romantic?

602
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,411
Sound of rain

603
00:46:53,174 --> 00:46:56,245
- Wow, what's up with him?
- It looks like an editorial shoot

604
00:46:57,654 --> 00:46:59,908
-Dude -It's like a photoshoot

605
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:01,602
Sentimental

606
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:02,703
Totally a photoshoot

607
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,118
The specialist has arrived

608
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,044
I'm tired right now, from doing the dishes

609
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:16,534
I'm so tired right now

610
00:47:16,535 --> 00:47:17,799
I'll do it tomorrow

611
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,341
I'm tired from the dishes

612
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:22,544
Dong-wook and I did

613
00:47:22,545 --> 00:47:25,345
is good

614
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:35,244
Pay attention to me,
I've put so many stickers here

615
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:37,527
I'll try playing this score

616
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:01,690
Actually, I can play more,
but I can't remember

617
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:04,191
- Your fingers are all...
- I really like this song

618
00:48:04,694 --> 00:48:06,245
I'll bring my phone

619
00:48:06,545 --> 00:48:10,012
While fetching her phone,
I'm gonna steal her spot

620
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:21,966
You're really pretty

621
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:30,362
Are you filming me? I'm shy

622
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:53,654
What are you doing?

623
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:57,894
Tying hair, haha

624
00:48:58,094 --> 00:48:59,583
Who says it like that?

625
00:48:59,584 --> 00:49:01,584
Thinking about how to tie my hair

626
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:04,852
Do you know how to thread?

627
00:49:04,853 --> 00:49:05,853
No

628
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,715
Grab and one two three four

629
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,942
Your hands are really small

630
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:35,036
I think there was this too

631
00:49:38,734 --> 00:49:40,329
Done

632
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,034
How do I do this?

633
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:45,421
Grab the two ends and lift up

634
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:49,685
You grab my hand like this

635
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,114
Hello

636
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,715
I was playing without minding, but

637
00:50:53,044 --> 00:50:54,074
Just play, I've heard it already

638
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:56,483
Is the noise okay?

639
00:50:57,113 --> 00:51:00,113
-I came coz I wanted to
hear Hye-sung play -Really?

640
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:02,351
Let's do a song together

641
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:03,911
Together?

642
00:51:03,912 --> 00:51:05,259
Do you have something you want?

643
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,020
What are you comfortable with?

644
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,272
Try it

645
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:13,993
There was this one I played a while ago...

646
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:19,221
Okay

647
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,685
That's really cool

648
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:51,804
This is crazy

649
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,421
-It's really cool -It's cool

650
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,523
That was good

651
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:07,883
It's really cool

652
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:09,711
So cool

653
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:12,217
They are playing without rehearsing this,
right?

654
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,609
Wow

655
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,644
Art schools are different

656
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:17,690
They can do it on the spot like this

657
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:21,762
Who are you going to give it to?

658
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,435
I think I know

659
00:52:23,436 --> 00:52:24,823
Me?

660
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:26,944
Where I'm looking at now

661
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:27,925
Tne one holding the stand now

662
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:29,573
I'm getting sleepy

663
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:30,554
I'm right, right?

664
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:32,554
I don't know

665
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:20,318
Sung-yoon

666
00:53:32,346 --> 00:53:33,891
This is a keyring

667
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:36,613
-Oh,
you figured out my major -Want to take it?

668
00:53:37,069 --> 00:53:40,946
Point, flex

669
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:43,877
Should I say I opened up more?

670
00:53:43,878 --> 00:53:45,878
I want to get to know him

671
00:53:51,172 --> 00:53:54,072
Sung-yoon

672
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:57,179
I think I was waiting
for him inside my heart

673
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,141
I think I would've looked
forward for him to come

674
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:20,924
You're gonna play? Want me to play?

675
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,924
What can you play? Oh you major in it

676
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:26,724
Yeah... You're not used to it yet?

677
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:28,025
Yeah

678
00:54:35,144 --> 00:54:37,343
- I know how to play it - Huh?

679
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:39,644
- I know how to play it - This?

680
00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:44,918
You want me to play?

681
00:54:54,897 --> 00:54:59,197
When did you start learning piano?

682
00:55:00,436 --> 00:55:03,736
I don't know... Oh maybe this isn't it

683
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:06,505
- Si - Oh, it's Si?

684
00:55:06,506 --> 00:55:08,705
This and left mi..!

685
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,306
- It's Mi? - Yeah

686
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,148
- I don't wanna play - Are you nervous?

687
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:18,049
Not in front of a majoring student

688
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,525
It's fun

689
00:55:56,892 --> 00:56:00,492
- I caught a live bunny - That's so cruel

690
00:56:05,092 --> 00:56:07,291
What are you doing Jun-young?

691
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:09,891
What chu doing?

692
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:12,991
Why are you catching the
bunnies? It's not yours

693
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:15,692
Why are you capturing their hearts?

694
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,032
Where are you going?
Dunno, you?

695
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:34,692
I'm going to the bathroom

696
00:56:36,331 --> 00:56:37,930
Here, it's a gift

697
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:39,130
For me?

698
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:40,330
- Who's is it? - It's mine

699
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:41,930
Really? Did you always have it?

700
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,231
Yeah I picked it

701
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:47,641
Wow, thanks

702
00:56:48,944 --> 00:56:50,384
See you later

703
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:33,585
- What got on it? - I think Kimchi Stew

704
00:57:38,894 --> 00:57:41,794
You need to give it a bath

705
00:57:50,873 --> 00:57:52,772
My heart warms up

706
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:55,473
What is with this Kimchi Stew?

707
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:24,204
Huh? He's not here

708
00:58:38,187 --> 00:58:40,187
Is he not here?

709
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,900
Where is he?

710
00:58:57,906 --> 00:59:00,706
Who's there?

711
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,748
Why are you running away?

712
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:11,748
She turned away!

713
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,949
No, before someone comes

714
00:59:14,456 --> 00:59:17,256
Who is that?

715
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:19,592
Hello!

716
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:21,192
You're here to look for us right?

717
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:24,093
- Where are you going? - To the dorm

718
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:36,240
- Who is that? - Rye-won

719
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,940
Where are you going?

720
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:40,840
What are you doing?

721
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:42,541
Catch her

722
00:59:44,486 --> 00:59:46,885
Where is she going?

723
00:59:46,886 --> 00:59:51,185
She just went by when I asked

724
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:54,085
Where an earth are you going?

725
00:59:54,086 --> 00:59:56,286
There's just something... LOL

726
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:01,400
There's nobbody in the boy's dorm right?

727
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,400
You were trying to go in!

728
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,000
Oh, I see

729
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,901
Did you see?

730
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,679
I have to give it to
him... what should I do?

731
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,779
Where's Sung-yoon?

732
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:22,279
I need to ask something

733
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,479
Are you going for Dong-wook?

734
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,179
- Who are you going for? - What about you?

735
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,980
- Jun-young? - No, Sung-yoon

736
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,979
- I dunnno - Hold up come here

737
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,880
Hold up... why?

738
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:44,377
I dunno

739
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:49,978
- Oh gosh,
I had absolutely no idea - For real?

740
01:00:50,886 --> 01:00:53,686
Hold up, come here!!!

741
01:00:57,525 --> 01:00:59,245
Where is he though?

01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:07,227
- Who's that? - Guys!

743
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:11,327
Can you find Sung-yoon
and get him to come here?

744
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:13,328
- Bring Sung-yoon.. - Where is he?

745
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:23,948
I'll say you're over there,
you look for him

746
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:28,048
- Is Sung-yoon here? - Not here

747
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:29,448
Where did he go?

748
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:30,748
- No? - Not here

749
01:01:30,749 --> 01:01:33,748
- Big trouble - Let's find him first

750
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:36,848
- He might be sleeping in the
lounge - That could be the case

751
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:40,248
Are you here? He's not

752
01:01:40,249 --> 01:01:42,249
Where did he go

753
01:01:46,775 --> 01:01:47,775
I'm here

754
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:51,844
Bark if you were bored

755
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:03,588
I'll teach you

756
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:21,773
After relaxing the whole arm

757
01:02:21,774 --> 01:02:23,573
When are you guys going home?

758
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:28,273
Do we have to? We wanna
hang out for a long time

759
01:02:28,274 --> 01:02:30,273
Ok...

760
01:02:30,274 --> 01:02:31,873
- What is she doing? - Let's go

761
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,873
Just play the piano

762
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:35,473
- Can we? - Yes

763
01:02:35,474 --> 01:02:37,873
- Something must be going on - Yeah,
for real

764
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:40,074
Come again, I'll teach you

765
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:44,673
He is so clueless..Hye-sung

766
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:47,874
If someone is being so
suspicious like that...

767
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:50,703
She is so cute

768
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:53,038
- Did you give it? - No

769
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,438
- Quickly do something - I just can't do it

770
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,738
- Is he there? - I dunno

771
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:01,638
- The guys aren't going around - I know

772
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:03,938
Who are you trying to
give it to? Are they here?

773
01:03:03,939 --> 01:03:05,338
Will you tell if I tell?

774
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:06,438
- Is yours here? - No, not here

775
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:08,439
Mine is here

776
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,299
It looks as if I'm so desparate

777
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,600
They must be in love,
they're not staying apart

778
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:31,398
Are they done?

779
01:03:34,149 --> 01:03:35,349
They're not done

780
01:03:40,288 --> 01:03:41,887
I have an idea

781
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:44,587
"Can you see if Sang-yoon is sleeping?"

782
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,788
We go together and let him come out

783
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:54,764
I want to give it secretly

784
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:57,264
On his way home

785
01:03:57,265 --> 01:03:59,764
But itsn't that a bit
weird? If he's with someone

786
01:03:59,765 --> 01:04:01,964
That's right

787
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:04,765
I'll try figuring it out

788
01:04:12,232 --> 01:04:14,231
I seem like a stalker, right?

789
01:04:14,232 --> 01:04:16,131
Do you have business? I'll help

790
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:18,632
- What can I do for you?
- There's no such thing

791
01:04:29,337 --> 01:04:30,836
When are you guys gonna wash up?

792
01:04:30,837 --> 01:04:32,136
When?

793
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:33,836
When are you going to the dorm to wash up?

794
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:36,136
She wants us to go in, right?

795
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,937
- The girls must be up to
something - Let's go in now

796
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:41,513
There must be something,
we were so clueless

797
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:44,114
Something was going on

798
01:04:49,424 --> 01:04:50,723
Why is she going there now?

799
01:04:50,724 --> 01:04:52,224
Let's follow her

800
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:55,894
Why are you guys in pairs?

801
01:04:55,895 --> 01:04:59,094
- Do we need to be separated?
- It's just how it's been

802
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:03,295
- You're going back home?
- That's what you told us

803
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:12,372
NOOO...

804
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:20,482
Um... How do I ring the bell?

805
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:24,388
It's this... Is it not?

806
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:25,588
You can hear it inside

807
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,589
You can just knock on the door

808
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:33,533
Can you hear?

809
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,770
Can't you just do this?

810
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:38,839
Here!

811
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,109
Huh?

812
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,919
What is this?

813
01:05:57,225 --> 01:06:00,224
- Did you give the keyring? - Yeah

814
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:01,924
- Did you give it to him? - Yeah

815
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,724
- Where? - This makes you nervous

816
01:06:04,725 --> 01:06:08,425
I just gave it to him and ran

817
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:10,736
I just ran way

818
01:06:10,737 --> 01:06:12,937
Because I was so shy

819
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:25,718
He's not here

820
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:27,418
He's gone to write the diary

821
01:06:27,419 --> 01:06:28,918
I can't see Sung-yoon too

822
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:31,818
- Should we just wash up? - Yeah

823
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:34,119
I'm gonna go to the bathroom

824
01:07:06,586 --> 01:07:14,085
I remember Ryeo-won saying
that I don't seem younger than her

825
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:16,085
I don't seem younger than you?

826
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:18,385
- Yeah like maybe same age? - Oh really?

827
01:07:18,386 --> 01:07:21,785
- Do you like cream cheese? Or Jam?
- What do you like?

828
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:24,186
- I like cream cheese -
Then let's go with that

829
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,379
I think I felt closer to
her than the anyone else

830
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,080
We talked a lot too

831
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,280
Kinda liked that!

832
01:07:42,497 --> 01:07:45,596
It's not like he didn't have
any feelings for Ah-yeon too

833
01:07:45,597 --> 01:07:47,797
I know

834
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:03,495
I was quite surprised

835
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,595
She made me feel comfortable

836
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:10,296
She also reacted well to what I said,
so I liked it

837
01:08:11,993 --> 01:08:13,893
That's so cool

838
01:09:15,423 --> 01:09:19,333
Huh? What's going on? What
if I'm imagining things?

839
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,059
He's feeling conflicted
after getting the keyring

840
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,759
It's not that he doesn't like Rye-won

841
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,858
But now that he knows
she has feelings for him

842
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:32,759
and his feelings are
heading towards Ah-yeon

843
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:39,611
We don't overlap

844
01:09:39,612 --> 01:09:43,311
- I thought we'd overlap - Really?

845
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,711
Can I guess who you picked?

846
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:49,010
But even if you do,
my mind might change later

847
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:51,711
That's right! We're only in our 2nd day

848
01:09:51,712 --> 01:09:55,912
- This is just good first
impressions - Curiousity, like interest!

849
01:09:56,898 --> 01:09:58,698
Guess then!

850
01:10:02,704 --> 01:10:03,704
It's not him

851
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:06,104
Yeah

852
01:10:07,075 --> 01:10:10,375
I'm going to wait until
I can give my keyring

853
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:13,981
I caught another frog

854
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:16,181
He's coming he's coming

855
01:10:19,118 --> 01:10:21,318
Let's go... So cute

856
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:27,126
Sung... sung-yoon

857
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,399
Here! It's a gift

858
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,799
Wow

859
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,900
- It's cute right? The
sunglasses - Is this what you had?

860
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,300
- Thank you - Sleep tight

861
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,526
She gave it to him

862
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:59,323
- YAYYY - Shhh

863
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:01,323
What's happening right now?

864
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:04,224
What are you doing right now!

865
01:11:07,168 --> 01:11:09,867
Shall we go sleep now guys?

866
01:11:09,868 --> 01:11:13,167
Can we talk about what we just witnessed?

867
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,967
Guys you can't react like that sob...

868
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:19,967
- Sorry sorry,
come here I'll hug you - Shhhh quietly...

869
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:22,968
I'll give you a hug

870
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:34,926
Can you bring him out for me?

871
01:11:58,786 --> 01:12:00,086
You're popular at school, right?

872
01:12:01,122 --> 01:12:02,422
I don't have much friends

873
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:04,543
There's no way

874
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:09,126
Jun-young was the one
who caught my eyes at first

875
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:13,367
Look at them all gathered!
It's like a hot-spot

876
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:16,967
So cute, they've all gathered like that

877
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:20,968
It's something you can
only do when you're a student

878
01:13:49,363 --> 01:13:50,962
- Oh, hey - Hi

879
01:13:50,963 --> 01:13:53,362
It's Jun-young, Jun-young

880
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:55,562
I think it's Dong-wook!!

881
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:57,362
Jun-young? Dong-wook?

882
01:13:57,363 --> 01:13:59,562
This!

883
01:13:59,563 --> 01:14:02,163
What is this?

884
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,820
Oh..

885
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,295
It's Dong-wook!!!

886
01:14:30,296 --> 01:14:32,596
Dong-wook succeeded!

887
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:37,677
Soo-min is so cute

888
01:14:44,052 --> 01:14:46,551
Did you give it? Did you
tell Sung-woon to give it?

889
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:48,752
No, I called him out

890
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:55,589
Hehehe Oh gosh

891
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,589
- Why is this so much fun? - It's not fun

892
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:58,790
It's so fun

893
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,066
Sigh I was like...

894
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:02,666
- How was it? - I dunno, it wasn't cool

895
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:03,667
Just tell me~

896
01:15:03,668 --> 01:15:06,866
- Soo-min is shy - It's not that I'm shy...

897
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:09,866
Soo-min has turned red

898
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:12,566
You can't react so loudly like that

899
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:15,366
Ok, I'll lower it down from now
hehe I was just too excited for you

900
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:18,466
It made me shy

901
01:15:18,467 --> 01:15:21,766
- What was that? - It made me shy!

902
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,467
Look at that!

903
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:28,092
It's so cute... so obvious she does ballet

904
01:15:28,093 --> 01:15:32,592
She didn't bend her knees
but just used her ankles

905
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:35,292
Can we get a replay of that please?

906
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:38,092
It made me shy

907
01:15:38,093 --> 01:15:41,493
- What was that? - It made me shy!

908
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:47,244
She seems like a character, so cute

909
01:15:47,245 --> 01:15:49,945
I should try that hopping from now

910
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,487
Why is this so fun?

911
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,659
It feels good

912
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,260
Look at Dong-wook's face

913
01:16:09,704 --> 01:16:11,503
What should I do? My
heart is beating so fast

914
01:16:11,504 --> 01:16:16,003
I think he needs some
help! Stop it here please

915
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,503
Wouldn't you call that a real song-camp?

916
01:16:17,504 --> 01:16:20,103
- So inspirational for songs
- It will be made in an instant

917
01:16:20,104 --> 01:16:22,903
I'm sure it will be filled with inspiration

918
01:16:22,904 --> 01:16:25,304
It's worth a nobel prize

919
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:37,763
What is this?

920
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,499
Did you get one?

921
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,200
I actually got one too earlier

922
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:50,042
Who gave it to you? Tell us right now

923
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:56,344
- Should we tell? I have an
idea though - I know everyone's

924
01:16:57,418 --> 01:16:59,998
- Tell me - Ok... Soo-min

925
01:17:03,098 --> 01:17:08,798
- It's predictable for him
- Soo-min asked me to get him

926
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:12,296
So I called Dong-wook

927
01:17:12,297 --> 01:17:15,496
I saw it from the beginning

928
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:20,196
- See what? - How she's interested in you

929
01:17:20,197 --> 01:17:23,896
The model would've gotten it from Ah-yeon

930
01:17:23,897 --> 01:17:27,696
You got it from the vocalist

931
01:17:27,697 --> 01:17:28,996
Yu-ri?

932
01:17:28,997 --> 01:17:31,997
- So I'm the other girl - Rye-won

933
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:35,232
But I actually got two

934
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,132
You? Then what do we do?

935
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:40,532
- You got two? - Yeah, I have two

936
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:43,432
- Show us - You got two?

937
01:17:43,433 --> 01:17:46,432
Oh no,
is that even ok? What about him then?

938
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:48,832
That's why I know who gave it to you guys

939
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:52,132
I know Dong-wook because
Soo-min asked me to get him

940
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:55,833
So did you get two at once?
Or did you get it one by one?

941
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:57,677
Oh no, what do we do?

942
01:18:07,121 --> 01:18:09,220
Shouldn't we hide it then?

943
01:18:09,221 --> 01:18:11,920
What about him then?

944
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:15,320
- I mean Jun-young..
- He would've gotten one too...

945
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:17,621
I still understand it..how can...

946
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:21,878
Maybe it was a mistake...

947
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:24,479
- Why would she?
- I don't think it's a mistake at all

948
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:32,443
- You came - Hello welcome back

949
01:18:32,444 --> 01:18:35,743
You don't have to praise
me like that like a boss haha

950
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,044
You came master!

951
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:52,327
Are there any changes to how you guys feel?

952
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:55,627
What about you?

953
01:18:55,628 --> 01:18:58,828
I'm curious to know if anyone is
interested in me... how they feel

954
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:15,680
Do you have a keyring with you?

955
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:19,181
What's that? Was everyone
holding a keyring during night time?

956
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:22,794
What... keyring?

957
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:25,237
Today,
you'll all be watching a movie together

958
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,300
What what what?

959
01:19:27,301 --> 01:19:30,299
We have to decide on seats,
this is totally important

960
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,399
I wonder where Hye-sung will sit

961
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,799
I hope it's that person too

962
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,500
It has to be him for me

963
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:36,209
What do we do!!!

964
01:19:38,712 --> 01:19:39,712
This seems fun!

965
01:19:41,512 --> 01:19:43,511
Let's sing! Let's go to the singing room

966
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,611
I'm so excited!

967
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:46,111
Want me to sing a song?

968
01:19:46,112 --> 01:19:48,311
- Why are you so good?
- I've put them all in

969
01:19:48,312 --> 01:19:50,311
What are you doing? I'll
watch what you're doing

970
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:53,312
- I think the movie will be fun - Yeah

971
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:05,569
- Is this H? - Huh? Yeah it's here

972
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:08,169
Hello..huh?

973
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,769
He's quite... ok

974
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,269
He was very attractive

975
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:15,269
He was on my mind

976
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,969
- Let's have dinner later - Me?

977
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,469
- Yeah - Oh...

978
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,970
He was manly and good looking,
so I was jealous

979
01:20:23,757 --> 01:20:25,856
It was unexpected...
Is this a love tri-angle?

980
01:20:25,857 --> 01:20:28,457
How should I react to this?

981
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:36,249
- You were the prettiest
of them all - Thanks

982
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,249
Was there anyone you were interested in?

983
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,050
Not yet?

984
01:20:40,307 --> 01:20:42,240
Are you confident to be in love?

985
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:44,443
I am

986
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:48,245
Think it was a good choice to choose you
