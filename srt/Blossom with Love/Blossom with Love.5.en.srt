00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,960
Li Yuan draws the curtains and
greets the morning at the base camp.

2
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,170
Hui Ren, please wait a
moment before you freshen up.

3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,210
Li Yuan will be right
back after freshening up.

4
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,730
What's wrong, Huiran? What's wrong?

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,450
What's wrong, Huiran? What's wrong?

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,690
Yayan, who is the boy?
Liyuan, that's funny haha

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,966
Yayan, who is it? Who is
it? Liyuan, I don't know

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,959
Huiren is Huicheng,
Huicheng! Liyuan, really?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Hmm.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,639
Hyun Jin, right? It's Huicheng,

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,470
Sister.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,920
Li Yuan's heart started
racing early in the morning.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,860
Li Yuan: Ah, you scared me.

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,640
Why did you wake up so early? Wearing
white clothes. Actually, it's Dong Xu.

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,510
But, he really should become an actor. Hold on.
Xiumin But (Dongxu) really should become an actor

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,900
Liyuan Xiumin was like

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,130

really handsome Dongxu got his first fan

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,790
Dongxu is getting ready

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,150
Dongxu I keep tripping

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,900
Colliding with Dongxu

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,140

Ouch Ouch

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,360
Chuu seems a bit restless, huh?

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,320
Huicheng is eating chicken breast.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Huicheng, it seems like this was reheated for too long. All the moisture
has evaporated. Yayan, I can tell from here that the meat is very dry.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,920
Huicheng, if you learn ballet,
do you need to eat this regularly?

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,340
Huicheng, you probably don't want to eat
here, right? Yayan, here we don't eat... hehe.

29
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,706
Yayan, do you want to make French
toast? Yuri, I'll make them for you to eat.

30
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,890
Yayan, that's great!

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,400
Yuri, after I finish making them,
who wants to eat them? Who wants?

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,370
Yuri, okay.

33
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,550
Yuri, it's done.

34
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,050
Yayan, are we about to
see the dish Yuri made?

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,100
Okay, thank you.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,286
Huiren, Oh?! The bread has
cracked! Yuri, that's right.

37
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,260
Yayan explained that it became very soft...

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,590
Yuli, eat a little first, I'll cut
it in a while, and then make it again

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,470
Yayan, so cute, huh?
Yuli, you hold it first

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,130

Yayan, so cute! Yuli,

42
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,160
Yuli made French toast for the first time

43

- So cute! - So cute!

44
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:50,220

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,420

Liyuan, is it delicious?

52
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,510
You can add salt later

53
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,710
Huicheng, very soft Yuli, fantastic~!

54
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,856
Huicheng, are you good at playing badminton? Yayan, badminton?
- I can't anymore. - Are you good at playing badminton?

55
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,860
Yayan: Ah, I can play a little. Can you say I'm
good at playing badminton? Huicheng: Wait a moment.

56
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,490
Yayan: Shouldn't you be considered a child
prodigy? Huicheng: I brought it yesterday.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,070
- OK - You initially said that
Junrong should be able to play tennis.

be able to play tennis. Yayan: That's right.

be able to play tennis. Yayan: That's right.

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
However, I learned tennis when I was young. Yayan: But
I learned tennis when I was young! Huicheng: Really?

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,480
Yayan: Is it true? Huicheng: Yes, it is.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,210
Yayan: But I was very young at that time.

64
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,566
Yayan: I bragged like this, I won't be completely unable
to play, right? Huicheng: Is it possible? Is it possible?

65
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,150
Huicheng: At home, if you say
this, you'll get beaten up by mom.

66
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,210
Huicheng: You play really well, huh?

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,319
Huicheng: Too... Ah! Yayan: Hey! This
is too low of a shot, normally speaking.

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
OK OK

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,210
Wait a moment

Hui Cheng, what's the
situation? Ya Yan, isn't it good?

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,796
Hui Cheng, it looks like we have
to go to the gym together Ya Yan, hmm

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,440
Ya Yan, let's try serving from below

77

Hui Cheng, oh, you're
playing very well, very well!

78
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,996
Yayan, can you see my concentrated mouth
shape? Hui Cheng, can't you hit from below?

79
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,890
Is it me?

80
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:20,976
Yayan will never be
able to resist like this.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,876
Hui Cheng, try holding the racket like this. Yayan,
should I move a little closer before hitting?

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,470
Yayan, like this? Hui Cheng:
Like this... hold it like this.

83
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,890

Yayan: OK. Huicheng: Not like this, haha.

Yayan: When did I do this? I always
use one hand to type. Huicheng: Really?

Huiran, red? Xiumin, who has red?

151
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,680
Huiran, is it your brother?

152
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,100
Mine is red.

153
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:56,070
Xiumin will take photos with Junrong.

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,696
Junrong, I have to pay
attention to Dongxu's expression.

155
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,450
Junrong, actually Xiumin
wants to be with Dongxu.

156
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,670
Junrong, but this is still a
chance to get close to Xiumin.

157
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,520
Junrong, so I am a bit excited.

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,760
The girls who haven't been
confirmed yet are Yuli and Yajin.

159
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,230
Next.
The girls who haven't been
confirmed yet are Yuli and Yajin.

160
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,910
The girls who haven't been
confirmed yet are Yuli and Yajin.

161
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,550
Is it different?

162
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,939
Huiran, blue? Black?

163
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,440
- Black - Yes, that's right.

164
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:30,690
Huiran, black? Yuli, blue.

165
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,800
Blue, blue.
Huiran, black? Yuli, blue.

166
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,410
Huiran, black? Yuli, blue.

167
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,010
Yajin, I hope it's Seonyun.

168
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,000
Yajin wrote the same name for three days.

169
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,756
The friend I liked at first sight on the first day, Seonyun.
The most memorable moment today was preparing and having dinner.

170
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,416
Who is my favorite friend right now? Kim Seong-yun What
is the charm of the new friend I just met? Thoughtful

171
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,170
On the third day, I like my
opposite-sex friend Sun-yun

172
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,730
Yayan only has one crush

173
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,760
Yayan, coffee shop, I want to go to a
beautiful coffee shop Go with the person I like

174
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,360
Is it my turn now, Yayan?

175
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,370
JaeJae fell! Could it be a foreshadowing?
- Fell - Please

176
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,780
Could it be a foreshadowing?
JaeJae fell! Could it be a foreshadowing?
- Fell - Please

177
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,490
Could it be a foreshadowing?

178
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,150
JaeJae, please, it's blue, blue.

179
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,706
- Blue, please - What is it?
What is it, Chuu?

180
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,920
JaeJae, blue?

181
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,730
Seungyun, blue.
- Blue - So it's you two.

182
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,671
Yayin and Seungyun went to take
pictures with a film camera together.

183
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,830
Finally! Finally, Yayan!

184
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,910
Congratulations, Yayan.

185
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,340
Yayan is very happy.

186
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,730
Yayan really hopes for this opportunity.

187
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,610
Yayan just happened to
have this opportunity.

188
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,400
Yayan feels happy because she
thinks she can further understand him.

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,750
Yuli, mine is sky blue.

190
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:05,890
Minjian and Yuli become partners.

191
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,190
It's you.
Minjian and Yuli become partners.

192
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,400
Minjian and Yuli become partners.

193
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,850
The partnership of young boys
and girls has been confirmed.

194
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,670
Liyuan, let's meet at 3
o'clock. Yori: OK, sure.

195
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,040
Is it at the dormitory?

196
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,730
Liyuan, I want to go bungee jumping.

197
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,150
Huicheng: Hey, be careful, be careful.

198
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,550
Liyuan: Don't we have any burn ointment?
Huicheng: What happened? Did you get burned?

199
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,550
What?
Liyuan: Don't we have any burn ointment?
Huicheng: What happened? Did you get burned?

200
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,250
Liyuan: Don't we have any burn ointment?
Huicheng: What happened? Did you get burned?

201
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,286
Liyuan, just now there was something on
my forehead... Huicheng: What did you do?

202
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,510
Liyuan: When I was curling
my hair with a curling iron.

203
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,060
Liyuan: Wasn't there anything?

204
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,790
Huicheng: Is that not acceptable?

205
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,990
Huicheng: Spray?

206
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,000
Liyuan: Should I apply that
here... or spray it here?

207
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,850
Huicheng: It seems like it won't work.

208
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,010
Liyuan: But if I use OK
band-aid, it feels a bit strange.

209
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,090
Liyuan, do you know "Ash"
in Pokemon? Feels like him.

210
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,996
Liyuan, should I apply it?
Huicheng, This is for burns!

211
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,290
Liyuan, really? Huicheng, Yes.

212
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,740
Liyuan, you're lying.
Huicheng, We need that.

213
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,436
Zhenglie, can't you help her apply it?

214
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,960
Youqing, Yeah, help her apply it.

215
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,640
Ah~ Help her take a nap.

216
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,370
Huicheng, put that on her forehead.
It can be used for a first-degree burn.

217
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,470
Liyuan, can I stick on an OK bandage?
Huicheng, apply it first before deciding.

218
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,479
Yayan, let's go on a trip~

219
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,579
I want one too.

220
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,806
Yayan, who became partners with Chengyun, is
in a really good mood. ♫ Can hear the echo ♫

221
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,800
♫ Dancing with a sway ♫

222
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,730
Liyuan, are you feeling
better? Yayan, a little bit.

223
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,596
Liyuan, seems like more than just a
little bit? Yayan, I'm just really nervous.

224
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,470
Liyuan, anyway, Chengyun also feels that you're
a bit difficult to talk to. Yayan, really?

225
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,130
Liyuan, so today we can get closer. Yayan,
alright! Should I be more accommodating?

226
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,740
Yayan, let me try~ Liyuan,
Chengyun, put your hand out.

227
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,040
Extend your hand
Yayan, let me try~ Liyuan,
Chengyun, put your hand out.

228
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,900
Extend your hand

229
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,226
Follow me
Yayan, should I do it like this? Hahaha

230
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,836
- You should do it like this
- Should I do it like this?

231
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,540
Let's just do it like this

232
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,710
Liyuan, let's create our own image!
Just like friends, let's give it a try

233
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,120
Yayan, extend your hand

234
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,180
Yayan, shall we go?

235
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,250
Liyuan, even though it's scary,
it probably won't be that bad

236
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,206
Liyuan, you've already held on, how can
you possibly let go? Yayan, he will let go

237
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,690
Yayan, wait a moment! Liyuan, wait a
moment, let go of me, what are you doing?

238
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,760
He will say wait a moment.
Yayan, wait a moment! Liyuan, wait a
moment, let go of me, what are you doing?

239
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:09,910
Yayan, wait a moment! Liyuan, wait a
moment, let go of me, what are you doing?

240
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,480
Wait a moment, let go
of me, what are you doing?
Yayan, wait a moment! Liyuan, wait a
moment, let go of me, what are you doing?

241
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,526
Wait a moment, let go
of me, what are you doing?

242
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,270
Yayan, I'm not interested in you. Liyuan suddenly
said, "I'm interested in Liyuan sister(?)".

243
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,110
-I'm rumbling-Rumbling, it's actually Liyuan
sister. Reversal TV drama, Liyuan and Yayan.

244
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,090
Liyuan, Jin Liyuan is not
interested in you. You are mine.

245
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,600
Yayan, but you never know.
I might change my mind.

246
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,100
No one knows.

247
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,030
No one knows a girl's heart.

248
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,720
The boys' dormitory also
started to get busy recording.

249
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,810
Dongxu, I feel that Seonyoon
has changed since yesterday.

250
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,430
Dongxu, has changed since
yesterday. Seonyoon, what?

251
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,060
Dongxu, has become more positive.

252
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,010
Dongxu and Xiumin are
in the little rest area.

253
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,110
Dongxu, I also want to become
good at playing the piano.

254
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,890
Xiumin, you play really well.

255
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,590
Dongxu, I should choose piano as my major.

256
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,290
Dongxu, then we can play together
in an ensemble or something like that.

257
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,420
Dongxu, that's why I chose... the piano.

258
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,710
Dongxu, go on a date...
but don't be too happy.

259
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,160
Paying attention to Xiumin
and Junrong going out.

260
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,550
Xiumin, do you want to
go to the practice room?

261
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,640
Xiumin, why does it feel even more awkward?

262
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,740
I really want to hear it.

263
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,820
Although it happened two years ago.

264
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,880
It's natural to feel happy.

265
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,190
But my mood is not like that.

266
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,370
But sorry, it's hidden in this broad chest.

267
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,810
Thinking about another person.

268
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,939
27 photos taken together.

269
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,066
Very good, just standing there.

270
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,419
Very good, very good, 1 2 3.

271

hearts of young boys and girls.

1 2 3

273
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,030
Boy: We should be the most
interesting right now. Girl: Is that so?

274
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,040
Boy: Then I'm going to show off.

275
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:24,680
Together with my chosen partner, we will
leave behind memories. Film camera outing.

276
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Very well.
Together with my chosen partner, we will
leave behind memories. Film camera outing.

277
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,560
Together with my chosen partner, we will
leave behind memories. Film camera outing.

278
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,380
What kind of changes will happen
in the hearts of the boy and girl?

279
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,190
Xuan Yayan

280
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,050

Small rest room, practice room, dormitory,
attic, consulting room, personal practice room

290
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,560
Teenage love

291
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,350
Episode 5, stop this
moment, want to remember you

292
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,560
Min-jeon, hello

293
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,550
Dong-xu, wow, this feels great

294
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,340
Li-yuan, I think I take good
photos, right? Dong-xu, ah, really?

295
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,950
- Oh, really? - Mm.
Li-yuan, I think I take good
photos, right? Dong-xu, ah, really?

296
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,750
- Oh, really? - Mm.

297
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,370
Yayan has been smiling all the time.

298
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,826
Chengyun, are there people who have
matured? Yayan, are you referring to me?

299
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,490
Yayan, I have become
more mature with the girls.

300
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,820
Now, it's enough to become close to you.

301
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,170
Yayan, I don't have many
chances to talk to him...

302
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:06,980
Although I try to be around Chengyun.

303
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,320
Let's put the water here.
Although I try to be around Chengyun.

304
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,550
Although I try to be around Chengyun.

305
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,550
Is that alright?
Although I try to be around Chengyun.

306
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:09,700
Although I try to be around Chengyun.

307
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,430
Well, even if it gets mixed
up, there's nothing we can do.
Although I try to be around Chengyun.

308
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,020
Well, even if it gets mixed
up, there's nothing we can do.

309
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,770
Yayan, what is he really thinking?

310
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,240
Yayan, I want to talk to him
and get to know him better.

311
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,440
Yayan, but there's no chance for that...

312
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,600
Yayan, do you have any
place you want to go?

313
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,759
Me? I don't know.

314
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,990
Seonyun, I don't know.

315
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,080
Seonyun, should we go
inside? I'm feeling hot.

316
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,880
Seonyun, bye-bye.

317
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:46,550
Yayan is hesitant to approach him when there are many people
around. So when they are alone together, she wants to chat more.

318
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,420
Let's take it easy and
slowly when taking photos.

319
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,556
Dongxu, how was your trip to the
seaside yesterday? Liyan, the seaside?

320
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,860
Liyan, what did Huicheng say?

321
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,736
Dongxu, let me hear what my sister said
first, then I'll tell you. Liyan, ah, don't!

322
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,866
Dong Xu, ah, why don't you say
something? Li Yuan, ah, I don't want to.

323
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,160
Li Yuan, ah, but I'm
very happy, really happy.

324
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,736
Dong Xu, I think Hui Cheng can't sleep?

325
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,446
Li Yuan, why? Dong Xu,
because he's too happy.

326
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:13,500
Li Yuan, really? I'm
really envious of him(?)

327
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,100
- Really? I envy him - He's very happy.
Li Yuan, really? I'm
really envious of him(?)

328
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,270
- Really? I envy him - He's very happy.

329
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,740
Li Yuan, no, I don't understand him.

330
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,990
Why is Dongxu like this?
Liyuan: He is too introverted.

331
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,430
Dongxu: Is Huicheng okay?
I need to talk to him.

332
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,020
Liyuan: He doesn't say anything. Dongxu:
Really? Is it because he is too shy?

333
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,270
- Really? - Yeah.
Liyuan: He doesn't say anything. Dongxu:
Really? Is it because he is too shy?

334
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,420
Liyuan: He doesn't say anything. Dongxu:
Really? Is it because he is too shy?

335
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,590
It's because he's too shy.
Liyuan: He doesn't say anything. Dongxu:
Really? Is it because he is too shy?

336
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,260
It's because he's too shy.

337
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,140
Liyuan: When it was
Dongxu's turn to be chosen,

338
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,770
Liyuan: Because deep down I hoped it
was Huicheng, so I felt a little regretful.

339
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,790
Liyuan, but after chatting with Dongxu

340
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,760
Liyuan, Dongxu said, 'Huicheng
really likes his sister'

341
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,280
Unable to hide the
upward curve of the mouth

342
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,140
Dongxu: Oh? Have we
arrived? Liyuan: Is it us?

343
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,230
Chengyun: Oh? Did you get on the bus from here earlier? Yayan: Yeah,
that's right. I got on the bus from here! Do you still remember?

344
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,220
The first day of the
Little Love Headquarters

345
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,270
Hello

346
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,630
Yayan, hello to all of you

347
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,700
-Hello -Hello

348
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,670
Still remember the first meeting with Yayan
-Hello -Hello

349
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,830
Still remember the first meeting with Yayan

350
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,109
Film camera outing, Liyuan & Dongxu

351
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,110
Let's go

352
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,390
Liyuan, let's play here
for a while before we go

353
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,190
Liyuan, teach me how to do pull-ups

354
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,560
Dongxu, ah, without basic strength
and muscles, I can't do it...

355
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,646
Liyuan, I'll take a picture for you

356
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,670
Liyuan, 27 photos, right?

357
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:42,500
OK

358
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,730
First time shooting with a film camera.
OK

359
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,250
First time shooting with a film camera.

360
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,130
Liyuan, good, come here.
Stand still for a moment.

361
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,020
Liyuan, take a look at my face.

362
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,790
Liyuan, 1 2 3.

363
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,770
Liyuan, I can't capture this
one properly, wait a moment.

364
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,850
Dongxu, ah... Liyuan, you practice first.
- You practice first. - Alright.

365
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,150
Liyuan, 1 2 3.

366
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,370
Okay.

367
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:10,030
The first photo of Dongxu with fingers(?).

368
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,650
Huh? Fingers?
- Fingers - Fingers

369
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,910
Liyuan is not good at taking pictures.

370
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,450
Liyuan, exercise! Okay, how many times?

371
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,050
Dongxu, 10 times! Liyuan, 10 times! OK!

372
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,666
Dongxu, can you do it? Even
though you exercise a lot...

373
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,380
Liyuan, do 10 times! Dongxu, OK.

374
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,470
Dongxu, ah, it's heavy...

375
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,300
Smooth start of pull-ups

376
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,280
Liyuan 3

377
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,130
Liyuan 6 It's okay to give up!

378
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,670
Liyuan 7 8

379
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,990
Dong Xu Ah... it's heavy

380
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,140
Liyuan It's okay to give up

381
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,160
Liyuan Too bad, 10 reps
Dong Xu Ah, what a pity (?)

382
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,000
Liyuan Can you take a picture for me too?

383
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,680
Liyuan Let me hang on first and see

384
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,030
The first photo taken by Dongxu

385
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,030
Is it good?
OK
The first photo taken by Dongxu

386
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,530
The first photo taken by Dongxu

387
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,026
Chuu Oh? It's taken very well
Not bad

388
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,656
Zhengl o Oh! Taken very well
- Not bad - Taken not bad

389
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:08,320
Liyuan There is a note above indicating how
many photos were taken Dongxu Ah! Very good~

390
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,150
Liyuan Let's take more photos

391
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,130
Liyuan Take a photo~

392
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,016
Dongxu Though it's against the light

393
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,000
Liyuan, against the light? No, there
is no backlight. Dongxu, isn't there?

394
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,830
Liyuan, 1 2 3.

395
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,070
Nature + Dongxu + Finger (?)
OK.

396
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,846
Are there any fingers again?
How are the fingers like?

397
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,066
- Liyuan - It's time to teach her personally.
It's time to teach her personally.

398
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,950
Dongxu, I'm really good at
taking full-body photos. Liyuan: OK.

399
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,450
Dong Xu 1 2...

400
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,370
Dong Xu, ah... Li Yuan, ah!

401
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,150
You should take the photo quickly.

402
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,940
Dong Xu is very good at taking photos.

403
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,880
The photos taken by Li Yuan have no faces.

404
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,310
Finger 1

405
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,420
Finger 2

406
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,220
Finger 3

407
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,630
In the end, only fingers
appeared in the frame.

408
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,010
Dong Xu, let's sit here.

409
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,470
Li Yuan, do you like
shaved ice? Dong Xu: Yes.

410
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,530
Liyuan Wow, it's really delicious.

411
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,130
Dongxu But... I don't
know if I can ask this.

412
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,656
Dongxu Can I ask who you wrote about in your diary if I'm a friend
who wants to know more about it? Liyuan Did I write about someone?

413
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,600
Liyuan Are you talking about Huicheng,
who had the best first impression?

414
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,880
Dongxu But...

415
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,180
Liyuan But what! Dongxu But... Isn't
there someone who rides a bicycle...

416
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,350
-But what -But...
Liyuan But what! Dongxu But... Isn't
there someone who rides a bicycle...

417
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,570
Liyuan But what! Dongxu But... Isn't
there someone who rides a bicycle...

418
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,530
Isn't there a bicycle?
Liyuan But what! Dongxu But... Isn't
there someone who rides a bicycle...

419
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:30,659
Isn't there a bicycle?

420
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,826
Liyuan, is it me? At the beach?
Dongxu, let's go play, okay?

421
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,350
Dongxu, so that's why you like
him even more? Liyuan, is that so...?

422
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,750
Liyuan, but I was really
happy at the beach yesterday.

423
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,480
JaeJae, are you two love
consultants or something?

424
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,460
After the two of them finish eating
the fried noodles, they can separate.

425
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,740
It must be delicious.

426
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,340
Eat a lot of onions.

427
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,720
Hui Ren, come to clear the ice today.

428
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,480
Hui Cheng, defrosting? Hui Ren,
clearing the ice! Empty the refrigerator.

429
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,100
Empty the refrigerator.
Hui Cheng, defrosting? Hui Ren,
clearing the ice! Empty the refrigerator.

430
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,850
Empty the refrigerator.

431
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm preparing the bento
box we will eat together.

432
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,880
Let me slice the lunch meat.
I'm preparing the bento
box we will eat together.

433
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,910
I'm preparing the bento
box we will eat together.

434
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,980
Hui Cheng, first wipe it with kitchen paper
towels, otherwise the oil will stick to your hands.

435
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,610
Hui Cheng, then cut it
like this, it will be easier.

436
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,210
Hui Ren, do you live alone?

437
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,210
What?
Do you live alone?
Hui Ren, do you live alone?

438
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,430
Hui Ren, do you live alone?

439
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,290
Hui Cheng, don't you live with
someone? Hui Ren, how do you know then?

440
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,520
Hui Cheng, because I enjoy cooking. Hui Ren, I'm
actually good at cooking... Does that hurt my pride?

441
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,670
Hui Ren, it looks really unappetizing...

442
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,100
Hui Cheng, we value people for who they are on the
inside. Don't judge solely based on appearance.

443
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,971
Huiren, what if it doesn't taste good and you've already
said that? Huicheng, then we should make it taste better.

444
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,440
The lunchbox we made together is complete.

445
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
It's wrapped so well!
The lunchbox we made together is complete.

446
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,250
The lunchbox we made together is complete.

447
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,960
That's what I'm saying.
The lunchbox we made together is complete.

448
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,250
That's what I'm saying.

449
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,390
Huiren, I wish it
wouldn't rain all the time.

450
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,130
Why? Huiren, because we
can't do anything if it rains.

451
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,980
Film camera outing - Huiren & Huicheng.

452
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,660
Huicheng, do you have a camera?

453
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,630
Huiran, yes. Huicheng, give it to me.

454
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,260
Huiran, dial it here and keep dialing until
it's at the end, then just take the picture.

455
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,226
Huicheng, I'll help you take the picture.

456
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,876
Huiran, How should I pose? Huicheng,
look over there, look at that.

457
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,960
Huicheng, slightly turn
your head to the right.

458
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,190
Zhenglie, I feel like Huicheng
isn't very good at taking photos.

459
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,730
Yes, that's right.
Zhenglie, I feel like Huicheng
isn't very good at taking photos.

460
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:31,780
Zhenglie, I feel like Huicheng
isn't very good at taking photos.

461
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,110
Chuu Ah, Hui Cheng, right? I'm looking forward to it.
- Take a look. -Ah, Hui Cheng, right?

462
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,740
I'm looking forward to it.
Chuu Ah, Hui Cheng, right? I'm looking forward to it.
- Take a look. -Ah, Hui Cheng, right?

463
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:33,770
Chuu Ah, Hui Cheng, right? I'm looking forward to it.
- Take a look. -Ah, Hui Cheng, right?

464
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,010
JaeJae If Hui Cheng can't take photos,
he and Li Yuan are meant to be together.

465
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,420
Hui Ren, I'll help you take photos too.

466
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
That's just how I am. Flaunt your
handsomeness to your heart's content.

467
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,710
The first film camera photo
we helped each other take.

468
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,070
Not a bad photo.
- Not bad - Not bad, yeah

469
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,850
Huicheng, what's over
there? Is it a bicycle?

470
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,740
Huicheng, moved Huiren, I
really like this kind of thing

471
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,940
Huicheng, if there's something nice in the
middle, take a picture and then go Huiren, okay

472
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,300
Huicheng, you go ahead, I'll
follow behind Huiren, got it

473
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,430
Huicheng, be careful

474
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,540
Huiren, oh...

475
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,950
Huirun: Oh!!!

476
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,940
Huirun: Are you keeping up? Huicheng:
Yes, I'm following right behind you~

477
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,430
Huirun: It feels so refreshing.
Huicheng: Yes, it really does.

478
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,741
Huicheng: I think we're the most
interesting now. Huirun: Is that so?

479
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,990
Huirun: Then I'm going to show off.

480
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,590
Huicheng: That sounds great, right? Huirun: Yeah,
did you ride a bicycle continuously for two days?

481
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,010
Huicheng, but really awesome.

482
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,080
Huicheng, the dogs are so
handsome. Huiran, the children? Why?

483
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
What?
Huicheng, the dogs are so
handsome. Huiran, the children? Why?

484
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,670
Huicheng, the dogs are so
handsome. Huiran, the children? Why?

485
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,420
Hmm.
Huicheng, the dogs are so
handsome. Huiran, the children? Why?

486
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:04,670
Hmm.

487
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,190
Huicheng, feels very cool. Huiran, yes, they
have gathered some really talented people (?).

488
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,390
Huicheng, they all look like gun-hunting
dogs. Huiran, gun-hunting dogs? Where?

489
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,390
Hmm.
Huicheng, they all look like gun-hunting
dogs. Huiran, gun-hunting dogs? Where?

490
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,730
Huicheng, they all look like gun-hunting
dogs. Huiran, gun-hunting dogs? Where?

491
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,370
Miscommunication caused by
the distance between two people.

492
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,990
Pay attention to see the front well.
Miscommunication caused by
the distance between two people.

493
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,460
Pay attention to see the front well.

494
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,920
Huirun, I want to do that.

495
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,290
Huirun, will I be scolded if
I help Yungyun cut her bangs?

496
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,580
Huicheng, I don't know... Bangs?
Huirun, I feel like it can't see the front.

497
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,900
- Hmm - I feel like it can't see the front.
Huicheng, I don't know... Bangs?
Huirun, I feel like it can't see the front.

498
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,860
Huicheng, I don't know... Bangs?
Huirun, I feel like it can't see the front.

499
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,730
Huicheng, separate the fur a little.

500
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,500
Huirun, I want to ask that dog's father(?).

501
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,430
Huicheng, are you a dog dad?
Do you have a dog dad? Hmm.

502
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,460
Chengyun.

503
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,550
Aiyo aiyo aiyo.

504
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,340
Huiru, he came out to walk the dog without
even grooming first. Huicheng, really?

505
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,210
Huiru, he came out to
walk the dog wearing a hat?

506
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,990
Huicheng, does he really like it?
Hmm.

507
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,240
Huicheng, if there are nice places, we can
take pictures before leaving. Huiru, okay.

508
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,980
Huicheng, 25 tickets? Huiren:
Yes, we have 25 tickets.

509
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,140
Huicheng, I feel like we should
take a photo here. Huiren: Here?

510
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,180
Yes.
Huicheng, I feel like we should
take a photo here. Huiren: Here?

511
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,140
Yes.

512
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,940
Huiren: That's great.

513
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,840
Huicheng: Don't you
feel it's very cool here?

514
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,020
Yes.
Huicheng: Don't you
feel it's very cool here?

515
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,600
Yes.

516
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,800
Huicheng: Isn't it
beautiful? This kind of grass.

517
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,980
Huiren: Can we take this kind
of scenery? Huicheng: Scenery?

518
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,380
Yes.
Huiren: Can we take this kind
of scenery? Huicheng: Scenery?

519
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,590
Yes.

520
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:20,686
Huiren: Didn't we say we don't have to be in the
picture? Huicheng: Can't we take landscape photos? Right?

521
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,030
Huicheng spider? Do you want
to take a picture of spiders?

522
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,740
Where is Huicheng?

523
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,580
Huiren, where is the spider?
Huicheng, the spider is here.

524
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,105
Come here, here.

525
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,100
Personally tell the location.

526
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,170
Photos from the ecological experience learning
site(?) It seems to be in the ecological experience.

527
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,970
Huicheng, it's dogtail grass.

528
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,050
Huiren, let's show it to the dogs.

529
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,710
Huicheng, tell them it's for
you? Huiren, hmm, it's your friend.

530
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,210
Hui Ren wants to bring
Tuan Tuan and Yun Yun.

531
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,489
They will feel hot.

532
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,490
Hui Cheng, but if they fall into this
field, it will be really dangerous...

533
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,386
Hui Ren, they have already fallen in. Hui
Cheng: Ah! You said they have fallen in, right?

534
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,330
Hui Ren, when I was walking Tuan Tuan just
now, it fell in. Cheng Yun carried it out.

535
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,136
Hui Ren, I have photos.
Do you want to go there?

536
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,190
Mm-hmm.

537
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,075
This morning.

538
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,230
It looks so good. How is it here, etc.

539
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,470
Quickly grab Tuantuan, who fell
into the field, and pull him out.

540
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,140
Did he fall down?
Quickly grab Tuantuan, who fell
into the field, and pull him out.

541
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,340
Quickly grab Tuantuan, who fell
into the field, and pull him out.

542
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Mm, below.
Quickly grab Tuantuan, who fell
into the field, and pull him out.

543
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,510
Quickly grab Tuantuan, who fell
into the field, and pull him out.

544
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,740
He fell down.
Quickly grab Tuantuan, who fell
into the field, and pull him out.

545
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,720
He fell down.

546
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,000
No, he looks too much like dad.

547
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,170
Hui Ren captured this moment.

548
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,326
Zheng Lie kept talking about the puppy.

549
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,179
Did Chuu say "dog" because
she thought of a dog?

550
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,206
- No, she was saying "Seong Yeon" next to
her. Seong Hoon was saying "Seong Yeon"...

551
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,126
Because there's no other way to
say she wants to bring Seong Yeon.

552
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,880
To Hui Jin, it's like Kang Heung Hyeok
(?) (Note: A famous dog trainer in Korea)

553
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,520
Kim Seong Yeon now
To Hui Jin, it's like Kang Heung Hyeok
(?) (Note: A famous dog trainer in Korea)

554
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,440
Kim Seong Yeon now

555
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,650
Film camera outing: Yae Yeon & Seong Yeon

556
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:45,050
Yae Yeon: Sea salt bread! Do you like sea
salt bread? Seong Yeon: I haven't had it much.

557
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,630
Yayan, I love eating sea salt
bread so much...! Seonyun: Oh, really?

558
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,660
Seonyun: It's right here,
look here. Yayan: Here?

559
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,199
Yayan: Then I trust you.
Seonyun: Seems like it.

560
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Hmm.

561
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,360
Yayan: So beautiful.

562
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,856
Seonyun: I feel like after returning home, I will miss
Tuantuan and Yinyin. Yayan: Just go and see them right away.

563
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,200
Yayan: Oh! It's corn!

564
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,600
Yayan, corn is so tall. I
also wish to be that tall.

565
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,266
Chengyun, is it better to
be taller when doing ballet?

566
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,180
Yayan, it can't be too tall or too short.

567
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,070
Yayan, because when partnering with
others, it's difficult if too tall.

568
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,599
Yayan, if too short... Being too tall or too
short, it's too obvious during a group dance.

569
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Group dance?
Um

570
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,570
Chengyun: Ah, everyone jumping
together? Yayan: Um, group dance!

571
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,036
Shangxun: Chengyun, make your steps
smaller... you're walking too fast now.

572
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,810
Zhenglie: Right? It's fast, right?
- Yes, yes - Right, it's fast

573
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,140
- Really - Walking super fast
Walking super fast
Zhenglie: Right? It's fast, right?
- Yes, yes - Right, it's fast

574
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,980
- Really - Walking super fast
Walking super fast

575
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,990
Chengyun: Oh? It's an ice cream truck.

576
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,790
Yayan: Where should we go first? Do you want to
eat ice cream first? Chengyun: Ice cream? Sure.

577
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,110
Hello, Chengyun. Hello, Yayan.

578
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,620
Yayan, should we order two
servings of ice cream? Hmm, sure!

579
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,390
Is it hot?

580
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:04,740
Chengyun, huh? It's 25,
right? Is it 25 after 27?

581
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,590
Yayan, it's because of this
point. Chengyun, is it 26?

582
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,080
Yayan, it gets stuck every time
it turns. Just tap it at that time!

583
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,680
Yayan, can you give it a try?

584
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,090
Chengyun is still
unfamiliar with film cameras.

585
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,390
Just press the shutter button
when the card is inserted.
Chengyun is still

Yayan Put this in.

590
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,060
Yayan Oh? Should we take a picture
of the ice cream? Chengyun Oh? Sure.

591
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,206
Yayan You try taking a photo. Chengyun
Right, I want to take a picture of this.

592
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,430
Chengyun Is it okay to take it like this? Yayan Yes,
but be careful not to touch the lens with your hand.

593
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,250
Ya Yan, OK

594
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,700
The protagonist of the first photo is ice cream - Is it done?
- Yeah, it's done
Very good

595
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,980
The protagonist of the first photo is ice cream - Is it done?
- Yeah, it's done

596
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,360
Ya Yan, then next time when taking the
photo, turn around first and then take it

597
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,196
Ya Yan, I'll put it in first. Take
it out when we take the photo next time

598
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,350
Cheng Yun, is the bag heavy? Ya Yan,
no, it's not heavy at all, it's fine

599
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,110
Cheng Yun, it's a dairy
cow... Ya Yan, wow...!

600
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,760
Ya Yan is so beautiful, they are all~

601
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,640
Cheng Yun Wow

602
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,000
Cheng Yun Do you want me to help
you carry the bag? Ya Yan Maybe later

603
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,780
Cheng Yun Animal Farm?

604
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,369
Ya Yan They are all small
animals Cheng Yun Really?

605
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,370
Hmm

606
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,870
A place where cute animals gather

607
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,340
Cheng Yun Wow!

608
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,250
-Wow -Oh my god
Ya Yan Oh my god?

609
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,440
Chengyun: Let's take that one, little pig.
Yayan: Let's take it, take it, take it.

610
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,370
Yayan: It's so cute.

611
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,270
Chengyun: This is the first
time I've heard this kind of sound.

612
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,350
Happy.

613
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,020
Chengyun is filming the little pig.

614
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,500
Yayan: Oh, so cute. I want to raise pigs.

615
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,390
Chengyun: Do you want to
raise pigs? Yayan: Mini pig.

616
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,670
Yayan: Is it a chicken?

617
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,486
Chengyun: This is the first
time I've seen such a chicken!

618
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,326
JaeJae: Are we going to take
pictures of chickens again?

619
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,730
Can't be true...

620
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,920
Chengyun: Oh yeah!

621
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,650
Hey!! Did you really
take pictures of chickens?

622
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,130
-Chengyun: As expected.
As expected.

623
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,710
-Chengyun: Chengyun.

624
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,300
Chengyun: Oh, it's a hamster.
-Chengyun: Chengyun.

625
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,360
Chengyun: Oh, it's a hamster.

626
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,250
Yayan: Oh, they are
so cute, just like this!

627
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,946
You can't even take
pictures of guinea pigs!

628
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,330
Take a picture of Yayan...

629
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,900
Guinea pig, click

630
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,746
Chengyun, take a picture of the rabbit
too? Yayan, do you want to take one?

631
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,120
Chengyun, who do you
want to take a picture of?

632
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,910
Chengyun, over here? Yayan, yes

633
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:44,420
Rabbit, sheep, chicken, big chicken

634
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,200
Rabbit sheep chicken Big chicken incubator

635
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,110
Look at that! Why take a picture of the incubator?
- Look at that - Why take a picture of this?

636
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,830
Why take a picture of the incubator?
Look at that! Why take a picture of the incubator?
- Look at that - Why take a picture of this?

637
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:48,900
Why take a picture of the incubator?

638
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,360
JaeJae, really, are you kidding?
You've taken a few pictures already.
Why take a picture of the incubator?

639
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,990
JaeJae, really, are you kidding?
You've taken a few pictures already.

640
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,680
Oh, so frustrating!

641
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,380
Chengyun went to see the
chickens, and there are chicks too.

642
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,970
Chengyun: Peacock! I saw a peacock.

643
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,870
Chengyun: Pigs are also very
cute, they always lie down and sleep.

644
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,470
Chengyun: It feels very
magical and very interesting.

645
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,640
Zhenglie: Why don't you look at Yayan...

646
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,520
Youqing: Yayan is also very cute.

647
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,610
Yayan: They are all gathered together.

648
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,086
Chengyun: Let's take a photo of
this too? This time you take a photo.

649
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,430
Yayan, let's take the shot, okay?

650
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,016
Yayan, you stand in position.
Chengyun, start with this one (?)

651
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,686
Yayan, should we take
a photo? Chengyun, yes.

652
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,530
Chengyun, just focus on the cows...

653
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,190
Yayan, 1 2 3.

654
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,100
Title: Just Focus on the Cows.

655
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,820
Yayan, we need to save (film).

656
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,720
Yayan, what happens after we take the shot..?
Chengyun, can I touch them? They shouldn't bite, right?

657
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,006
Ye-yan, but it doesn't hurt when they bite,
right? Cheng-yun, I hope they don't bite me.

658
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,500
Cheng-yun, oh oh!!

659
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,036
Cheng-yun, it's my first time
seeing a dairy cow with my own eyes.

660
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,900
Cheng-yun, I found that it's very
big and its tongue is also very long.

661
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,606
Cheng-yun, when I look at it up
close, I feel it's very fascinating.

662
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,760
Ya-yan, wow~

663
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,330
Cheng-yun, wow! Ya-yan, oh
my god, oh my god, oh my god.

664
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,795
Chengyun, ah, is it a goat?

665
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:06,920
- Yes, a goat - a goat
Chengyun is a goat!

666
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,780
Chengyun, let's take a picture of each animal,
shall we? Ya Yan: Hmm, you take the picture.

667
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,930
Add a photo of a goat.

668
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,990
Ya Yan: Is it a calf?
It's a bit big, isn't it?

669
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,620
Ya Yan: Do you want to go inside
and have a look? Chengyun: Let's go in.

670
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:26,930
OK.
Ya Yan: Do you want to go inside
and have a look? Chengyun: Let's go in.

671
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,620
OK.

672
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,600
Yayan: Oh, come here, come here, come here.

673
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,570
Yayan: Oh, it seems like
something is about to come out.

674
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,610
Chengyun: 1, 2, 3.

675
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,320
Yayan and Xiaoniu 1.

676
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,180
Yayan and Xiaoniu 2.

677
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,640
Yayan and Xiaoniu 3.

678
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,950
Let me take a picture for you, look here.

679
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,250
Chengyun: Oh... no good!

680
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,940
Yayan: Treat it like a little dog.

681
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,240
Yayan: We need to save (film),
I'll help you shoot a video.

682
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,930
Yayan, don't you have
any strength? Seon-yun, uh!

683
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,676
Yayan, how did you snatch it away? Next: To
save film, I used a phone to take pictures.

684
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,060
I used a phone to take pictures to save
film. Next: Yayan, you drank all of my milk.

685
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,211
Yayan, you drank all of my
milk. Next: Chengyun, ah-choo!

686
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,809
Chengyun, ah-choo! Next: Yayan, go
feed the sheep. Chengyun, ah-choo!

687
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,810
Yayan, go feed the
sheep. Chengyun, ah-choo!

688
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,840
Yayan, do you have any allergies?
Chengyun, I don't know either.

689
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,549
Chengyun, achoo! It seems like it's an allergy.
Yayan, what should we do? What are you going to do?

690
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,669
Yayan, let's go out from here.

691
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,149
Yayan, don't you need to take medicine?
Chengyun: Hmm, it's not that serious.

692
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,790
Yayan: Ah, that's strange. It should be a
mild allergy. Chengyun: Yeah, a mild allergy.

693
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,989
Chengyun can't stop sneezing.
What should we do?

694
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,230
Yayan: What are you allergic to? Fur?
Chengyun: I don't know either. It could be.

695
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,690
Yayan wants to take photos of us too...

696
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,769
Yayan, we only have 9 film
negatives left... Chengyun, really?

697
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,359
Chengyun, but we have taken
too many photos of animals...

698
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,320
Yayan, shall we not take a photo of
the donkey? Chengyun, we can take one.

699
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,709
Yayan, stand still, let
me take a photo of you here.

700
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,780
Chengyun, no, I don't want to take a
photo alone. Yayan, ah... what's wrong?

701
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,920
Yayan, shall we take a
photo together? Chengyun, yes.

702
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,500
Yayan, let the donkey be in the frame too.

703
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Chengyun, can you take
it? Yayan, come closer.

704
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,160
Yayan, 1 2 3.

705
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,289
Yayan, you should have captured it, right?

706
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,606
Chengyun, you should have captured
it, right? Yayan, it's random.

707
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,970
Yayan's first time taking a
photo with Chengyun and the donkey.

708
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,369
Captured it.

709
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,939
JaeJae, Yayan took it really well.

710
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,250
Shang Xun Ya Yan ah! Ya Yan is
amazing, I'm so relieved, so relieved.

711
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,250
- Ya Yan ah - luckily.
Shang Xun Ya Yan ah! Ya Yan is
amazing, I'm so relieved, so relieved.

712
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:19,350
Shang Xun Ya Yan ah! Ya Yan is
amazing, I'm so relieved, so relieved.

713

- Ya Yan is amazing - that's great.
Shang Xun Ya Yan ah! Ya Yan is
amazing, I'm so relieved, so relieved.

714
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:20,480
Shang Xun Ya Yan ah! Ya Yan is
amazing, I'm so relieved, so relieved.

715
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,240
I'm so relieved, so relieved.
Shang Xun Ya Yan ah! Ya Yan is
amazing, I'm so relieved, so relieved.

716
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,640
I'm so relieved, so relieved.

717
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,940
Ya Yan, we definitely need to take this.

718
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,780
Cheng Yun and Yang.

719
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,690
Ya Yan and Yang.

720
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,660
Hello little friend, Ya
Yan! Do you like sheep?

721
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,910
Hello everyone.

722
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,100
Hello.

723
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,390
Hello.

724
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,900
Yayan, how old are you?

725
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,560
Four years old.

726
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,370
Yayan, you're four years old?
Give your sister a high-five.

727
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,680
Cute.

728
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,040
Yayan, wow, give a
high-five while stepping back.

729
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,415
Yayan, it should be fun over there.
Chengyun, isn't that the restroom?

730
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,860
- No, this is the swimming pool.
- Oh, a swimming pool.

731
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,480
Yayan, no, this is the swimming pool.
- No, this is the swimming pool.
- Oh, a swimming pool.

732
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,030
Yayan, no, this is the swimming pool.

733
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,829
Seonyun I don't really like
water. Yayeon Ah, really?

734
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,129
Seonyun lives here in the jungle.

735
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,270
Shanghun Uncle and aunt are leaving.
Seonyun will live here on the farm.

736
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,629
Yayeon Shall we go buy some
snacks? But are there seagulls?

737
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,650
Where are the seagulls?

738
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:33,910
Seonyun Where? Seagulls? Yayeon
There, there are also seagulls.

There, there are also seagulls.

742
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,320
- There really is. - There is there too.

743
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,849
Chengyun, just buy one pack, okay? Yayan,
do you want to go and buy? Shrimp crackers.

744
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:44,390
Chengyun, just buy one pack. They can't
eat too much... Yayan, we'll eat the rest.

745
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,160
Yayan, wow, there are firecrackers too.

746
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,830
Yayan, shrimp crackers...?

747
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,370
Yayan, oh? It's here. Chengyun, it's here.

748
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,570
Chengyun: Just buy a pack. Yayan: Mmm.

749
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,039
Chengyun: Oh? Kinder Surprise Eggs.

750
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,010
Chengyun: Huiren was looking
for Kinder Surprise Eggs yesterday.

751
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,690
- Huiren? - Mmm.

752
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,610
Huiren?

753
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,870
Yayan stopped talking.

754
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,809
Chengyun: Oh? It's seagulls.

755
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,110
Yayan: Hey, let's take a
look? How can we get there?

756
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,710
Will they eventually come to eat?

757
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,870
Thanks to the seagull,
the conversation resumed.
Will they eventually come to eat?

758
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,150
Thanks to the seagull,
the conversation resumed.

759
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,250
Yayan, aren't they coming? Chengyun, if we
keep holding it up like this, they should come.

760
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,919
Chengyun, oh!

761
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,460
Yayan, wow, they ate it!

762
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,470
Chengyun, oh oh oh! They ate the shrimp strips in
the air. Hurry up! Yayan, really? Did you throw it?

763
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,460
When they come over

764
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,380
Yayan: Hmm... What should we take?

765
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,820
Chengyun: Just two shots
will be enough. Yayan: Yeah.

766
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,250
- Is this one? - Hmm.

767
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,590
Chengyun: Is this one? Or
two? Yayan: Is it two shots?

the seaside and take a look?

Yayan, Seonyoon...

proactive in speaking?

791
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,940
I thought you would muster up the
courage to start a conversation first...

792
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,240
Chengyun Because I don't talk much...

793
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,430

829
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,650
The two of them are very suitable.

830
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,059

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,800
Yuli, do you... quickly fall in love with someone? Do you immediately get into
love? Or does it take a long time? (Note: Referring to falling in love instantly)

843
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,939
Minjian, honestly, I'm the type to
fall in love quickly. Yuli, really?

844
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,250
Minjian, how about you? Yuli, it
seems like I'll take a long time.

845
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,680
Yuli, I feel like I need to
chat more with the other person.

846
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,789
Yuli, it takes me a long
time to get close to someone.

It's very quiet in the car.

895
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,290
Xiumin, my bangs were too long, they would look
strange after curling them with a curling iron.

896
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,130
Xiumin, so I cut them myself. Junrong,

Junrong, she kind of looks
like Zhang Yuanying today.

906
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,860

to go out with today?

912

Xiumin, are you not disappointed
that I brought out the red (badge)?

913
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,979
Joon Young, that's good.

00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,050
Jeong Mi, that's good.

915
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,020
Joon Young, I... have a hard time
getting closer to her naturally.

916
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,559
Joon Young, I can't
naturally get closer to her.

917
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,260
Joon Young will become very nervous
and also won't be able to talk to her...

918
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,170
It seems like that.

919
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:40,630
The young boy became very shy.

920
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,240
Junrong, when will you go to Germany?

921
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,310

Xuemin, so I plan to go earlier.

924
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,620
Junrong, ah, I'm so envious...

925
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
Junrong, I haven't gone
to university yet either.

926
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:06,730
Junrong, I might stay in China
for a while and then go to Europe.

927
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,310
Let's meet during this period, shall we?

928
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:10,400

Use clapping hands instead of check marks

Xiumin Should I hold onto this?
Junrong I'll help you with that

984
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,089
Xiumin This pose requires longer
legs to look good in the photo, right?

985
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,830
Junrong Very good, very good, it looks very good.

The first photo of the two
people was taken by Xiumin

00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,750
Jun Rong blew bubbles against
his mouth like this, "Whoosh~"

Jun Rong: Oh, it looks super good,
right? Xiumin: Of course it looks good!

995
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,500
Give it a blow, just a little blow

996
00:47:57,501 --> 00:48:00,230
Like this, the boy captured the girl

997
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,570
It's just like a painting, a painting

Rong It's difficult to capture the bubbles

1002
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,810
Xiumin, I have confidence
in making giant bubbles.

1003
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,796
Junrong, can you capture the effect?

1004
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,750
My finger is blocking the lens.
Will it capture my finger?

1005
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,790
Oh yeah!
My finger is blocking the lens.
Will it capture my finger?

photo taken by a girl of a boy she likes.

Give it a wave.

1009
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,640
Xiumin, wait... This is not what I wanted.

1010
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,750
Xiumin, let me practice
using the bubble first.

1011
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,510
It has to be done like this, like this

Shangxun, are you good at talking?

1030
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,440

Junrong: Should we take couple
photos this time? Xiumin: Sure, why not.

1034
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,606
Junrong: You think we will look better in the photos taken
here, right? Xiumin: Yes, but I don't really mind either way.

1035
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,806
- Which side of my face looks better?
- Sit on my left side. Xiumin: Which side of my face looks better? Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

1036
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,830
Junrong: Both sides of your face
look good. Xiumin: Of course, haha.

1037
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:41,770
I feel the left side is a bit better.

1038
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,369
Junrong, you sit on the right
side, I'll sit on the left side.

1039
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:48,670
Junrong, if we look at each other, we'll definitely
laugh and burst out laughing in that moment. Got it?

1040
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,239
Xiumin, but I think... when we turn around, we'll
also burst out laughing. Junrong, sit, sit, sit.

How can we escape?

1045
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,960
The girl suddenly became shy.
I can't do this, it's a little strange.

1046
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,430
It's a little strange.

1047
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,620

00:50:38,711 --> 00:50:42,290
Junrong, because I don't have a girlfriend,
I can hardly take a boyfriend's photo.

1069
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,829
Xiumin, I told you... If you confess to
anyone casually, you can have a girlfriend.

1070
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:47,860
Really?

1071
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,990
Hmm

1072
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,659
Will you be my girlfriend?

1073
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,660
Okay

1074
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,250
Oh my god...

1075
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,490
Will you be my girlfriend?

1076
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,480
Good.
Will you be my girlfriend?

1077
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,490
Good.

1078
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,780
Junrong Because it’s
just me and Xiumin, so...

1079
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,689
Junrong Dongxu is also
not here... so when chatting

1080
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,720
Junrong It seems like
we can be more natural

1081
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:21,100
I thought if it wasn't now, maybe I wouldn't have time to talk
about these things So I expressed my feelings more actively

1082
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,810
The young man started
expressing his feelings

1083
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,080
Junrong Be careful, it's too steep here...

1084
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,010
Xiumin Aiyo, what happened?

1085
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,540
Go over there and take a look.

1086
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,630
This place is also very beautiful.

1087
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,670
Zhenglie, grab it. That's right, very good.

1088
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,259
Did you dislocate your arm?

1089
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,590
Xiumin, oh dear, what happened?

1090
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,910
Go over there and take a look.

1091
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,910
This place is also very beautiful.

1092
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,929
Then let's take a photo here as well.

1093
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,890
Junrong, very good, very
good, very good-looking.

1094
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,309
Junrong, oh, it looks super good
now. Xiumin, is it good-looking?

1095
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,310
Hmm.

1096
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,600
That's hilarious.

1097
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,850
Showmin, wow, you look
like Stray Kids' Felix.

1098
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,750
Junrong, is he your
ideal type? Showmin, Hmm.

1099
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:15,810
Junrong, try taking a picture with your girlfriend
following behind. Showmin, I'll imitate a girlfriend.

1100
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,330
Very good, very good,
your reaction is great.

1101
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,840
The girl and the boy take
similar photos in the same place.

1102
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,530
In the photo, I seem to look a bit old.
The girl and the boy take
similar photos in the same place.

1103
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,400
The girl and the boy take
similar photos in the same place.

1104
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Junrong, you go stand there, I'll stand next to you. Let me adjust my position.
- Let me adjust my position. - Okay.
You go stand there, I'll stand next to you.

1105
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,601
Junrong, you go stand there, I'll stand next to you. Let me adjust my position.
- Let me adjust my position. - Okay.

1106
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,810
Junrong, just right there.

1107
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,880
Junrong, I'm here.

1108
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,800
Junrong, is it okay now?
Xiumin, are you still shooting?

1109
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,730
Junrong, it seems okay. Xiumin, yeah.

1110
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,340
Junrong: Oh? We got the shot.

1111
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,510
Xiumin: Oh, like a married couple.

1112
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,169
Junrong: A married couple
on their honeymoon trip?

1113
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:11,040
Xiumin: A married couple on their
honeymoon trip to the Maldives.

1114
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,710
Junrong: Shall we take
a selfie? Xiumin: Sure!

1115
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,936
Junrong: I hope it turns out good after developing.
Xiumin: It will turn out good after developing. Oh dear...

1116
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,599
Ouch

1117
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,000
Be careful...
- Be careful. - Okay.

1118
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,510
Xiumin ah

1119
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,525
Let's date~ Let's date~ - Let's date, let's date.
- This is a honeymoon trip.

1120
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:45,139
Let's date, let's date.

1121
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,606
Zhenglie, I want to invest in Jin Junrong.
- I want to invest in Jin Junrong. - Really?

1122
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,620
I want to as well.

1123
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:48,820
If there's love, I'll
invest in Junrong too.

1124
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,936
- Do you want to join as a partner?
- Yes, let's do it together.
If there's love, I'll
invest in Junrong too.

1125
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:49,960
If there's love, I'll
invest in Junrong too.

1126
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,186
Please invest, please invest,
you can become a shareholder.
If there's love, I'll
invest in Junrong too.

1127
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:51,210
If there's love, I'll
invest in Junrong too.

1128
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:51,220
It's very hot, let's go inside and wait for a while. Jun Rong, it's very hot,
let's go inside and wait for a while. Then we can come out to take photos, right?
If there's love, I'll
invest in Junrong too.

It's very hot, let's go inside and wait for a while. Jun Rong, it's very hot,
let's go inside and wait for a while. Then we can come out to take photos, right?

1130
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,726
- Then we can come out to take photos, right?
- Okay, that's good.

1131
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:01,206
Take it slow because once we finish taking photos, we'll have to go back.
- Take it slow because once we finish taking photos, we'll have to go back. - Okay.

1132
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,630
Jun Rong, hello Xiu Min, hello

1133
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,300
I want cold brew coffee

1134
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,400
Jun Rong, I want cold brew coffee
Xiu Min, no, can I help you choose?

Jun Rong, I want cold brew coffee

Jun Rong, I want cold brew coffee
Xiu Min, no, can I help you choose?

1137
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:08,820
- No, can I help you choose? - Okay

1138
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,730
Agzak cold brew latte

1139
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:10,940
Choose drinks for each other

1140
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,840
- How about drinking a chocolate latte?
- Chocolate latte, sure
Choose drinks for each other

1141
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,890
- How about drinking a chocolate latte?
- Chocolate latte, sure

1142
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,080
Cake advertisement
I feel like shooting an ad

1143
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,660
Suddenly took out a photo

1144
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,930
Junrong, this is a gift, looking
for the owner Xiumin, thank you

1145
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,869
Xiumin, this seems to be a meaningful photo

1146
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:47,440
Junrong, keep it well
Xiumin, I will keep it well

1147
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,586
Xiumin, by the way, who were you
planning to travel with originally?

1148
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,880
Junrong, I wanted to travel with you

1149
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,520
Xiumin, I see. Who is next?

1150
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,129
Junrong, next? There isn't anyone, huh?

1151
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,130
Why?

1152
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,760
Xiumin, hmm? Why?

1153
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,670
Junrong, I don't know. There
just isn't. Xiumin, I see.

1154
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:23,510
Xiumin, this morning I thought you
were in a bad mood. Junrong, me? Why?

1155
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,480
Xiumin, usually when you
eat, you would talk a lot...

1156
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,820
Xiumin, but you didn't say
anything, just like this...

1157
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:32,580
Just like this.

1158
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:32,910
Junrong, am I like this? Haha.
Am I like this?
Just like this.

1159
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:33,920
Junrong, am I like this? Haha.
Am I like this?

1160
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,220
Hmm, just like this.
Junrong, am I like this? Haha.
Am I like this?

1161
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:34,920
Hmm, just like this.

1162
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,820
This morning.

1163
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,329
Xiumin, why does everyone
seem to be in a bad mood today?

1164
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,399
Huiren, who? All the boys?

1165
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,800
Huiren, is it because it's morning?

1166
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,270
Xiumin, really...?

1167
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,830
Are you tired, Xiumin? Did we argue yesterday?
Why do you keep imagining things like this?

1168
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:58,810
Junrong, who did you like when you first met? First
impression. Xiumin: Actually, I liked you the most, Jie.

1169
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,810
No, it was really walking
over with an umbrella.

1170
00:56:01,811 --> 00:56:02,270
A strong first impression
that Xiumin couldn't forget.

1171
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,150
I can't forget that scene.
A strong first impression
that Xiumin couldn't forget.

1172
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,480
A strong first impression
that Xiumin couldn't forget.

1173
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,510
Remember for a lifetime, oh.
- Remember for a lifetime, oh. -Hmm.

1174
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,730
Jun Rong, what hairstyle should I do
tomorrow? I want to hear your recommendation.

1175
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,760
Xiù Mǐn, try the airplane head
tomorrow. Style your hair up like that.

1176
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,530
Jun Rong, an airplane head? Xiù
Mǐn, yes, all combed to the back!

1177
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,916
Xiù Mǐn, why not give it a try? Won't it be cool like
walking on a runway? Jun Rong, I'll give it my best shot.

1178
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,270
Xiumin, I originally had my hair
down But it was too hot so I tied it up

1179
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,440
Xiumin, now my hair
is all stuck together...

1180
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,490
I didn't bring any hair volumizing powder

1181
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,650
I didn't bring any hair volumizing powder

1182
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,790
Smile

1183
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,089
Junrong, my bangs are too short, they
can't reach behind my ears Xiumin: Hmm

1184
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,490
Junrong, my bangs have
grown to this length as well

1185
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,830
Xiumin, just use an electric
curling iron, it can create curls.

1186
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,740
JaeJae laughed too.

1187
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,379
Chuu's heart is pounding.

1188
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,779
JaeJae, is Xiumin angry or something?

1189
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,980
JaeJae, is Xiumin feeling
excited now? Or is she angry?

1190
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,490
Junrong, why aren't you drinking any drinks?
Not eating anything? Xiumin, it's just...

1191
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,290
Xiumin, you know what I
mean, I feel a little strange.

1192
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:25,629
Junrong Why is it strange? Xiumin
There are complex reasons... factors

1193
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,499
Junrong What complex factors?

1194
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,630
Complex factors are

1195
00:57:28,631 --> 00:57:34,309
Xiumin Firstly, there is a guy next to me
That guy is tall and handsome and... um...

1196
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:38,440
Xiumin And he is also a model, so I feel
like I shouldn't eat too much. The end!

1197
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,680
What are you talking about?
I'm not really sure either.

1198
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,660
Suimin: Well... my
ideal type is a tall guy.

1199
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:53,090
Junrong: Have you ever seen
someone who is 190 cm tall?

1200
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,460
Suimin: No, I haven't.
Junrong: What do you think?

1201
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,500
Suimin: I feel like we
are from different races (?)

1202
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,370
Junrong: It's all the same.

1203
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,809
Suimin: But it's so beautiful.
Junrong: Is the ocean beautiful?

1204
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,850
Suimin: The way it reflects and
shines in the sunlight is so beautiful.

1205
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,690
Junrong wants to go and see the sea. Do you
want to go to the seaside? Xiumin: Mm-hmm!

1206
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,919
Junrong: The sun is higher than I
imagined, isn't it? Xiumin: That's right.

1207
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,830
Junrong: The sun is about to set now.

1208
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,160
Xiumin: But I...

1209
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,270
Xiumin: I prefer sunrise and
also like the slightly shining sun.

1210
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,870
Junrong: Are you okay?

1211
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,280
Xiumin: Have I been sinking all along?

1212
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,650
Junrong Every step I take, I sink a little
deeper. Xiumin Yeah, always sinking to the side.

1213
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:52,350
- Should I hold on?
- Hmm, okay, because I...

1214
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,650
Should I hold on?
- Should I hold on?
- Hmm, okay, because I...

1215
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,870
- Should I hold on?
- Hmm, okay, because I...

1216
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:59,710
Have we held hands?

1217
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,890
Chuu What's going on?

1218
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,830
Are you linking arms?

1219
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,060
- Can we do it like that, like that?
- Linked arms. Chuu Can we do it like that? Like that?

1220
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,740
JaeJae Of course it's possible.
- Can we do it like that, like that?
- Linked arms. Chuu Can we do it like that? Like that?

1221
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,259
JaeJae Of course it's possible.

1222
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,580
JaeJae Why not? Who said it's
not possible? Who said that?

1223
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,300
Su Min It seems that height really matters.

1224
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:20,150
Jun Rong It's really beautiful. Su
Min Yeah, really... That was close.

1225
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,580
Su Min I've always
wanted to go see the sea.

1226
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,279
Su Min Should we write our names later? Jun Rong
Should we write that one? Draw a heart shape.

1227
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,360
Hmm.

1228
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,930
Junrong, how is this? Xiumin,
not bad, it looks very sturdy.

1229
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:50,410
Junrong, I'm not very good at
drawing. Xiumin, you draw very well.

1230
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,210
The boy drew a heart.

1231
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,350
The girl continues to fill in.
I just took a very nice photo.

1232
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,320
Is it nice?

1233
01:00:02,321 --> 01:00:02,650
Xiumin, is it nice? Junrong, it kind
of looks like the North Korean era...

1234
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:03,960
- A little... - Hmm
Xiumin, is it nice? Junrong, it kind
of looks like the North Korean era...

1235
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,180
Xiumin, is it nice? Junrong, it kind
of looks like the North Korean era...

1236
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,790
- It feels like the era of North Korea...
- Hmm
Xiumin, is it nice? Junrong, it kind
of looks like the North Korean era...

1237
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:06,490
- It feels like the era of North Korea...
- Hmm

1238
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:08,590
Joon Rong, a person who reads books

1239
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,330
Very good, very good

1240
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,130
Joon Rong, look a little
more towards my side

1241
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,040
Joon Rong, very good, just like that

1242
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,539
Xiu Min, don't you think the
handwriting looks really nice?

1243
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,620
Xiu Min, Joon Rong Joon Rong, it's the first time
I've seen someone write so beautifully on the beach.

1244
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:28,810
Xiumin has a lot of seashells.
Junrong, do you like seashells?

1245
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,150
Xiumin doesn't like seashells,
she likes the seashells on the beach.

1246
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:37,590
Junrong: Are they very beautiful? Like
the stars in the night sky? Xiumin: Yes.

1247
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,960
Xiumin: There are too many
stars, they are about to overflow.

1248
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,700
Junrong: Are they shooting stars?

1249
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:47,206
Xiumin: Did you find any nice ones? What's
wrong? Have you found something nice?

1250
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,750
Petite and fair, very much like you.
- Petite and fair, very much like you. - Ah, really?

1251
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,109
What made you think of such words?

1252
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,109
JaeJae, petite and fair,
very much like you...

1253
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,750
Xiu Min, I'm taking you to the rest area.

1254
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,940
Over there.

1255
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,430
Jun Rong, sit here. Xiu Min: Okay.

1256
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,660
Xiumin, can this clothing be
placed here? Junrong: Of course.

1257
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,670
Xiumin: The model actually
sacrificed the clothing. Thank you.

1258
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,109
Junrong: Ah, the dress... Xiumin:
It's okay, it's okay. It's a long dress.

1259
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:38,220
Junrong: Is it a long dress? Is
it okay? It still covers, right?

1260
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,740
Junrong: Is my current hairstyle
still acceptable? Xiumin: Mmm!

1261
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,120
Showmin: Actually, being wet also looks good. Styled
up also looks good. Even a flat top looks good.

1262
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,200
Actually, being wet also looks
good. Styled up also looks good.
Showmin: Actually, being wet also looks good. Styled
up also looks good. Even a flat top looks good.

1263
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:50,570
Showmin: Actually, being wet also looks good. Styled
up also looks good. Even a flat top looks good.

1264
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,500
- Even a flat top looks good.
- A flat top...
Showmin: Actually, being wet also looks good. Styled
up also looks good. Even a flat top looks good.

1265
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:52,650
- Even a flat top looks good.
- A flat top...

1266
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,250
Showmin: Can I ask a childish question? It's
a cruel game of choosing one out of two.

1267
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,820
- Can I ask a childish question? - Sure.
Showmin: Can I ask a childish question? It's
a cruel game of choosing one out of two.

1268
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,080
Showmin: Can I ask a childish question? It's
a cruel game of choosing one out of two.

1269
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,440
- It's a cruel game of choosing one out of two.
- Hmm.
Showmin: Can I ask a childish question? It's

1270
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:01,910
- It's a cruel game of choosing one out of two.
- Hmm.

1271
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,710
IVE Ansu vs IVE Lee Ray.
IVE's Anyuzhen and Li Rui

1272
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:09,750
Junrong likes Zhang Yuanying the
most Xiumin: Oh really? That's amazing

1273
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:14,789
JaeJae: What's so amazing?
You guys are such funny kids

1274
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,019
JaeJae: Xiumin didn't ask Zhang Yuanying and who at first - Xiumin
didn't ask Zhang Yuanying and who at first - Yeah, that's right

1275
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,519
JaeJae: Anyuzhen and Li Rui

1276
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,290
So cute!

1277
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,030
Xiumin, what was your first
impression of me? I'm really curious.

1278
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,640
- First impression... When we first introduced ourselves.
- Hmm. Junrong, first impression? When we first introduced ourselves.

1279
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,010
I knew it was you at first sight.

1280
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,950
Junrong, but it's a bit
difficult to get to know you well.

1281
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:46,079
Junrong, I have a lively personality.
- My personality is more lively - Hmm

1282
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,380
Junrong doesn't think it's difficult for two people
to be together, Being together is very relaxing...

1283
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,176
Don't think it's difficult
for two people to be together.
Junrong doesn't think it's difficult for two people
to be together, Being together is very relaxing...

1284
01:02:48,176 --> 01:02:48,200
Junrong doesn't think it's difficult for two people
to be together, Being together is very relaxing...

1285
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,359
- Being together is very relaxing - Hmm
Junrong doesn't think it's difficult for two people
to be together, Being together is very relaxing...

1286
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:50,360
Junrong doesn't think it's difficult for two people
to be together, Being together is very relaxing...

1287
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,659
Junrong, but being
with you is very awkward.

1288
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:58,999
Junrong, should I say I feel anxious? It's very
awkward, so it feels like I need to do something.

1289
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Junrong became stranger and
stranger, and then stopped.

1290
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,840
Xiumin, I used to think that my
brother is a cold-hearted person.

1291
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,680
Junrong, a cold-hearted person... Xiumin,
in my impression, is very cold-hearted.

1292
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:16,749
Xiumin, compared to warm-hearted
people, I prefer cold-hearted people?

1293
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:23,019
Junrong, a reverse charm? Xiumin, yes,
cold-hearted people often have warm hearts.

1294
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,160
Junrong Am I as well? Xiumin Hmm.

1295
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:33,086
Xiumin If you ask me what I like, there are times when I'm in a bad mood.
- If you ask me what I like, there are times when I'm in a bad mood. - Hmm.

1296
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,270
- The day we came back from
the date - After the date

1297
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,840
Because of a misunderstanding, Dongxu
and Xiumin had a little argument that day.
- The day we came back from
the date - After the date

1298
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,500
Because of a misunderstanding, Dongxu
and Xiumin had a little argument that day.

1299
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,060
You and Dongxu seem off.

1300
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,770
I was a bit tired at the time.

1301
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,130
My older brother saw
me coming back and said,

1302
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:45,440
Junrong comforted me with
a sentence, "Princess."

1303
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,776
- The princess is back.
- The princess is back.
Junrong comforted me with
a sentence, "Princess."

1304
01:03:46,776 --> 01:03:46,800
Junrong comforted me with
a sentence, "Princess."

1305
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,280
- Thank you for saying that. - Really?
Junrong comforted me with
a sentence, "Princess."

1306
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:48,410
- Thank you for saying that. - Really?

1307
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,020
I feel much better now.

1308
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,720
I can feel that you are a good person.

1309
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,359
Xiumin, if my brother
didn't say those words!

1310
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,660
Xiumin, maybe I would have left!

1311
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,199
Xiumin, we don't have
many opportunities to chat.

1312
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,020
Hmm.

1313
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,430
Xiumin, I always want to
know more about you, and...

1314
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:14,640
Xiumin, although I also thought about it
today, it would be nice if it was Dongxu.

1315
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:20,210
But I also thought it would be nice if
it was you, my brother, so I'm quite happy.

1316
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:27,950
Junrong, actually until yesterday, because I saw that you
had stuffed the one with Dongxu's on the back of your phone.

1317
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,460
Junrong, it seems to have become like
this, so I just wanted to say forget it.

1318
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,670
On the back of Xiumin's
phone is a photo of Dongxu.

1319
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,230
Junrong, you said you would
take a photo with me, remember?

1320
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:50,840
Xiumin: How about taking it tomorrow? I
don't want to show my face to clients today.

1321
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:52,180
Junrong: Not seeing clients today?
Xiumin: Yeah, I won't see clients today.

1322
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,260
Not seeing clients today?
Junrong: Not seeing clients today?
Xiumin: Yeah, I won't see clients today.

1323
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:53,440
Junrong: Not seeing clients today?
Xiumin: Yeah, I won't see clients today.

1324
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,350
- Yeah, not seeing clients today.
- Not seeing clients.
Junrong: Not seeing clients today?
Xiumin: Yeah, I won't see clients today.

1325
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:54,590
- Yeah, not seeing clients today.
- Not seeing clients.

1326
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,210
Xiumin: Exceeded the limit.

1327
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,750
Junrong couldn't get any closer to Xiumin.

1328
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,259
Junrong: So, actually, this morning too...
Didn't you say that I didn't look very happy?

1329
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:09,360
Junrong: It's true... I wasn't very happy.

1330
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,359
Junrong: It's just...

1331
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:19,400
Junrong: Because I haven't really been in this kind
of situation before, I don't know how to treat you.

1332
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,509
Junrong: So, I'm even more... I mean...

1333
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:26,080
Junrong: Am I more indifferent than others?

1334
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,850
Junrong: I really didn't expect it
to be a date with you. Xiumin: I see.

1335
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,790
Junrong: When I went out, I
kept watching Dongxu's expression.

1336
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:43,360
Junrong: But I also feel whether
I shouldn't have done that.

1337
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:51,640
So I think it's right to
honestly express my feelings.

1338
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:57,340
I've decided not to quarrel with you.

1339
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,080
Zhenglie: It's announced! It's
announced as a love triangle.

1340
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,220
JaeJae: Junrong is an honest person.
Yeah, Junrong is really an honest person.

1341
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,290
Yeah, Junrong is really an honest person.

1342
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:11,920
Jun Rong, I feel much better now.
Xiu Min: Hmm, so that's how it is.

1343
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,360
That was a time exclusively for me. The
young man is no longer hiding his feelings.

1344
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:25,070
Jun Rong, because she didn't
completely reject my feelings,

1345
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:31,110
there's also a little bit
of a fluttering feeling...

1346
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:35,650
Xiu Min: Hmm...

1347
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,420
Xiu Min: Hmm...

1348
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,759
Xiu Min: Ah, I feel like my
thoughts are starting to multiply.

1349
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,490
Jun Rong: Why? Why? Xiu
Min: Hmm... just because.

1350
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,069
Show Min, to be honest, Jun Rong gege pays
attention to small details when dealing with me.

1351
01:06:56,070 --> 01:07:00,270
Show Min, it makes me feel that
he is considerate and very charming.

1352
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:04,040
Show Min, my mood...

1353
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,980
Show Min, ah, wait a moment...

1354
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:24,200
Like the wind blowing the waves.

1355
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:27,670
Show Min, my mood is strange.

1356
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:32,040
Even a girl's heart is blown by the wind.

1357
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,940
Show Min, hah...

1358
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:37,160
Junrong, do you want to go
back? Xiumin, I must take a photo.

1359
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,580

on someone of the opposite sex?

01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,590
Is that so?

But we can't give up here.

Xiu Min, yeah, this hand of mine
doesn't cover my older brother.

1393
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:42,969
I'm a little worried.

1394
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:44,809
Jun Rong, I expressed
myself and you also...

1395
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,179

1396
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,509
Dong Xu, are you going
to leave me here alone?

1397
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,770
Xiu Min, can't you stay?

1398
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,180

Why can't I speak in front of him anymore?
Another relationship still entangled

1402
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,659
It seems that I really am a fool, Xiumin

1403
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,229
Liyuan, let's go see what
Huicheng is doing, shall we?

01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:04,729
Liyuan, is there nobody here?

1405

Look, we're the only ones looking for
someone Looking for Hui Cheng's Liyuan.

Is it this?

1407
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,169
Liyuan is Hui Cheng's voice?

1411
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,979
Xiumin, why are they two together?
Liyuan seems to be chatting.

Dongxu Probably not possible, right?

1420
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,229
Xiumin, are you angry? Liyan: No, I'm not.

1421
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,160
Xiumin, are you jealous?
Liyan: No, I'm not.
