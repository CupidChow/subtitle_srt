[Kang laughing]

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,555
That you killed your husband,

and he's back now?

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,185

32
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,298
You looked so miserable
that day at the café

33
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,592
when you broke the cup
and spilled ice all over.

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,636
You must feel so much better now.

35
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,389
Since you murdered your husband.

36
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,725
I don't know what you're talking about.

-My husband should be home any minute.
-Who? Jin-pyo?

The last time I was here,

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,443
I dragged his body out.

40
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,988
Like this, right? It was a challenge.

41
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,283
Jin-pyo in a fucking suitcase.
His body was heavy as hell.

Stop. Cut it out.

54

Do you know how much it cost me
to restore this thing?

What are you doing here?

56
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,645

Open it.

62

I don't know the combination.

63
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,127
Try one.

Open it by tomorrow.

71
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,329
I'll be needing…

72
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,624
three billion won.

73
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,459
What?

74
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,129
You and Jo Eun-su murdered your husband.

75
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,756
You'll want me to keep quiet.

76
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,221
You've got it wrong.
Eun-su had nothing to do with it.

77
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,807
Three billion.

78
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,104
I don't have any money.

Really?

81
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,901
Then I guess I should go talk to Jin-young

82
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,486
down at the police station.

Having a talk with her

I thought you wanted money.

93
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,928
Pick up.

94
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,930
Tell her to piss off.

95
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,974
She'll know I'm not okay.

96
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,851
She'll hear it in my voice.

97
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,854
She might call the police.

98
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,734

Now you're getting it.

It's fine. I'll avoid cameras.

No one will notice me.

Sorry I didn't answer. I was washing up.

Did you have a bubble bath or something?

Has Jin-pyo called yet?

119

I call her the second I saw you.

[So-baek yawns]

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,313
Morning, Mr. Jin.

194
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,901
Hui-su's late? That's not like her?

195
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,070
She's taken a load
off your shoulders lately, huh?

196
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,908
[phone buzzing]

197
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,287
[phone buzzing]

198
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,166
-Hi, what's up?
-[Eun-su] Yes, hello. Mr. Jin?

199
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,544
-Has Hui-su come in today?
-Not yet.

200
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,212
She's running late.

201
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,050
Okay, and would you happen to know
where Mr. Jang Kang is staying?

202
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,471
Jang Kang?

203
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,931
Yeah, but never mind.

204
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,560
Could you please tell Hui-su
to give me a call when she gets to work?

205
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,978
Thanks so much.

206
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,104
[disconnect tone]

207
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,231
What was that?

208
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,739
Morning, Mr. Jin.

209
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,035
Hey, uh… [coughs]

210
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,538
Did you hear Jang Kang's back?

211
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,082
Oh? How'd you know?

212
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,043
I heard he got back two days ago,
but I haven't seen him yet.

213
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,301
[pensive music playing]

214
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,851
[music fades]

215
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,443
Sorry, do you have a phone charger?

216
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,528
[man] Yeah. Sure. I'll plug it in.

217
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,954
[phone buzzing]

218
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,875
Oh, uh, it's ringing.
Could I get it back, please?

219
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,543
[man] Of course, no problem.

220
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,927

[breathes heavily]

222
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,265
Hello?

223
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,938
I opened the safe.

224
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:42,983
Yes.

225
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,701
[Jin-young] Mom. Hi.

226
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,081
What's the matter?

227
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:57,998
What is it?

228
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:58,916
Come here.

229
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,126
I can't be away too long.

230
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,881
The security guard
at Jin-pyo's place died.

231
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,424
So what?

232
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,010
Look into it.

233
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,136
Ugh, I'm busy.

234
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,221
It's just…

235
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:18,811
I'd actually asked
that very guard to keep an eye on Hui-su.

236
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,146
Ugh, Ma!

237
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,357
She seems really off to me.

238
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,317
Why would you say that?

239
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,987
-Jin-pyo's the one being weird.
-Hey!

240
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,906
How dare you compare the two!

241
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,078
You don't find it strange that she hasn't
worked in forever and suddenly got a job?

242
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,163
She's been acting like
she doesn't mind he's gone.

243
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,791
Oh, Mom, why are you being like this?

244
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,252
[elevator bell dings]

245
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,755
[Eun-su] Hui-su!

246
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,508
Where were you? Your phone wasn't on.

247
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,426
Oh.

248
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,429
-[elevator] Stand clear of closing doors.
-I forgot to plug it in.

249
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,807
God, you should've called last night.
I would've rushed over here.

250
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,101
You've done so much.

251
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,562
[sighs] You're okay though, right?

252
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,605
Mm-hmm.

253
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,691
[sighs] Thank God.

254
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,532
This won't be enough for Jang Kang.

255
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
So what are you gonna do?

256
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,163
I'll put my mom's house up
for urgent sale.

257
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,873
I'll put this place up too.

258
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,043
I'll get as much money as possible
to get him to leave.

259
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,462
What if he comes back?

260
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,299
What if, after everything you give him,
he comes back to threaten you again?

261
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,886
-I'm gonna meet him and settle this.
-No, please don't.

262
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,806
-How can he ask for three billion won?
-Just stay out of it.

263
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,892
[uneasy music playing]

264
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,522
What, Hui-su?

265
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,275
Jang Kang.

266
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,613
He is way more terrifying
than you imagine.

267
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,119
He's the one who

268
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,790
killed that security guard.

269
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,129
[guard] The detectives
who came by this morning

270
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,673
already went through
all of Mr. Kim's stuff.

271
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,636
I found something else.
Just now, it was in here.

272
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,096
Pretty sure it was his.

273
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,722
Oh, okay.

274
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,723
Right.

275
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,267
[guard sighs]

276
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,771
-[woman] Hello, sir.
-Yes?

277
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,148
[woman] I live in unit 703.

278
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,360
I was wondering about
the pest control scheduled for next week.

279
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,820
Which block are you starting with?

280
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,405
Is there any way my place
could be done before 9:00 a.m.?

281
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,742
[guard] Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am.
We hired a private company to do it,

282
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,371
and it's against building policy
for them to start before 9:00.

283
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,456
[chattering continues indistinctly]

284
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,258
[Gyeong-gu] Oh? Jin-young.

285
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,717
[sobs]

286
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,760
[Eun-su] I get it.

287
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,513
I wouldn't have called 119
about the guard either.

288
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,430
[sobs]

289
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,933
We need to focus on Jang Kang for now.

290
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,601
He can try to blackmail you.

291
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,895
But the truth is,
he has no evidence at all.

292
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,524
There's no way Jin-pyo's phone
will provide his whereabouts. Don't worry.

293
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,860
[mysterious music playing]

294
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,112
He can't risk meeting
with Jin-pyo's sister.

295
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,240
The minute he shows his face,
he'll have to give up on the money.

296
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,201
He can't come back here either.

297
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,416
What happened to the guard
was really tragic. I know.

298
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,378
But pretty soon, Jang Kang is gonna have
no other choice but to lay low.

299
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,715
But Eun-su, I--

300
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,716
No, we.

301
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,264
Mm-hmm.

302
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,354
[Gyeong-gu] This is my first case since
I transferred to the Violent Crimes Unit.

303
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,440
What a surprise
running into you like this.

304
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,566
I know, right?

305
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,903
I was at my brother's and figured
I should come see about the incident.

306
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,823
Well, um, I'm finding it really strange
the cameras didn't get any images.

307
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,284
Uh, I know the video quality
is never great,

308
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,536
but the drizzle last night
only made it worse.

309
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,999
[Gyeong-gu sighs]

310
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,042
Here.

311
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,085
You missed this.

312
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,879
What? Oh man!

313
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,839
Where'd you get this? Thanks so much.

314
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,926
Damn. How did I overlook something
so important?

315
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,219
[phone buzzing]

316
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,596
Yes, hello?

317
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,140
-I gotta take this, okay?
-Mm.

318
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,850
Yes, I'm looking into it now.

325
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,932
[Jin-young] Hmm?

326
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,685
-There isn't much to see, huh?
-Hmm.

327
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,353
Yeah.

how to dodge the cameras.

What?

00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,407
Huh?

333
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,368
Oh! You're right!

334
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,620
Yeah, totally.
Man, you really are the best.

Hey, do you have a minute?

336
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,125
Remember what I asked for last time?

337
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,252

Scared people will think Jin-pyo's here?

364
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,803
Follow me.

365
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,472
[Kang] Listen, honey.

366
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,310
You think you can give me orders?

367
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,187
You're a killer.

368
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,523
Are you nuts?

369
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,483
[chuckles]

370
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,572
Someone's over there watching us.

371
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,160
If you want your money, follow me.

372
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,705
-Hello Eun-su.
-Hello.

373
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,500
Oh, hello.
Are you here to look at necklaces?

374
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,923
Oh, hell yeah.

375
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,509
-[woman] Pardon?
-He's kidding around.

376
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,635
This way, sir.

377
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,346
[laughing]

378
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,348
[Eun-su] Excuse us.

379
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,269
Take the red-eye to China tonight.

380
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,353
[Kang] Nah.

381
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,605
Chill out, will ya?

382
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,317
I don't give a damn about Jin-pyo.
He's already dead.

383
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,611
What do you mean he's dead?
Can you prove it?

384
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,449
[laughs]

385
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,993
I knew you wanted to whack the guy.

386
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:18,373
He beat her, kept her under surveillance,
and tracked her location.

387
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,503
You two thought you were so smart.

388
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,176
Thing is, you had no clue the prick
was tracking his wife's every move.

389
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,136
Huh?

390
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,724
-[tense music playing]
-[Hui-su grunts]

391
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,811
Just give me his phone.

392
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,772
No, I want the money first.

393
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,901
Hand it over, or I'll report you
for murdering the security guard.

394
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,569
So what if you report me?

395
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,615
Think I won't drag you down? Think I won't
tell them about you and your friend?

396
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,366
What would you get from doing that anyway?

397
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,286
If we get arrested, remember,
you won't get any money.

398
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,206
Oh yeah.

399
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,084
I'll adjust my fee to include the phone.

400
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,461
3.1 billion.

401
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,754
[groans]

402
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,465
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

403
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,967
This is how scared
you should've been all along.

404
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,720
Shouldn't have underestimated me,
you know?

405
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,062
[woman 2] Ms. Eun-su.

406
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,064
-[Eun-su] Yes?
-She's waiting for you.

407
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,483
[music fades]

408
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,779
KO JEONG-SUK’S BY YOUR SIDE

409
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,073
Oh, hello, Mrs. Ko.
It's an honor to meet you.

410
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,492
-Thank you, dear.
-I'm a huge fan of yours.

411
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,868
-Hello.
-I've read all your books.

412
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,788
-I… I love them all.
-So lovely to hear. Thank you.

413
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,957
Oh, I… I just love her.

414
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,003
-[woman 3] Mrs. Ko. I'm such a fan.
-Nice to meet you. Sure.

415
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,547
-It's so wonderful to meet you.
-Yes.

416
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,090
May I take a picture with you?

417
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,299
Of course.

418
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,634
[woman 3 chuckles]

419
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,885
You know, my friend,

420
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,555
her marriage has improved so much
thanks to you.

421
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,390
But unfortunately,
she couldn't make it today.

422
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,517
-[Jeong-suk] I see. Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

423
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,894
-Thank you.
-[woman 4] Hello, Mrs. Ko.

424
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,354
-I'm such a fan.
-[Jeong-suk] Hello.

425
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,439
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

426
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,441
-Yes. Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

427
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,652
[phone buzzes]

428
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,492
[Kang] Mom, I'm on the run.

429
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,416
[Jeong-suk] Where are you?

430
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,377
I'm out of money, Mom.
I need you to send me some.

431
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,344
[Jeong-suk] For the most part,

432
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,640
these remarks only worsen the relationship
rather than resolve the problem.

433
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,559
Why do you think that is?

434
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,313
It's because we fail to understand
the other person's intention

435
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,065
and focus instead
on their choice of words.

436
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:53,653
Conversation is the process
of understanding each other's intentions.

437
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,032
But we often start to talk
in a defensive mood.

438
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,954
A married couple
is the beating heart of the family.

439
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,041
If we understand
how the other expresses themselves.

440
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,336
And keep that in mind during
the more challenging conversations…

441
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,880
[Kang] You need to keep me
and the money a secret.

442
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,549
And don't text back. I'll be in touch.

443
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,885
[Jeong-suk] …that communicate effectively
with each other

444
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,095
and share activities and experiences

445
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,556
will have received
the world's greatest gift.

446
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,892
-Hey, lady.
-[Jeong-suk] Everyone, please…

447
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,143
Keep this secret.

448
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,480
-It's our secret. Okay?
-[Jeong-suk] It begins with one remark.

449
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,026
It is crucial to learn
how to listen, empathize with,

450
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,737
and understand each other's intentions.

451
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,407
Um, Mr. Chairman,

452
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,493
do you think you can perhaps refer me

453
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,953
to a trustworthy agency
to handle something?

454
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,499
It's not for me.
I'm asking for a client I care for.

455
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,752
[intriguing music playing]

456
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,671
Certainly.

457
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,424
Safe travels, sir.

458
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,098
[music fades]

459
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,184
[man] Hey, Jang Kang. You're here.

460
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,311
You really came back, huh?

461
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,731
Mr. Wi.

462
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,984
If you were gonna come back so soon,
why'd you leave at all?

463
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,444
And, um, where are you staying now?

464
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,489
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Taste some of this.

465
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,119
Here. Have a bite, yeah?
It's on me, okay? Eat up. [laughs]

466
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,125
Ah, don't mention it. It's been ages.
I'll give you a sundae too.

467
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,293
Ma'am, a sundae for my friend.

468
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,670
Ha. Here.

469
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,171
-Eat up.
-I don't want any.

470
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,800
[Kang] Give me the bill, lady.

471
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,305
Wh… what?

472
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,183
Keep the change.
It'll cover whatever this guy orders.

473
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,187
Hey, Wi.

474
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,899
-We should get a drink.
-Uh… Oh, okay.

475
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,658
Hey, go easy on them, huh?

476
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,994
-[man] This guy's a shark.
-[woman] He's an expert.

477
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,370
[indistinct chatter]

478
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,504
Hey, those look good.

479
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,850
[man] Mr. Ma, the manager
of the private detective agency,

480
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,226
isn't here today.

481
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,563
If he shows up,
tell him that if a Jo Eun-su should call,

482
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,524
he should assign his best guy to the job.

483
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,110
Jo Eun-su?

484
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,321
[man 2] Sir, it's your turn now.

485
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,824
[phone buzzing]

486
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,086
[muffled club music playing]

487
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,213
You're here, sir.

488
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,275
That guy used to move boxes
at your warehouse, right?

489
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,945
He was totally out of control,

490
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,863
so I left him there to drink
till he passed out.

491
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,741
I'm guessing he came into some money.

492
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,244
Why couldn't he just have
a few drinks and take it easy?

493
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,163
I just finished redecorating the place.
This is terrible.

494
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,347
-This should cover the damage.
-Thank you.

495
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,250
[pensive music playing]

496
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,184
[Mr. Wi] He used to save the broth
for instant noodles for later.

497
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,730
Now he's handing out
50,000 won bills to escorts.

498
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,815
He used to call me "sir" out of respect.

499
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,151
Now he buys the drinks and acts so rude.

500
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,403
[groans] I get it.

501
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,947
He's supposed to score
three billion won really soon,

502
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,450
so this kind of money
is like a joke to him now.

503
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,534
Three billion?

504
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,370
He mentioned
these two bitches that owe him.

505
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,708
I mean, he's got two women
wrapped around his finger,

506
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,002
and they're gonna give him
the three billion.

507
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,295
[Mr. Wi groans]

508
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,089
He's obviously scamming
or blackmailing them, sir.

509
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,763
Oh shit.

510
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,142
Mr. Jin. [chuckles]

511
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,732
-What the fuck?
-[tense music playing]

512
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,192
Who do you think you are?

513
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,319
You think you can put your hands
on my money?

514
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,699
Huh?

515
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,959
You wrecked the place.
You need to pay, jackass.

516
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,711
Also,

517
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,507
you're in some new business, huh?

518
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,803
You wouldn't want the cops to come get you
for entering the country illegally.

519
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,888
[laughing]

520
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,976
Fuck, man.
What makes you think I got in illegally?

521
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,187
I have a passport. Actually, I have two.

522
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,189
There's mine and another guy's.

523
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,236
Make this fucking asshole pay
for the damage and give me my cash now.

524
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,115
Now!

525
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,533
Huh?

526
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,623
-[So-baek] Watch it.
-[grunts]

527
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,920
[laughing]

528
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,966
See you when you sober up, loser.
Let's go.

529
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,051
-Yes, sir.
-Where the fuck do you think you're going?

530
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,261
[grunts]

531
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,055
[Kang groans]

532
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,515

-Not at all, sir. I'm fine.

What can they do
if there's no body to prove it?

563
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,793
Make sure no one knows you did it,
or make sure no one knows he's dead.

564
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,590
That's why Eun-su hired Jang Kang.

I have a passport.

There's mine and another guy's.

you're applying here?

Yeah.

Sir, could you get some intel on someone?

00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,635
A location tracker?

577
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,263
Good news is I don't think Jang Kang
knows where Jin-pyo's body is.

578
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,184
We need to get that phone from him
before he figures it out.

I'll bring you the money.

Uh, no, nothing much.
I didn't mean anything by it.

705

00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,643
I'll call you later, Jin-young.

710
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,436
All right, goodbye.

711
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,604
[disconnect tone]

712
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,399
[sighs]

713
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,361
[sighs] Oh shit.

714
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,989
I've got the interview tomorrow.

715
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,869
Gotta get rid of the dashcam footage.

716
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,704
[tires squeal]

717
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,330
[phone ringing]

718
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,332
MOM

719
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,169
-Mom, can I call you back? I'm busy--
-Your brother was here.

720
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,046
[tires squeal]

721
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,968
He has some terrible people after him.

722
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,637
He came to see me,
but he had to keep his distance.

723
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,474
Anyway, find your brother
and bring him home

724
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,810
before his office gets to him.

725
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,355
I've been rereading his messages
for the past two days.

726
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,940
I'm worried sick.

727
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,901
Messages?

728
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,948
MOM, I'M ON THE RUNN

729
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,491
I'M OUT OF MONEE

730
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,243
NOONE CAN NO ABOUT THE MONEE OR ME

731
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,329
[tense music continues]

732
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,376
JIN-PYO

733
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,380
I'M HAVING DINNER WITH MOM TONIGHT
YOU CAN MAKE IT, RIGHT?

734
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,469
Jin-pyo didn't send any of these.

735
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,263
[groans]

736
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,183
[groans] Where are we?

737
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,773
We almost there?

738
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,069
Hey.

739
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,740
How much longer till we get there?

740
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,376
Where are we going?

741
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,589
Huh?

742
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,510
[sighs]

743
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,720
Let me out.

744
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,100
Just stop the car!

745
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,893
-Let go!
-Fucking bitch!

746
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,520
-[tires squeal]
-[Eun-su] Stop it!

747
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,272

-You bitch!
-[grunts]

752
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,454
I told you to pull over.
You almost got us both killed. Huh? Huh?

753
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,789
[Eun-su groans]

754
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,958
I could kill you right now.

755
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,293
But I want my fucking money.

756
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,337
Pay up or die.

757
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,131
[both grunt]

758
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,675
[Eun-su] Wait!

759
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,179
Get the fuck off me!

760
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,973

[breathing heavily]

763
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,318
Where the fuck are we?

764
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,572
[music fades]

765
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,788
[tires squealing]

766
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,335
[Kang breathing heavily]

767
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,050
[breathing heavily]

768
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,562
[ominous music playing]

769
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,233
[breathing heavily]

770
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,780
[tense music swells]

771
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,822

772
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,908
