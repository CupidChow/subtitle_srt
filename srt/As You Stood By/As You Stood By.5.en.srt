00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,345
Let's do this before the ambulances come.

-[officer taps trunk]
-I need you to open the trunk, ma'am.

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,690
Open up.

00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,946

-Uh, coming, sir.

[Eun-su] Sure you don't need me
to come up with you?

17
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,887
[Hui-su] Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,473
Okay.

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,227
Just make yourself some soup,
then try to get some rest.

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,229
You too.

00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,023

[woman 1] The polar bear…

32
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,740
[man] A good stance is important,

33
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,701
as it provides a solid base
for generating power. Feet should be…

34
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,162

Typically, you find…

[channels changing]

37
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,005
[man] The questions
we need to ask ourselves

38
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,798
are why are you letting him
get into trouble,

39
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,051
and why would you let her go
to that place alone?

40
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,262
[woman] She said she was going home
because she wanted to rest.

41
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,306
[man] But you should have known
she was lying.

42
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,933
She told you what you wanted to hear,

43
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,644
and you didn't think
to check if it was true.

44
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,520
[woman] I was an idiot.

45
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,774
[man 2] We both were, and one of us
is out of a job because of it.

46
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,568
[man] You hated that job anyway,
so no big loss.

47
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,153
[woman] But now she won't talk to us.

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,084
[man on TV] When I finally
did come to my senses,

60
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,044
time had already flown by.

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,090
Everyone else seemed to be
living their lives to the fullest,

62
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,468
while I seemed to be stuck in place.

63
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,638
That's when I realized
that nothing changes

64
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,015
if you don't do anything.

65
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,561
One day, I noticed
that the waterway of my life

66
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,354
had already changed.

67
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,150
Of course, our paths may become rough,

68
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,444
or we may run into obstacles,

69
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,031
and there may be twists and turns
on the way,

70
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,160
but if I keep flowing on my own way,
I'm sure I'll end up somewhere.

71
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,079
Whoever I find myself
to be at the end of that path…

72
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,628
[sighs]

73
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,727

I wouldn't take on Mom's habits.

79
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,203
He isn't there today?

[sniffles]

81
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,378
He didn't go to the office today?

82
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,797
[woman] You weren't aware either, ma'am?

83
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,714
[gasps]

84
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,760
Please contact us as soon as
you get in touch with Mr. Noh.

85
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,304
Yes, of course.

JIN-PYO'S OFFICE

87
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,812
Has my brother checked in with you?

88
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,191
What about his work? Did they call you?

[sighs]

90
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,572
Why?

91
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,198
What is it?

92
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,702
I noticed his passport is missing.

93
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,788
What would he need it for?

94
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,749
I'm not sure,
but his suitcase is gone too.

95
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,044
You think he took a trip
without telling any of us?

96
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,589
Uh, can't really say.

97
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,923
[sighs]

98
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,469
Did you mention these things to his work?

99
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,139
I did when they called a bit earlier.

100
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,934
I'll call in some favors.
If you hear from him, let me know.

101
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,061
Okay.

102
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,365
[sighs]

103
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,413
Hey, you busy?

104
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,043
Yeah, I need you to check
a departure record for me, if you could.

105
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,253
Once they check his departure,

106
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,465
Jin-pyo's office and your sister-in-law
will have to let it go.

107
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,091
It'll work.

108
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,427
Mm.

109
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,930
Mm-hmm.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE CORPSE, 30S

112
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,362
[man 1] He deposited five billion won
a few days before leaving the country,

113
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,406
and then withdrew a portion of it
from his bank.

114
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,243
And it was in his personal account?

115
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,327
-Really?
-[man 1] Yes, sir.

116
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,663
Anything you can tell us
would be very helpful.

117
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,541
Well,

118
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,588
I would say lately,
Mr. Noh was rather obsessed

119
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,590
with bringing a new client on board.

120
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,841
A wealthy artist.

121
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,301
It was shaky at first,

122
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,053
but he did manage to land the account
just before he left.

123
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,556
It's worth five billion.

124
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,686
I can see now that he probably
had this in mind all along.

125
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,565
Using his client's funds to fill
his own account and flee the country.

126
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,319
[man 2] Oh my.

127
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,488
Are you saying
that your deputy branch manager

128
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,117
lured that client
with the intention of stealing her money?

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,002
So you just stood there
and let him walk out the door?

130
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,256
Maybe if I'd been awake when he left,
I would have said something,

131
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,634
but I took some pills to sleep
and didn't hear the alarm.

132
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,594
Why are you using drugs?

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,721
[Jeong-suk sighs]

134
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,848
Even if you slept through it,

135
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,310
why didn't you call anyone
the second you realized he was gone?

136
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,814
Sometimes, Jin-pyo would go
on a weekend with friends

137
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,983
without telling me,
then go straight to work.

138
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,778
-I assumed it was something like that.
-You made yourself eggs?

[Jeong-suk sighs]

140
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,866
And here I am so worried
that I can't eat a thing.

141
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,163
Honey.

142
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,085
[sobs] My son,
what's weighing on you so heavily?

143
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,836
Who did this to you?

144
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,755
Oh.

145
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,590
[sobs]

146
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,092
[uneasy music playing]

147
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,774
Aren't you

148
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,735
even worried he's all right?

149
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,490
[man 1] Getting footage
from Shanghai Airport wasn't easy.

150
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,034
But hey, serve your friends,
serve your country, right?

151
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,452
[sighs]

152
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,080
No way.

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,793
A kid?

154
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,256
[uneasy music continues]

155
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,677
Oh shit.

156
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,597
Another mistress?

157
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,935
[sighs] What the hell is going on?

158
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,645
[phone buzzing]

159
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,024
MOM

160
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:17,987
Hi, Mom.

161
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,321
[sighs]

162
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,573
Hui-su

163
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,242
is unbelievable.

164
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,995
-[sighs]
-She's acting strange.

165
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,205
While I was crying a river
in front of her,

166
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,291
not one single tear fell down her cheek.

167
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,794
You can't just show up at her house.
She's in shock.

168
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,089
-[sighs] And Jin-pyo--
-Did he call?

169
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,967
What about your brother?

170
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
Huh?

171
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,182
[sighs] Jin-pyo walked out on his own,
so leave Hui-su alone.

172
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,225
He'll come crawling back eventually!

173
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,728
-[disconnect tone]
-Wait, Jin…

174
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,064
[sighs]

175
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,193
[sighs]

176
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,652
Embezzlement?

177
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,615
[man 1] We showed Mrs. Jo
the results of our audit yesterday.

178
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:14,126
Uh, I'm just surprised
that you could do an audit so quickly.

[man 1] Since integrity and trust
are paramount to our business,

180
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,925
we've installed a system
that allows us to quickly investigate

181
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,093
any instances of suspected misconduct,

182
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,847
such as potential use of company funds
for personal use.

186
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,117
[man 2] In spite of Mr. Noh's embezzling
client funds and fleeing the country,

187
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,620
we've decided
not to file criminal charges.

188
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,913
In the interest of all parties,

189
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,916
we would prefer to handle the situation
and his dismissal quietly.

190
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,127
We would also like to assure you
that we've taken this decision

191
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,381
after thorough deliberation
and difficult discussions.

192
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:06,178
Is it possible to wait just a bit longer
so he can explain when he gets back?

193

Excuse me.

196
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,988
They're waiting for you upstairs, Mrs. Jo.

197
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,574
Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

198
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,660
[man] I'm told you're a detective?

-You are Mr. Noh's sister?

An Myeong-ho. I work in his department.

201
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,256
I apologize if I'm out of line,
but this situation doesn't make sense.

202
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,466
I think it's worth looking into.

203
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,218
Since you're a detective,
you could find out

204
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,928
if he really did what they say.

205
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll look into it. Thanks for telling us.

206
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,309
Please call me if you have questions.

207
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,518

Uh, I'm not sure
I should listen to those guys.

211
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,472
If you don't, he gets a record.

212
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,892
[sighs] I have no idea
what he was thinking, the idiot.

213
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,019
You got lucky they wanna keep this quiet,

214
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,188
so you don't wanna do anything
to piss them off.

215
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,398
If they press charges, he's done for.

216
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,401
I can't stand how they pretend
that this is hard for them

217
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,737
when all they care about
is their reputation.

218
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,739
It's a blessing in disguise though.

219
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,410
'Cause if the police get involved…
it's over.

220
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,288
Right.

221
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,876
You need to lay low
and not do anything to attract suspicion.

222
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,629
Stick to your routine and stay quiet.

223
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,673
Suspicion?

224
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,801
Your husband took off
after committing embezzlement,

225
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,011
but if you filed for divorce
all of a sudden,

226
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,391
you'd only be drawing more attention,
and they'll think you helped him do it.

227
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,600
You know I didn't.

228
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,185
Yeah, but they don't.

You did so well, Hui-su.

I can't believe it's actually going
like we planned.

You can relax now. It's done.

252
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,490
I almost didn't recognize you.

It's the new Hui-su.

254
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,286
I said let's splurge, and you chose here?

255
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,747
I miss the days
when we came here all the time.

256
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,042
And when their tteokbokki calls your name,
you have to answer.

Yep, absolutely. Come on.

-Really?

[Eun-su] Really.

What?

You interrupt my exercise
to talk about pictures?

287
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,492
It's not enough you give me grief about
your mother, I need to make her smile?

288
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,453
I went through every picture,

289
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,830
from kindergarten to college graduation,

290
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,458
and Mom isn't smiling
in a single one of them.

291
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,836
That says everything
about how badly you've treated her.

292

I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to your silly stories.

293

Go back home to bed.

What you made us live through
affects us to this day.

You terrified us.
Mom and I lived in the hell you created--

You're the one creating hell for me now
with this nonsense about your childhood.

When I'm six feet under,
don't start crying for me then.

Don't you worry.

If you ever put a hand on Mom again,
I will no longer speak to you.

What's going on?

Can we get rid of this thing?

356
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,081
I was never worried
about that money, anyway.

357
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,959
My only concern was word getting out

358
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,753
and my husband finding out
about my sizable slush fund.

359
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,047
It's a good solution for me.

360
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,594
I'm glad it worked out for her.

361
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,848
I would've felt bad
if she had lost everything.

362
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,434
It is good that it all worked out, but

363
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,937
I do feel guilty about taking advantage.

364
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,480
Mm-hmm.

365
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,153
The soup is great, isn't it?

366
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,744
Why do you keep doing that?

367
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,787
Uh, I don't know.

00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,622

I'll hear him coming in the door.

You mean Jin-pyo?

[Hui-su] Mm-hmm.

373
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,777
How would you like
to start illustrating again?

374
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,782
I've thought about it, actually.

375
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,617
Mm-hmm.
You should give your publisher a call.

376
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,576
I need

377
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,579
to start somewhere new.

378
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,831
Where no one knows who I am.

379
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,250
And maybe start a new life for myself.

The work we do here
involves a fair amount of physical labor.

You won't be sitting around,

She's not as fragile as she looks,
and her hands can do magic.

[door opens]

532
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:21,956
Mr. Kwon.

[unsettling music playing]

534
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,876
This is the ladies' room, sir.

535
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,045
I know. My assistant's watching the door.

536
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,423
[water running]

537
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,263
If this is about your wife,
I can't talk to you.

538
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,389
[water stops]

539
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,308
We need to protect my wife's honor.

540
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,813
Suicide caused by domestic violence.

541
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,022
Huh.

542
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,525
Ms. Jo,

543
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,778
you knew her shoe size, nothing else.

544
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,990
I regret not helping her

545
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,534
when I could have.

546
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,786
I'll never forgive myself for that.

547
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,457
So,

548
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,671
you're gonna do something
more regrettable?

549
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,883
I sent you a "thank you."

550
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,264
I intend to testify
and tell the police everything I saw.

551

554
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,319
They'll hear about this too.

-[Seong-cheol] Shit.
-[man] You can't go in there! Hey! Hey!

560
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,009
-[Eun-su] Mr. Jin!

[whimpers]

563
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,355
It seems like I caught you in the act.

564
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,148
Look…

565
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,777
-[Eun-su] Please don't, sir!
-[Seong-cheol grunting]

566
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,113
You wanna take a swing at me,
or say you're good and walk away?

567
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,243
[gasping] Yeah, I'm good. [groans]

568
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,954
Eun-su!

569
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,540
It's all right. I'm okay now.

570
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,211
-Really.
-Are you sure?

571
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,589
[slurping]

572
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,718
[So-baek] Hold on.

573
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,638
He's the reason
I didn't get my hangover soup

574
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,598
or the barbecue that looked so good.

575
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,141
What a big asshole.

576
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,647
You showed up at the right time, sir.

577
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,608
I could use someone like you
to help me run things.

578
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,581
What's your plan? Huh?

579
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,583
What do you wanna do? Talk to me.

580
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,672
I wanna put an end to this.

581
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,757
You're going to the police?

582
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,510
He could come after you again.
It's too dangerous.

583
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,728
[So-baek] She's made up her mind.

584
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,732
I guess you might as well
try to ease your conscience.

585
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,693
Do… do you have to?

586
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,155
It's the only way.

587
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,042
[Hui-su] Here you were
taking care of me when all along…

588
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
you had your own worries.

[sobs]

590
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,512
Oh, no. What…

591
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,271
[Eun-su] Where's all this coming from?

592
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,565
[Hui-su] Ugh, I feel so selfish.
[sniffles]

593
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,359
It's times like these
you need a little clattering.

[mah-jongg tiles clattering]

595
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,701
You'll love this.

596
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,793
-Ooh.
-Wow.

597
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,131
Wanna give it a shot?

598
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,383
Oh…

[Eun-su] Oh!

603
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,463
She does have magic hands.

604
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,385
You know, the sound is relaxing somehow.

605
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,014
Looks like my new hire
has some hidden talents.

606
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,817
[chuckles]

607
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,573
[Eun-su] Why am I the only one
who can't do it?

608
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,616
I'd like to go finish what I was doing.

609
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,660
-Such a hard worker.
-[chuckles]

610
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,670
Jang Kang quitting out of the blue
really left us understaffed, you know?

611
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,507
She won't quit out of the blue, will she?

612
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,094
Course not.

613
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,138
Are you thirsty?

614
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,396
Your calendar seems to be stuck.
It's always the same date.

615
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,731
Don't touch that!

617
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,611
Okay.

-[mah-jongg tiles clattering]
-It's my son's birthday.

619
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,624
And also the day he died.

[mah-jongg tiles slam]

621
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,046
[So-baek] You two should go home.

622
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,176
We'll finish up tomorrow.
Come on, so I can lock up.

623
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,614
I know what it's like to lose a child.

624
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,509
My condolences.

625
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,140
And the same to you.

635
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,546
Yeah.

636
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,805
-[Eun-su] I'll order. You grab us seats.
-Okay.

637
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,225
[reporter] …the man driving the car
was identified as Kwon Seong-cheol,

638
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,603
the victim's husband and wealthy CEO.

639
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,730
Following the incident,
controversy emerged

640
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,776
over whether the victim committed suicide
by running into the car's path, or…

641
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,818
What?

642
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,281
-Someone else got the promotion.
-Huh?

643
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,784
[reporter] The victim is believed
to have taken her own life

644
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,869
due to prolonged domestic abuse.

645
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,412
[woman] Eun-su didn't get it?

646
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,664
[reporter] We bring you
this special report.

647
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,293
[reporter 2] Initially, the incident
was considered a tragic traffic accident,

648
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,545
with the victim's husband
firmly maintaining

649
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,339
that assertion from the beginning.

00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:36,635
VIP SALES TEAM EMPLOYEE TRANSFER

651
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,429
[reporter 2] An acquaintance of the couple
recently testified

652
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,182
that the victim's husband
had been subjecting his wife

653
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,186
to domestic violence and abuse
for many years, and she was in despair.

654
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,605
The police are now reexamining the case

655
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,608
as a potential suicide
due to domestic violence.

656
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,277
The bereaved family
is calling for legal action

657
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,862
against the deceased's husband.

658
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,991
An employee at a local department store
the victim often frequented

00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,036
-Hey, Ma?
-Hmm?

661
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,373
That big dickhead upstairs,
he hasn't been around.

662
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,667
You can't call people names like that.

[scoffs]

664
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,129
You know he deserves it.

665
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,965
And no more music.

666
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,386
I guess he's traveling.

I have the freshest beets for you today.

-Oh.
-They just came in. They'll be delicious.

670
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,195
That's so nice. But no, thanks.

this workshop focuses
on two primary issues

692
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,844
we need to resolve for our field staff.

693
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:09,347
One, enhancing data utilization skills,
and two, improving…

709
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,920

711

[phone buzzing]

712
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,014
Hui-su, everything okay?

713
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,559
[Hui-su] Yeah, sure. Just checking in.

714
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,648
I was just heading out in the rain
to get a few things.

715
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,359
How's the workshop going?

716
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,778
Pretty boring and way too long.

717
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,197
I don't know why it lasts three days.

718
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,908
You must be exhausted. I'm sorry.

719
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,993
Tomorrow's only a half-day at least.

720
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,704
-I can go straight to work after…
-[phone buzzing]

721
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,206
Hold on a minute.

722
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,467
Sorry. This weird, unknown number
keeps trying to call me.

723
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,096
You wanna grab a bite to eat
tomorrow after work?

724
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,597
I can get off early.

725
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,559
[Hui-su] That sounds good.

726
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,812
I hope you won't fall asleep
in your plate.

727
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,525
[guard] Going out in the heavy rain.

728
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,904
Wearing a black coat and pants,
hair loose.

729
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,574
Talking on the phone

730
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,285

[gasps] Oh my God.

738
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,875
[gasps] Who are you?

739
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,877
