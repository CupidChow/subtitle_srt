[GPS voice] You have gone off route.

Can you gift wrap this for me?
I'll take it.

00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,117
Sure.

[phone ringing]

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,914
Hey, Hui-su.
Are you at the restaurant already?

16
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,416
[Hui-su] No, I can't make it.
I'm still at home, Eun-su.

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,836
Why? Are you under the weather?

18
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,380
My publisher wanted to meet last minute.

19
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
[woman on PA] Dear valued customers.

20
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,175
Thank you
for visiting Lavie Department Store.

21
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,261
You said you're still at home though.

22
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,972
[Hui-su] I am. I'll call you tomorrow.

[Eun-su] Yeah.
That's a great idea for the display.

27
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,580
-[man] You like it?
-Mm-hmm, do that.

28
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,666
Your attention, please.

29
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,586
My expectations are very high
for the watch department.

30
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,881
We've given this sales opportunity
to our best team members this year.

31
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:54,883
Good luck, all.

32
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,801
You got this.

33
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,808
-[man 1] Yeah, I really like the new line.
-[man 2] How about this?

34
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,895
An ornate design would look lovely on you.
How about this one?

35
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,772
-[man 3] We'll think about it.
-Very well.

36
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,357
[woman] Thank you.

37
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,324
Do our shops here compare?

38
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:34,672
[chuckles] They do,
but I haven't been back to China in ages.

Sorry, I could tell you're Chinese.
I hope you enjoy living here.

42
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,682
Really nice to meet you.
Would you like to try it on?

43

I haven't told you which one I like yet.

[gentle piano music playing]

45
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,570
This one's part of our premium collection,
set with 90 diamonds.

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,240
It's one of the thinnest
automatic watches ever made.

[light jazz playing]

48
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,218

50
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,931
[sighs] Shame it looks so good on me.

51
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,310
Does it look good?

52
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,980
Well,

53
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,524
I've got better.

54
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,404
I think this collection
will suit you perfectly fine, sir.

55
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,655
Please, take a look.

56
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,117
It doesn't have diamonds.

57
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,495
True, but if you ask me,

58
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,915
the carefully crafted steel case
and band is elegant in and of itself.

59
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,668
No need for gold, platinum, or diamonds.

60
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,169
[man] Hmm.

61
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,298
A man's gotta have diamonds though.

62
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,550
[Eun-su] Yes, of course.

63
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,767
Huh? What's going on?

64
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,478
What's wrong?

65
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,939

68
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,612
The one that's supposed
to be in this spot, it's gone.

69
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,406

[gasps]

71
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,370
It's from the premium limited collection.

72
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,081
The one with diamonds on the bezel.

73
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,499
Uh… Oh…

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,671
Ms. Jo, what should we do?

76
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,423
Oh no! What do we do?

77
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,632
[Eun-su] Just wait a minute.

78
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,844
I'm the only one
who handled that watch today.

79
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,721
You two did nothing wrong.

81
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,434

-[man] Sure.

straight at the security camera.

[man scoffs]

93
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,186
Should we file a police report?

94
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,437
I don't know.

95
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,648
We'll have to inform
the director if we do.

96
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,818
I think I'd rather Ms. Jo
check our invitation list first.

97
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,071
He came as a special guest
of Chairman Ma of Shanghai.

98
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,492
His name won't be on the list.

99
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,578
I think you should try it on.

100
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,624
-Glad to see you, Mr. Chairman.
-Hi, nice to see you.

101
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,336

[forklift beeping]

111
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,290

-[man 2] Two more in the afternoon.

00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,217
[woman] Yeah, I got it right here.

115
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,971
We still have it in stock, no problem.
How many would you like? Three?

116
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,015
[man] I haven't reported it
to the director yet,

117
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,809
so we're not in a position
to go to the police at this point.

118
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,270
For now, just find him
and tell him that we're onto him.

119
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,147
We know he stole the watch.

121
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,325
Excuse me, sir, there's a mistake with
the order we're shipping to Lao Gan Ma.

122
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,661
It's supposed to be ten,
but here it says thirty-five.

123
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,746
Um…

124
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,874
Just do 15. That's what it should've said.

125
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,168
[woman] Fifteen? Perfect.
I'll change the order.

126
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,085
Hello again.

127
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,506
[So-baek] You got here bright and early.
I bet you haven't had breakfast yet.

128
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,342
I know a great haejang-guk place.
I'll treat you.

129
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,677
How about I take the watch,
and the food's on me?

130
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,015
I don't have time to go out to eat,
actually. It's a shame, I'm starving.

131
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,941
Hey, Je-ni!
You gotta check the expiry date!

132
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,321
Please, Mr. Chen Shaobo,

133
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,700
could you show me
the watch you took yesterday?

134
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
What watch?

135
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,995
We're in Korea.

136
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,583
[laughs] Jin So-baek is what I go by here,
or Mr. Jin, whatever you prefer, okay?

137
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,001
I'm busy, so hurry up.

138
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,840
Anyway, I don't have the watch on me.

139
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,843
-[Eun-su] If you left it at home--
-I actually gave it to someone.

140
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,053
I already sent it out.

141
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,347
Huh?

142
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,351
Don't worry about it.
I didn't sell it or anything.

143
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,312
I'll be sure to pay for it right away
if the guy likes it.

144
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,358
-And what if this person doesn't like it?
-No big deal. I'll return it.

145
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,859
Simple.

146
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,862
[sighs]

147
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,116
I'm aware that you were
invited by Chairman Ma.

148
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,076
You're also an acquaintance
of Chairman Wang.

149
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,453
In light of that,
we've decided to give you a day's time.

150
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,915
But we insist you make your purchase
today, before the store closes.

151
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,167
All right, sounds good.
I'll know later on.

152
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,754
I know it's a lot of work for you. Right?

153
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,841
If I end up buying it,
I'll put in a good word at the store.

154
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,343
[footsteps approaching]

155
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,596
My name is Jo Eun-su.

156
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,061
Right. I'll mention Jo Eun-su,
assistant manager.

157
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,147
[writing]

158
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,237
I really think we should put
what you just said in writing.

159
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,906
It's not like it would be
binding or anything.

160
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,826
If you're worried about it,
report me to the police. I don't care.

161
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,997
[So-baek writing]

162
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,084

[cart rattling]

164
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,652
[woman 2] See you tomorrow.
Have a good evening, everyone!

165
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,736
[man 2] Have a good one!

166
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,696
[man 3] There's construction out front.

167
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,788
Gee.

168
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,251
Do you know how many exits there are here?

169
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,007
[inhales] There's one there.

170
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,054
Figures.

171
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,807
First thing you check
when you're out collecting

172
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,642
is where all the exits are.

173
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,102
You've gotta learn that.

174
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,144
It's basic.

175
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,773
Well, I do know how to persist.

176
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,736
This day is far from over,
so please sign our agreement.

177
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,659
I've always found it way more effective
to carry a knife than a pen though.

178
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,497
Right.

179
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,416
But I don't have a knife.

180
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,142
[paper rustling]

181
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,104
[writing]

182
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,117
[dog barking in distance]

183
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,036
[sighs]

184
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,037
[salesman] Enjoy.

185
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,456
-[man] Thanks.
-[salesman] Welcome.

186
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,999
[phone buzzing]

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,798
[So-baek] Jingang Chinese Market,
second floor.

188
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,091
[disconnect tone]

189
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,402
[suspenseful music playing]

190
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,110
[clattering]

191
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,863
[clattering continues]

192
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,451
[clears throat]

193
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,357
[breathes deeply]

194
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,025
Take it. Go ahead.

195
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,902
[phone buzzing]

196
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,906
HUI-SU

197
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,408
SORRY, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

198
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,744
[mysterious music playing]

199
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,919
Thieving punk knew it was a bribe,
but he kept insisting it was a gift.

200
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,045
Go figure.

201
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,764
You afraid that one's a knockoff?

202
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,643
I doubt you would do such a thing,
but I'm not so sure about the punk.

203
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,742
It's the right watch.

204
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,202
The only issue is the strap
has a small mark.

205
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,580
Are you serious? I checked it thoroughly.

206
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,377
It's fine, you can just buff it out.

207
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,797
Our establishment would never sell
a watch with a buffed-out strap.

208
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,636
I'm sorry, but we're going to need you
to purchase this, Mr. Jin.

209
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,229
The day's not over yet.

210
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,524
We're open to you buying
just the strap though.

211
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,739
I think it may please you to know
that only 100 of these straps

212
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,075
crafted with high-end alligator leather
are made each year.

213
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,661
It's pricey, but it will look lovely
with the watch you've got on.

214
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,995
I can put it on now.

215
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,378
Thanks, but I don't need it.

216
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,923
I'm willing to pay you three million won.
You know it's a great offer.

217
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,510
Sorry, that won't work.

218
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,346
You've got a lot to learn
about winning people over.

219
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,430
[mah-jongg tiles clatter]

220
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,057
You should've come back at five million.

221
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,267
You should've thought
about not stealing it.

222
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,105
I mean, inadvertently take it.

223
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,736
You don't have to do this.
You won't get a raise, will you?

224
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,366
Actually, I have sights
on becoming an executive.

225
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,873
[mah-jongg tiles rattle]

226
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,562
I've never made a bad deal.

227
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,564
I'm not in the habit of losing.

228
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,409
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

229
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,878
Why'd you steal the watch anyway?

230
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,882
I already explained to you.
I just borrowed it for a while.

231
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,093
You know, I didn't realize it when
I looked at this place from the outside,

232
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,679
but this isn't just
an average retail shop.

233
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,807
You run this market a lot more
like a major trading company.

234
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,601
I wasn't sure the deal would go through.

235
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,395
You can't expect me to buy the watch
just to return it later.

236
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,230
Oh.

237
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,152
You just spouted out
such complete nonsense,

238
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,322
and you were so confident,
I almost bought it.

239
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,790
[Eun-su slurps]

240
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,296
Jo Eun-su.

241
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,181
I want you to tell me something.

242
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,687
Do you ever…

243
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,568
let your wild bitch come out?

244
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,294
[sighs]

245
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,551
[glass clatters]

246
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,972
I'm pretty sure you do everything
you can to keep it under control.

247
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,393
[glass clatters]

248
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,478
[pensive piano music playing]

[money counter whirring]

250
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,406
How would you like to come
work for me, Eun-su?

251
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,658
Oof. Uh, no.

252
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,915
Just hand over your watch
to let me change the strap, okay?

253
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
[mah-jongg tiles clattering]

254
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,172
Do you hear this clattering?

255
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,427
It's supposed to help you relax
when you're stressed out.

256
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,599
Well, I just got ripped off,
so I need a whole lot of clattering.

257
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,642
Clatter, clatter.

258
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,937
I hope this helps.

259
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,607
Clatter, clatter, clatter.

260
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,400
Clatter, clatter.

261
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,363
[exhales]

262
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,875
[Eun-su] I'm pretty clumsy.

263
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,420
[tiles clattering]

264
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,297
You got that right.

265
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,677
Hui-su could do this, no problem.

266
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,929
She's a friend of mine.

267
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,388
She's good with her hands.

268
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,641
She's talented at writing and draws.

269
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,267
She writes kids' books.

270
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,359
[tongue clicks]

271
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,528
Kids' books. Wow!

272
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,991
[Eun-su] Yeah, the kind of stories
that end with "happily ever after."

273
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,245
-Oh! The strap--
-Don't worry, next time.

274
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,330
[pensive piano music continues]

275
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,350
Hold on.
The least I can do is hold this for you.

276
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,435
[both chuckle]

277
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,396
We had no information on that guy.

278
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,440
None of us knew Jin So-Baek.
The team leader was so worried.

279
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,235
Hey, I knew you'd do it.

280
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,945
You did it on your own. [laughs]

281
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,572
You did it. You are the best.

282
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,991
Knock it off.

283
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,661
Hey, do me a favor?
Can you bring this to my seat?

284
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,162
Uh, okay.

285
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,001
Hi there!

286
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,796
Oh, hi. Nice to see you.

287
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,673
[Eu-sun] Likewise. How have you been?

288
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,383
Really well.

289
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,968
[both laugh]

290
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,972
Uh…

291
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,558
You think Hui-su will like this?

292
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,185
[Eun-su] Sure she will. It's gorgeous.

293
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,896
What's the occasion though?

294
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,149
It's not her birthday or your anniversary.

295
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,275
[chuckles]

296
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,235
Well, I love surprising her.

297
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,486
He spoils her.

298
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,322
He's one of our regular customers.

299
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,658
It's weird.
Hui-su doesn't come by here often.

300
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,202
I always shop alone.

301
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,121
She loves getting my surprises.

302
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,581
She does?

303
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,127
That's strange. She reads the end of
mystery novels before starting them.

304
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,253
[chuckles]

305
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,297
[saleswoman] It's all wrapped up, sir.

306
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,549
Wonderful, thanks so much. See you soon.

307
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,009
After you.

308
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,721
[light jazz playing]

309
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,099
Take care. Nice seeing you.

310
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,063
He's really mellowed out.

311
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,689

Yes, ma'am?

[gasps]

316
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,725
[gasps] Oh, Mrs. Kang.

317
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,143
Are you all right?

318
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,728
[sniffles]

319
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,272
Zip me up, will you?

320
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,650
Sure.

00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,280

[Eun-su exhales sharply]

[Eun-su gasps]

326
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,777
Eun-su, I thought…

327
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,824
you would be different.

328
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,539
It's all right.

329
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:24,504
You know, our VIP sales team
truly values our clients'… privacy--

330
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,630
[door slams open]

331
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,924
[gasps] Sir.

332
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,260
[Hui-yeon sniffles]

333
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,015
[man] Here you are.

334
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,104
You'd look much better…

335
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,941
with a jacket on.

336
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,946
Lovely.

337
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,824
You can wear it home.

338
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,243
Of course. Go right ahead, Mrs. Kang.

339
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,455
[man] How do you like the outfit, Ms. Jo?

340
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,504
It suits her well.

341
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,883
[man] You have a good eye for fashion.

342
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,179
[footsteps approaching]

343
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,185
Come to think of it,
there's a great pair of shoes

344
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,979
that'll perfectly complete this look
at the boutique next door.

345
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,231
May I escort her there?

346
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,317
[unsettling music continues]

347
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,455
You already know my wife's size.

348
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,670
Have them delivered.

349
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,881
Yes, I will.

350
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,898
We have tons of great shoes here.

351
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,650
Wouldn't those work?

352
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,319
Sure, why not? [sighs]

353
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,239

00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,885
Anyway, thanks a lot for yesterday.

715
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,722
I've gotta run. I'm sorry.

Uh, sorry.

719
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,752
[Eun-su] Oh.

Eun-su.

726
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,919
I'm going back home.

727
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,213
I applied for a transfer.

728
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,382
Yeah, why?

729
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,634
Gyeong-gu's younger brother
is a police officer.

730
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,637
Said he saw you and Dad at the station.

731

[sighs]

732
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,185
When we were kids,
we used to hide in the closet a lot.

733
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,938
It wasn't to play hide-and-seek, was it?

734
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,148
[loud thud]

735
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,860
Why would we both hide if it was just
the two of us playing? Doesn't make sense.

736
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,653
[loud thud]

737
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,530

00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,450
You were just a kid too back then.

740
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,830
Eun-su, sorry.

741
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,043
You didn't know.

742
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,295
You were small.

743
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,088
You did good.

744
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,674
You told on Dad.

745
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,343
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of Mom.

746
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,805
Get back to work. Make some money.

HUI-SU, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
HAVE YOU HAD LUNCH?

751
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,618
THE WEATHER'S LOVELY, LOOK OUTSIDE

752
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,458
Done, sir.

[So-baek exhales sharply]

754
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,765
So I've got your receipt
and the warranty card for the watch strap.

755
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,728
And this is what I owe you
for the bar tab.

756
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,854
Thanks again.

[inhales] You can treat me
to a meal, okay?

760
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,743
To thank me for giving back the watch.

761

[TV playing indistinctly]

763
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,430
It's crucial in life to let go of
the insignificant things to move forward.

[silverware clatters]

765
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,062
What if they aren't insignificant?

766
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,152
Then unleash that crazy bitch in you.

767
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,699
[chuckles]

768
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,952
[reporter] We have
an unfortunate incident to report.

769
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,997
There was a tragic accident
involving a woman who ended her life

770
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,541
by throwing herself in front of
the car her husband was driving.

771
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,169
The tragedy took place
in an upscale residential area in Seoul.

772
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,717
Kang, the woman, was struck and killed by
a large SUV driven by Kwon, her husband,

773
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,927
a successful corporate executive.

774
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,847
The husband's lawyer insists
it was just an accident.

775
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,433
However, information has been leaked
that the victim's body

776
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,768
shows evidence of repeated physical abuse.

777
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,937
[man] Ms. Jo? Have you heard the news?

778
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,856
Mrs. Kang has died!

779
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:18,773
Huh?

780
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,068
We have to pick out black mourning attire
for the bereaved family

781
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,653
and go to the funeral home.

Are you there? Ms. Jo?

785
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,329
[Hui-yeon] Eun-su, I thought

786
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,915
you would be different.

Hmm.

796
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,106
Okay, I'll call later.

I gotta face this.

808

You're not gonna say something dumb like,
"I could've saved her," are you?

[unsettling music playing]

816
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,925
Why should she have suffered and died?
She should have gotten revenge.
