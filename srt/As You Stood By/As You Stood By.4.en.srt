181
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,786
Uh, I think my son needs me.

182
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,704
Oh.

183
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,668
[uneasy music playing]

184
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,798
So you miss him too much.

185
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,342
[both chuckle]

186
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,847
And your boat?

187
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,058
Hope you found a safe route?

188
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,434
Where do you start?

189
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,186
Pyeongtaek?

190
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:15,980
Gunsan?

191
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,112
Incheon?

192
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,572
Yeah. [chuckles nervously]

193
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,949
Oh, they've been cracking down there.

194
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,201
You'll have to be careful.
Security is really tight.

195
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,663
[distant car horn blaring]

196
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,293
You are heading to Incheon Harbor,
not airport?

197
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,420
[laughing] The airport!

198
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,963
[both laughing]

199
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,551
Yeah, but flying home would be great, huh?

200
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,473
If you're leaving 'cause of trouble,
I can't really cover for you.

201
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,435
Uh, you won't have to. [chuckles]

202
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,436
Jo Eun-su.

203
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,481
She knows you're leaving?

204
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,948
Jo Eun-su? Who's that?

205
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,752
We had a couple meetings at the warehouse.
I thought you met her.

206
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,004
Head back in. I'll be in soon.

207
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,505
Okay.

-[phone buzzes]
-No way. He's no good.

219
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,609
All he does is sing the old songs
like the ones my grandma loved.

229
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,686
Don't you remember
washing these last night?

230
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,438
I thought it'd be better to do it again.

231

[inhales sharply, sneezes]

232
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,488
I keep sneezing.
Did you spray all your perfume?

233
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,908
I wanted to hide the smell.
I guess I overdid it.

234
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,119
We already used air freshener last night.

235
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,209
You're more sensitive than me, I guess.

236
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,007
Did you get it ready?

237
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,468
Mm-hmm.

238
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,890
[phone buzzes]

239
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,894
Yeah?

240
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,022
What, you're here?

242
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,279
I thought I'd show up early.

Good thinking.

245
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,009
Such a nice house.

246
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,887
And it smells really good. [chuckles]

247
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,180

251
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,076
So I asked you to come over
to try on this suit.

252
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,619
It looks good on you.

253
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,664
[Kang] Thank you. It's a very nice suit.

254
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,376
And the bag too. [chuckles]

255
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,255
I'll give you the passport at the airport.
Is this all you have?

256
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,635
Yeah. I don't have much to bring back,
except what you bought.

257
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,224
[Eun-su] You'll go down first.

258
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,310
The suitcase is heavy.

259
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,561
Oh, right.

[Kang grunts]

261
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
[Eun-su] I called a car for you.

[uneasy music playing]

263
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,657
Wait.

264
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,201
Here.

265
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,047
Oh!

266
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,055
Oh.

267
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,526
[Kang] Ooh!

269
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,696
Wow.

270
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,616
I don't know what to say.

271
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,034
Thank you so much.

272
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,957
So I'll see you in a bit.

273
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,083

Stop, I wanna get out.

282
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,947

Sounds like you were expecting someone?

299
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,295
Uh, just one of my neighbors
who left her colander here.

300
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,215
Guess you're pretty close
with your neighbors,

301
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,300
greeting them in your bare feet and all.

302
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,306
Those aren't my brother's shoes, are they?

303
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,518
Uh, he only wears them
when he does volunteer work.

304
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,354
[scoffs] I'm not surprised.

305
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,231
I just need to freshen up.

306
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,110

00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,151
Oh, I accidentally spilled
the air freshener.

313
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,986
Oh.

314
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,740
You wanna come sit in here?

00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,283

It's chipped right here.

00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,147
I better get you that water.

335
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,701
Hey, didn't you have pictures
from your wedding or something over there?

336
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,834
Have you been arguing?

You know they do
a family background check, right?

358
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,303
