00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,266
And as my dad got older,

167
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,060
I thought he'd calm down
and stop the abuse.

168
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,356
And when I realized
he was still hurting her, I ignored it.

169
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,486
I was afraid I'd lose the life
I'd built here and get sucked back in.

189
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,594
How did you know?

190
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,806
Is there anything
I don't know around here?

191
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,307
[bottle slams]

192
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,073
I know what you've been up to and that
you're in deeper than you can handle.

193
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,745
Hmm?

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,837
I'm surprised you got this far
without getting caught.

195
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,477
Those memories will always
come back to haunt you,

196
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,771
no matter how far you try to run.

197

[music fades]

206
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,110
That happened 20 years ago,

207
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,905
but sometimes I feel like
I'm still covered in blood.

208

[cup thuds]

209
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,669
You know, what you two did
is kind of admirable in a way.

210
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,551
I had a chance to see some things
on your husband's phone.

211
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,807
Son of a bitch got exactly
what he deserved.

I'll send Jang back to Shanghai.

-It's not your problem though.
-You don't stand a chance against the guy.

218
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,632
Okay? He was a stowaway who survived
the roughest slums in China.

219
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,926
He's cunning, and he even managed
to pull one over on me,

220
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,136
and I'm a tough one to fool.

221
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,722
It's only fitting
that I put him in his place.

222
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
He's not only cunning, he's vicious.

223
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,936
He won't go down without a fight,
and you don't back down.

224
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,605
I backed down the first time
you showed up here, didn't I?

225
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,858
[pensive music playing]

226
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,986
You're being overly protective,
and I appreciate it--

227
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,571
Then appreciate it.
Do as I say, and it'll be over.

228
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,241
-This is my fault and my problem to solve.
-Enough.

229
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,284
You're on my payroll.

230
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,830
And your friend could be on it soon.

231
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,959
So just accept the fact
that I'm gonna help you.

232
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,713
[pensive music continues]

233
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,465
Jang Kang was nowhere to be found.

234
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,926
And then there's the other car.

235
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,720
When she took the exit all of a sudden,

236
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,472
I thought maybe
she wasn't tailing us after all.

237
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,808
But then she came back.

238
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,477
She drove right past me on that road.

239
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,107
Try running the plate number.

240
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,361
And send someone to watch
where Jang's staying.

241
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:10,946
Huh?

242
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,364
Uh-huh.

243
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,078
We found your phone.

244
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,664
[sighs] That's a relief.

245
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,958
When you were driving last night,

246
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,627
did you happen to notice
anyone following you?

[Jin-young] Jang Kang.

260
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,895
Did you make copies of what you saw
on Jin-pyo's phone? Yes or no.

261
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,190
Ah…

262
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,401
Your brother's missing,
and that's your first question?

263
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,153
Did you make any or not?

I'd start talking if I were you.

267
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,252
I know you murdered that security guard.

268
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,173
No, I didn't. [laughs]

269

Are there any copies?

[unsettling music playing]

Ah, of course not.

I only finished the few drops
that were left from the last bottle.

295

Go ahead.

Turn the place upside down.
You won't find any.

I need to borrow your car for a while.

Mine's got a weird noise going on.

The garage at my place
is under renovation,

302
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,621
so I need to leave it here.

303
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,207
It smells awful
from the scenes I've been working.

304
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,418
So stay out of the garage for now.

Noh Jin-young.

314
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,350
You said your husband's name
is Jin-pyo, right?

315
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,018
And his sister is Jin-young?

316
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,853
How do you know Jin-young?

317
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,024
So the car
that was following me last night…

318
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,317
It was Noh Jin-young's.

319
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,447
And Mr. Ma says he saw this car
when Jang Kang got into yours.

320
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,409
Noh Jin-young knew he was there
when she followed you.

321
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,122
I don't see how Jin-young could have known
who Eun-su or Jang Kang were.

322
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,750
She hasn't come over lately,
and we haven't talked either.

323
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,043

Oh, really?

326
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,925
I think she would have called you first
if she'd known anything about Jang.

327
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,302
[Hui-su] But she didn't call me.

328
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,722
And I thought for sure Jang would call me
after what went down yesterday,

329
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,890
but he hasn't called either.

330
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,853
I… kinda panicked and called him
when I couldn't reach you last night.

331
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,232
He answered but hung up
without saying anything.

332
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,990
Given that neither one's gotten in touch,
I'd say she's got him.

333
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,539
I look forward to working with you.
So welcome aboard.

Please.

Your friends and family,

340
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,054
you better watch them like a hawk
if you wanna stay.

No matter how capable you are,

342
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,559

tarnishes your reputation,

00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,350
When did this blood get here?

366
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,860
[ominous music continues]

367
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,752
[paper rustling]

368
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,141
[phone camera clicks]

369
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,270
[stirring music continues]

370
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,637
Welcome to Lavie.

371
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,726
Oh, the most doting husband
with excellent taste.

372
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,438
Would you testify to that under oath?

373
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,023
Sorry?

374
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,073
Could I get the new catalogue
for the spring collection, please?

375
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,995
[Eun-su] Getting your wife
expensive jewelry doesn't necessarily mean

376
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,080
you love her.

377
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,919
It could just be a matter
of trying to buy forgiveness.

378
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,390
[phone buzzing]

379
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,188
Huh? Go ahead.

380
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,944
[ominous music continues]

381
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,114
[Eun-su] It looks like Jin-young knows
about Jang Kang and her brother.

382
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,426
[stirring music intensifies]

383
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,263
[gasps]

384
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,099
[yelps, grunts]

385
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,936
[breathing heavily]

386
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,194
[phone buzzing]

387
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,329
MOTHER

388
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,332
[waitress] Our specials today
are white ragù and truffle paccheri.

389
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,792
-Mm-hmm.
-[door opens]

390
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,172
My daughter-in-law will be happy.
Those are her two favorites.

391
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,840
We'll have one of each, please.

392
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,008
[waitress] Of course.

393
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,597
[sighs]

394
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,141
How are you?

395
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,145
Jin-pyo.

396
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,647
He's back, I guess.

397
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,316
What?

398
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,195
Jin-pyo… has returned.

399
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,032
[gasps]

400
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,285
[sighs]

401
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,789
Is he at work?

402
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,957
[unsettling music playing]

403
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,875
You knew?

404
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,544
Weren't you going to tell me
about my son's return?

405
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,217
You knew… what he was doing?

406
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,930
All these years I suffered,
and you never brought it up.

407
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,017
-And now you acknowledge it so casually?
-I don't have time for your nonsense.

408
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,896
If you're going to manipulate Jin-pyo
into begging me for money

409
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,981
dressed like a vagrant again,
set him free.

410
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,525
I'll care for my son.

411
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,781
[unsettling music continues]

412
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,212
[doorbell rings]

413
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,130
[music fades]

414
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,468
[unsettling, music resumes]

415
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,556
[So-baek] Noh Jin-young knew he was there
when she followed you.

416
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,770
Hi, how are you?

417
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,481
[chuckles]

418
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,067
We really need to talk.

419
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,197
Why didn't you call first?

420
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,199
You were caught on a dashcam.
You know that?

421
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,661
What?

422
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,708
I saw footage of you on someone's dashcam.

423
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,377
From the time
the security guard was murdered.

424
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,504
A resident drove past the scene.

425
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,218
I had forgotten something
in the car that day.

426
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,846
Maybe, but you're not the only one
in the footage.

427
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,640
It appears my brother

428
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,726
was down there too.

429
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,105
[scoffs]

430
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,567
He's still gone.

431
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,737
[chuckles]

432
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,113
So he wasn't there.

433
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,073
It'd be impossible.

434
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,621
But then again, Mom has started saying
impossible things too.

435
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,458
She'll tell me she saw Jin-pyo,
and then take it back.

436
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,920
"Never mind.
Just wishful thinking," she says.

437
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,339
So I thought

438
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,383
maybe I should ask you.

439
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,889
About what?

440
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,852
Hui-su.

441
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,940
Where the fuck is he?

442
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,863
Jin-pyo is… in Shanghai, last I heard.

443
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,533
[scoffs]

444
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,329
Yeah. That's right.

445
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,164
He took off on you.

446
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,709
But he'll be back eventually.

447
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,172
You know that, right?

448
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,675
[tense music playing]

449
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,093
Yes.

450
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,473
[music fades]

451
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,106
[car door opens]

452
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,116
When?

453
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,744
She's driving her mother's car now?

454
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,749
[sighs]

455
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,377
And we're sure
she didn't hand him over to the police?

456
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,046
Mm-hmm.

457
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,340
Go to Ko Jeong-suk's for now.

458
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,134
Yes.

459
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,678
Jin-young's mother.

460
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,972
-That's Ko Jeong-suk?
-Yeah, you know her?

461
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,600
Jin-young needs a clean family record.

462
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,520
She wants a position
on the Presidential detail,

463
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,564
so that would explain
why she's gone quiet.

464
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,317
Wow, another layer.

465
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,403
[mysterious music playing]

466
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,780
Until we know…

467
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,409
You think…
she could have hidden Jang in her car?

468
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,044
We'll wait for the call. Okay?

469
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,295
Let's just wait.

470
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,924
[music fades]

471
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,739

00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,008
[phone buzzing]

474
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,268
This is she.

475
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,314
Oh, the Lavie department store?

476
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,149
Yes.

477
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,526
They're beautiful.

478
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,528
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

479
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,614
First, I apologize for the short notice,

480
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,076
but it would be such an honor
to have you speak at our VVIP event.

481
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,454
I really appreciate your making the time
to see me, Mrs. Ko.

482
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,081
When my children were little,

483
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,334
there wasn't a single day
we didn't have fresh flowers in the house.

484
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,255
On the priority list,
flowers came before food.

485
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:37,385
I truly believe that both my children
grew up to be gentle and kindhearted

486
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,139
because they were always surrounded
by the peaceful beauty of flowers.

487
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,015
I see.

488
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,643
So, these VVIP customers…

489
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,937
-Is there a theme for the day?
-[phone buzzing]

490
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,275
I feel so rude,

491
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,527
but would you please
excuse me for a moment?

492
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,778
I really need to take this.

493
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,613
Of course.

494
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,909
Yes, I'm at a meeting
with our future guest speaker.

495
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,169
[suspenseful music playing]

496

-[muffled groan]

497
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,110
-Jang Kang.
-[thump]

498
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,238
This is Eun-su. I'll get you out of there.

499
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,535
[car alarm blaring]

500
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,842
[Eun-su] Come on.

501
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,636
Jang Kang!

502
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,929
Jang Kang!

503
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,849
[suspenseful music continues]

504
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,274
[Eun-su grunts]

505
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,450
[car alarm blaring]

506
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,711
Disable it before they send someone.

507
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,512
JO EUN-SU

508
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,681

[car horn honking]

512
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,657
[music fades]

513
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,371
[Jin-young] There's something I think
I should tell you.

514
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,835
Hui-su thought the security guard
was spying on her.

515
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,255
She wanted to file a complaint,
but I convinced her not to.

516
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,884
But apparently, she threatened him anyway
without proof.

517
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,682
What kind of bothers me
is that man's the one who got killed.

518
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,352
Caught my attention,
which is why I rushed over there that day.

519
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,520
Oh, right.

520
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,191
We questioned a couple at the scene.

521
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,193
They left the garage
around the time of the crime,

522
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,572
and luckily, your sister-in-law
was cleared by their statement.

523
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,573
[Jin-young] Hmm.

524
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,409
That is lucky.

525
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,080
Oh. I wanted to thank you.

526
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,542
For not mentioning her visit,
that day she came in.

527
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,753
Sorry?

528
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,090
Ah. You don't have to thank me for that.

529
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,633
[both chuckle]

530
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,636
She has serious issues.

531
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,014
She, uh,

532
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,184
hurts herself and pretends
that someone else did it.

533
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,312
She's going to try
to pin my brother for abuse,

534
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,856
but she saw me and ran off. [tuts]

535
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,780
You know what?
I've told you too much already.

536
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,656
I took up your whole break.

537
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,493
-I'll buy you a drink next time.
-Or coffee's fine too.

538
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,911
-Yeah.
-At your service.

539
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,916
[phone buzzing]

540
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,252
Yeah?

541
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,508
When was this?

542
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,596
[unsettling music playing]

543
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,183
Damn it.

544
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,727
[breathing heavily]

545
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,604
Shit. [pants]

546
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,485
[breathing heavily]

547
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,738
-Jin-young.
-Mom.

548
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,909
-You didn't call the police, did you?
-Of course not. I waited for you.

549
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,995
-But you should check what's missing.
-We need to check the cameras first.

550
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
No, it was a woman who came here.

551
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,584
She… pretended she works at
that fancy department store.

552
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,920
She said she wanted me to give a speech.

553
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,588
-But it was a trick.
-Department store?

554
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,298
Do you mean Lavie?

555
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,633
Yes.

556
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,520
What the hell is wrong with you?

557
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,982
I had to do something.
Who knows what she would've done--

558
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,945
I told you I would take care of it.

559
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,449
Where were you planning to go?

560
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,701
Were you just gonna keep driving
till you figured it out?

561
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,453
How long were you gonna drive?

562
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,623
I assume you have some kind of plan,
since you took him?

563
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,592
You trying to get hurt?
'Cause that's how you're acting!

564
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,399
[sniffles]

565
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,610

568
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,714
[music fades]

569
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,677
Jang Kang is going back
on the first boat I can find.

570
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,137
Okay.

571
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,223
Noh Jin-pyo as well.

572
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,517
Huh?

573
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,185
Mr. Jin?

574
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,186
Noh Jin-pyo died.

575
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,063
He left for Shanghai
a month and a half ago,

576
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,315
and things went terribly wrong.

577
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,276
[butane hissing]

578
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,030
If you're doing all of this
because of what you said

579
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,283
when we were talking over soup,
you really don't have to at all

580
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,662
'cause I was so completely stressed out,
I don't remember a thing you said.

581
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,081
If Jin-pyo's still in Korea, then what?

582
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,165
[lighter clicks]

583
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,503
If you have a better solution,
I'm listening.

584
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,885
[phone buzzing]

585
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:48,315
[Jin-young] Gangneung Chodang
Police report, 1999.

586
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,400
Ring a bell?

587
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,902
[uneasy music playing]

588
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,112
I got it here.

589
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,532
112 EMERGENCY CALL INCIDENT REPORT

590
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,580
You were eight at the time.

591
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,752
[scoffs]

592
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,379
Can't believe this.

593
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,800
All I did was turn the volume up
to watch the wrestling on television.

594
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,135
Is that a crime now?

595
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,598
I bumped my face
cleaning the bathroom earlier.

596
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,059
[officer 1] We'll need to talk to
anyone else who's in the house.

597
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,853
[officer 2] It's okay. You can come out.

598
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:27,938
Hi.

599
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,690
[breathing nervously]

600
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,986
Can you tell us if you heard anything
like fighting or yelling earlier?

601
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,699
I… I fell asleep. I didn't hear anything.

602
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:43,287
[sobs] I was in the closet
with my brother.

603
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,706
We were there playing hide and seek.

604
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,791
[crying]

605
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,920
[Jin-young] You turned a blind eye
to your own family.

606
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,257
So why are you all of a sudden
meddling in someone else's?

607
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:59,887
Is this some kind of attempt
at alleviating your conscience?

608
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,641
If you thought
you'd come out of this a hero,

609
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,476
you thought wrong.

610
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,561
The only thing this is gonna get you…

611
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,065
is charged with murder.

612
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,070
We'll find out soon enough, won't we?

613
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,656
-I don't need Jang Kang to put you two--
-[phone beeps]

614

[disconnect tone]

615
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,288
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

616
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,374
[automated voice]
Your call cannot be completed.

617
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,000
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

618
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,919
[phone line ringing]

619
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,925
Mr. Jin.

620
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,803
You're right.
Jin-pyo needs to die in China.

621
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,305

[muffled screaming continues]

624
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,984
Just shut up!

625
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,365
[muffled] Where's Jo Eun-su? Huh?

626
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,326
Get her in here! [grunts]

627
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,703
Go get her!

628
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,413
I said shut it.

629
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,416
You'll be on the first boat
out of here tonight.

630
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,875
You don't give orders here!

631
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,678
[suspenseful music playing]

632
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,570
[Jin-young] Jo Hui-su.

633
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,200
She had been secretly siphoning off
her husband's money,

634
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,744
and when he found out,

635
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,873
she faked injuries to make it look like
he was abusing her.

636
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,251
Then she used it to blackmail him.

637
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,006
But that wasn't enough
to satisfy her greed.

638
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:03,427
So she recruited her best friend,
Jo Eun-su, to kill him.

639
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,720
[typewriter clacks]

640
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,477
Then they pretended
a loving husband had just run off.

641
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,354
[typewriter clacking]

642
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,784
Then buried him.

643
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,036
[muffles screaming]

00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,831

645
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,500
You're driving me nuts.

[screaming continues]

647
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,260

-Bastard!
-[grunts]

When I get back,

656
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,169
first thing on my list is gonna be
to hunt down your entire family

657
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,005
and cut 'em into pieces.

658
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,424
After I tell them
it's because of you. Fuck!

659
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,510
[tense music continues]

660

So, uh…

664

good luck

665
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,795

Crazy bitch.

671
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,373
I can take you to where he's buried.

672
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,002
[Kang exhales]

673
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,504
Your sister-in-law
and her friend won't say shit.

674
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,466
So we dig up your brother.

675
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,094
And take 'em for all they've got.

676
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,394
How much do you want?

677
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,271
Three billion.

679
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,777

[Hae-ryong] You really need to do this?

Hi.

696
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,957
I'm heading over now.
Should I bring anything?

697
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,960
Oh, before I forget,
you need to find your passport.

Mm-hmm.

759

I'm here to get some more information

I… should've paid more attention
when you were at the station

767
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,127
and offered you more help.

768
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,338

Thank you, ma'am.

774
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,829
On the night in question,
you were picked up on someone's dashcam.

00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,165
Pretty near the scene of the murder.

776
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,462
You were seen in the garage,

777
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,506
and I would like to know
what you were doing there.

778
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,343
There was something I needed in the car.

779
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:34,015
It says your car wasn't in the garage,
but in the outdoor near your building.

780
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,975
Where you usually park.

781
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,814
Um, I meant to say I was getting something
from my husband's car.

782
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,524
He always parks it down there.

783
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,568
He worries it'll get scratched
if it's outside.

Ah.

And I'll be back
if I need more information.

And my mom doesn't…
Just leave my mom alone. I beg you.

Do you really think I believe
your best friend wasn't involved?

She went to my mother's house
and kidnapped Jang Kang from my car.

01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,831
Just like the old days.

908
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,207
[chuckles]

909
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,589
I just need to go to the bathroom.

910
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,883
Don't take too long,
or they're gonna get soggy.

911
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,349
Thank you, Eun-su.

912
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,021
Hurry up. I'm starving.

913
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,315
Mm.

914
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,713
[music fades]

915
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,800
[uneasy ethereal music playing]

916
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,734
EUN-SU

917
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,569
[somber music playing]

918
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,987
[phone buzzing]

919
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,118
[somber music continues]

920
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,985
MOM
I'M SORRY TO LEAVE YOU ALL ALONE

921
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,862
I COMMITTED AN UNFORGIVABLE SIN
I KILLED JIN-PYO

922
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:32,905
EUN-SU

923
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,158
[somber music continues]

924
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,886
[music fades]

925
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,972
[suspenseful music playing]

926
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,335
[music fades]
