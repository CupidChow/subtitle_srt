00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,898
You can take your time tonight.
I have stuff to do.

184
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,822
[drill whirring]

185
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,701
[Jin-pyo] Since we lost Na-ri,

186
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,704
I only have you to keep an eye on.

187
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,042
Star of the show.

188
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,586
-Stay tuned.
-[drill whirring]

189
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,807
You had your period last week?

190
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,518
Yes.

191
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,271
I get upset whenever I think
of your miscarriage.

192
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,023
It took you so long to recover.

193
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,153
I wish you had told me.

194
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,322
I didn't know either.

195
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,163
Ignorance is no excuse. You know that.

196
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,960
I barely touched your stomach that day,
which is why I get so upset

197
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,087
when I think about how that doctor

198
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,215
gave me such dirty looks.

199
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,763
You'll be more careful about that, right?

200
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,474
Yes.

201
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,727
I love you.

202
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,812
I know.

203
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,355
[Jin-pyo laughs]

204
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,233
Thanks for dinner.

205
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,033
[suspenseful music continues]

206
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,586
[phone line ringing]

207
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,091
Eun-su.

208
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,968
…trying to reach is not available.

209
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,012
Please leave a message after the beep.

210
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,098
SORRY, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW

211
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,939
[music fades]

212
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,487
[bag rustles]

213
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,992
[somber music playing]

214
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,580
[sighs]

215
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,223
NA-RI'S TIME TRAVEL

216
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,025
[sighs]

217
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,944
[phone chiming]

218
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,332
[Jin-pyo] And as you can see,
there's a slight rebound at this point.

219
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,794
However, when analyzed
with the MA and MACD indices,

220
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,713
the bear market suggests that…

221
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,965
I'm aware of the trends, Mr. Noh.

222
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,263
Ah, yes. Um, what I was getting at
is that it would suggest

223
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,224
we monitor the VIX index
while we put this new strategy in place.

224
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,351
Tell me about this strategy of yours.

225
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,604
My pleasure. I mapped it all out.

226
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,772
[phone buzzing]

227
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,982
Oh, I'm sorry.

228
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,151
I need to get that.

229
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,741
-Yes?
-[Hui-su] Did you take your vitamins?

230
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,243
I'm in a meeting. But, yes, I did.

231
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,412
I need to get back to work.

232
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,788
[chuckles] Yes.

233
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,125
I'm sorry about that.

234
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,253
My wife checking in
to see if I took my vitamins.

235
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,630
[laughs]

236
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,674
You must be very good to her.

237
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,261
I guess you love things
other than spreadsheets.

238
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,432
[Jin-pyo] When you read mystery novels…

239
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,270
do you start from the last page?

240
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,856
[coffee pouring]

241
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,483
I ran into Eun-su…

242
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,568
when she was at work.

243
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,030
Once again,

244
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,075
I don't like that you two are friends.

245
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,161
Your coffee's nearly done.

246
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,997
[uneasy music playing]

247
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,925
[coffee pouring]

248
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,640
[Hui-su sighs]

249
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,478
[chuckles]

250
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,604
It's gorgeous.

251
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,065
Let's put it on.

252
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,993
[music fades]

253
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,812
[somber music playing]

254
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,453
[sighs]

255
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,502
[phone buzzing]

256
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,758
Hi, Mom.

257
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,763
[footsteps approaching]

258
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,058
-[fingers snap]
-You're coming out with me tomorrow.

259
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,489
[ominous music playing]

260
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,726
[poignant piano music playing]

261
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,980
Makeup will do the rest.

262
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,776
[woman] Last night,
he slammed me against the wall

263
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,570
and began to choke me.

264
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,240
It felt like a nightmare.

265
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,243
I could hardly believe it was happening.

266
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,038
I was covered in bruises,

267
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,874
sore on every inch of my body
when I woke up.

268
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,460
I was a mess.

269
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,713
I knew he would feel guilty
for the damage he'd done.

270
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,258
And as usual,

271
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,260
he apologized

272
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,845
with a lovely bouquet of flowers.

273
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:02,185
At first, you genuinely believe
that that is what love is.

274
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,940
He takes care of you
and lavishes you with gifts and attention,

275
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,651
acting like the man you fell in love with.

276
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,737
Then comes the moment

277
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,533
when you realize
that you are being subjected to abuse.

278
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,578
When he beats you so badly,
you are convinced you will die.

279
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,579
[smack echoes]

280
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,753
You'll want to escape,

281
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:33,466
but you will be so cut off,
and your self-esteem so diminished that…

282
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,678
that you'll think
getting help is hopeless.

283
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,888
That you are truly on your own.

284
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,765
But that's not true.

285
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,936
There are more people willing to step in
than you could ever imagine.

286
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,064
[doctor] And now the other arm, please.

287
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,191
THREE MONTHS AGO

288
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,196
I'll look at your legs now.

289
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,951
[receptionist] Your medical report
and a CD of your X-rays.

290
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,549
[officer 1] Yeah.

291
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,386
Okay, will do. Hey, Choi Gyeong-gu.

292
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,263
-[Gyeong-gu] Yes, sir.
-You have a guest.

293
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,140
[woman] I didn't know
you were stationed here.

294
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,310
[Gyeong-gu] Jin-young!
What brings you to this side of town?

295
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,978
[Jin-young] My brother lives around here.

296
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,772
Guess that puts him
under your jurisdiction.

297
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,650
[Gyeong-gu] Yeah.
You want me to arrest him? [laughs]

298
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,820
[Jin-young] Hui-su?

299
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,908
Hey. Hi there.

300
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,580
What are you doing here?

301
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,250
[Gyeong-gu] You two know each other?

302
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,586
[Jin-young] Yeah, she's my brother's wife.

303
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,421
[Gyeong-gu] Ah! Nice to meet you.

304
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,466
Ms. Noh was my superior
at the police academy. [chuckles]

305
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,221
If I'd known you were her sister-in-law,
I would've taken care of you myself.

306
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,514
Right.

307
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,015
It's nothing urgent.

308
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,352
-[papers rustle]
-[Gyeong-gu grunts]

309
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,743
[Gyeong-gu] She…

310
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,622
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF BODILY HARM

311
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,790
[Jin-young] Hui-su!

312
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,542
[footsteps approaching]

313
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,459
Yes?

314
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,629
[sighs] Is she a friend of yours?

315
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,552
[sighs] You must be
really worried about her.

316
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,513
Getting the police involved
is a pretty big deal.

317
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,392
I'm sure you believe your friend,

318
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,145
but just make sure you know exactly
what you're getting into.

319
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,981
Some women actually use
medical certificates

320
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,734
to claim abuse
for stuff they do to themselves.

321
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,697
You don't wanna be charged
with making false accusations.

322
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,365
[Hui-su exhales]

323
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,913
If your friend is willing,
resolve it in private.

324
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,623
For everyone's sake.

325
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,377
Really?

326
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,509
90% of domestic violence cases
go unresolved.

327
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,597
That's just how things are.

328
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,686
Think about it.

329
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,687
Right.

330
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,404
[somber music playing]

331
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,700
[woman] When you come across women
who ask for help,

332
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,246
it's very important they hear the words
"it's not your fault."

333
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,252
And that those words are followed up
with a gentle hug.

334
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,592
You'll remind them
what it's like to feel a loving embrace

335
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,346
after years of indifference
and constant neglect.

336
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,014
[loud applause]

337
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,651
-[Jin-pyo] Moving, as usual, Mom.
-[mother laughs]

338
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,277
[glasses clink]

339
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,988
A 1,000th lecture has to be good.

340
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:28,326
Ko Jeong-suk, the number one ally
of Korean women everywhere.

341
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,452
[giggles]

342
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,412
Did you enjoy it?

343
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,124
Yes, I did.

344
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,752
[Jeong-suk] The topic
is a bit depressing, isn't it?

345
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,212
Domestic abuse.

346
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,381
So heavy yet such a crowd pleaser.

347
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,758
I think it just goes to show

348
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,345
that behind closed doors,
it happens a lot more than we suspect.

349
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,514
Why so much provocation?

350
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,225
It leads to anger and violence.

351
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,394
And the world needs more kindness.

352
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,313
Hui-su,

353
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,983
did you fall down again?

354
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,026
Uh… yeah.

355
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,571
[Jeong-suk] They need
to fix that staircase.

356
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,155
[Jeong-suk sighs]

357
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,076
Son, go complain to the property manager.

358
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,247
They need to make those stairs safer
so your wife doesn't keep slipping.

359
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,582
You need to be the one to do it.

360
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,126
You know as well as I do,
they don't listen to women.

361
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,794
Right. [chuckles]

362
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,838
We'll take care of it.

363
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,302
-[Jin-young] Hey, everyone.
-[Jeong-suk] You made it, sweetheart.

364
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,678
I'm so glad.

365
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,514
-[Jin-young] Congratulations, Mom.
-[Jeong-suk] Thank you.

366
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,224
[Jin-young] Sorry I missed your lecture.

367
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,018
You did miss a good one.

368
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,227
It was a huge hit.

369
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,854
You're a superstar.

370
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,772
We ordered ages ago.

371
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,276
Okay.

372
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,113
What's good here anyway?

373
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,408
Hui-su, how are you since?

374
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,663
Good.

375
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,966
[door opens]

376
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,760
[door closes]

377
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,891
Are you leaving already?

378
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,018
Yeah, I gotta get back to work.

379
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,191
Your friend, did she decide
to take the advice I gave you?

380
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,276
Or file charges?

381
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,405
Neither.

382
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,533
She decided to forget it.

383
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,118
She's gonna keep it private.

384
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,454
Good for her.

385
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,834
[chuckles] She's a smart girl.

386
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,295
That was a good decision.

387
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,843
[door opens]

388
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,387
[door closes]

389
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,473
[Jin-pyo] You think my sister has a shot
at the Presidential Office job?

390
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,935
I think so.
She is really good at what she does.

391
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,230
Good at riding on dad's coattails
is more like it.

392
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,066
Even though he's dead,
his connections still count.

393
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,030
Do you and Jin-young stay in touch?

394
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,659
Uh, no.

395
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,619
[uneasy music playing]

396
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,496
'Cause at the restaurant she said…

397
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,666
[Jin-young, Jin-pyo]
"Hui-su. How are you since?"

398
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,465
Mm, what about it?

399
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,926
I'm just saying.

400
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,223
I thought it was interesting
she didn't just ask you, "What's new?"

401
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,687
Like maybe there's something
the two of you are hiding.

402
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,771
She was being friendly.

403
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,815
What did you talk about
in the ladies' room, then?

404
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,403
-She wanted to know about the lecture.
-No, she didn't.

405
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,490
Anyone could look that shit up
on the Internet.

406
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,295
Why don't you pour us a drink?

407
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,048
I'll get you one.
I had two glasses at dinner.

408
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,009
I know, but you can let loose when
we're here at home. You know I like it.

409
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,093
That would be amazing,

410
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,804
only I forgot to go to the store
for beets earlier.

411
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,098
I don't have any
to make juice for tomorrow.

412
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,227
I should've asked you to stop at the store
on the way home, I guess.

413
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:27,982
Make it quick.

414
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,942
I will.

415
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,495
[tense music playing]

[gasps]

417
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,801
I can explain.

00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,180
[whimpers]

420
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,314
Damn, US stocks are down.

421
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,193
[reporter on radio] The Dow plunged
nearly 900 points overnight,

422
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:17,615
and the Nasdaq dropped 700 points
for 4% in a painful session for it.

423
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,493
Look at the futures. I wanna pull a doubt…

424
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,578
[poignant piano music playing]

[phone ringing]

430
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,232
Sorry, Eun-su.

00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,695

YOUR SHIPMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED

[Eun-su] Hui-su!

435
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,893
What the hell? It's me!

[phone ringing]

437
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,986
You're avoiding me, right?

438
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,073
What's going on?

439
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,033
I know something's wrong. Let me in.

440
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,869
[Hui-su] It's not a good time.
I'll call you later.

441
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,163
[Eun-su knocking on door]
Open the door for a second!

442
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,750
Not now. Just go, please.
I'll call you tomorrow.

443
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,590
[beeping]

444
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,056
What the hell?

445
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,599
I'm fine.

446
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,601
We'll have lunch this week. You should go.

447
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,937
Don't tell me your husband did this?

448
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,606
Eun-su. Don't!

449
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,109
There's a camera in the living room.
Come on.

450
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,571
I don't want him to see you here.

451
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,628
[Eun-su] What is this?

452
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,298
Why are your paints in here?

453
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,467
Oh, this is just stuff
I need to throw out.

454
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,053
I need you to go, please.

455
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,349
That necklace you're wearing…

456
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,729
[Jin-pyo] Uh, think Hui-su will like this?

457
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,983
Does he buy you jewelry
every time he hits you?

458
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,362
It's not like that.

459
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,240
-He was being romantic.
-When did this start?

460
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,325
And why didn't I know?

461
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,622
If he saw you… He'll be here soon.
You need to leave.

462
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,667
Uh, I'm not leaving you like this.
We need to get you to the hospital.

463
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,085
I tripped in the stairs.

464
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,546
Jin-pyo didn't do it.

465
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,674
-I'll help you file a police report.
-I said he didn't do it.

466
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,094
I fell.

467
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,641
How can you get cuts and bruises
all over from a fall?

468
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,436
And why is there a camera surveilling you?

469
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,147
I've had a hard time keeping up.

470
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,443
I can't do anything right,
so it's my fault we need a camera.

471
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,906
You think this is your fault?

472
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,036
I don't need you to start caring now.

473
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,289
[poignant piano music playing]

474
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,374
Hui-su.

475
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,336
-[Eun-su sighs]
-[phone chimes]

476
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,342
-[Eun-su sighs]
-He's on his way. You need to go.

477
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,970
I'm not leaving
until I can look him in the face.

478
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,847
-I said it wasn't him.
-You're lying.

479
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,891
I know what beatings look like.

480
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,104
I thought that my dad
had stopped doing all that shit.

481
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,814
I was a fool.

482
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,525
Once they start beating you,
they don't stop.

483
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,863
Hui-su,

484
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,865
it's not too late.

485
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,161
But if you don't do something,
that man will kill you.

486
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,292
Do you really think
I haven't tried to do anything?

487
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,591
I've tried confronting him.

488
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,010
Tried running away.

489
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,349
And I tried reporting him,
and I failed at all of it.

490
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,603
I always end up right back here.

491
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,443
We'll do it together.

492
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,534
Are you going to take the beating instead?

493
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,250
Each day.

494
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,963
All I want is not to get hit.

495
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,259
One night without taking a beating

496
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,094
is all I want.

497
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,640
Go now.

498
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,684
[music fades]

499
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:29,862
I wanna tell you--

500
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,573
I want some beet juice
since I didn't have any before work.

00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,946
[Eun-su] That day we were supposed
to meet for lunch,

504
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,783
you wanted to tell me,
but you just ended up leaving, didn't you?

505
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,328
I should've called
because I knew you were there.

506
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,288
I'm sorry.

507
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,958
[pensive music playing]

508
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,419
How could I… possibly tell you?

509
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,309
[Eun-su] Do you remember
our favorite color back in the day?

510
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,996
[pensive music continues]

511
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,624
You love these darker ones.

512
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,294
Not today, okay?

513
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,841
[young Eun-su] You like?

514
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,387
[young Eun-su chuckles]
Where are you putting it?

515
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,848
[young Hui-su] Hold it.

516
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,974
-Is it pretty?
-I think so.

517
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,934
Ooh!

00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,396
[young Eun-su] I love it.

-Selfie!

[both laugh]

523
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,662
[Eun-su] I always thought
we'd share everything

524
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,414
like when we were younger.

525
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,125
I never knew one of us
could hide something so big.

526
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,377
-[sobs]
-I'm sorry I didn't see it.

527
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,589
But I'm here for you now.

00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,385
I live one floor down.

536
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,386
In 1401.

537
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,888
Oh.

538
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,642
[Seon-yeong] I wanted to say…

539
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,313
I'm a night owl.

540
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,817
Maybe you can come hang out one evening.

541
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,166
[door lock clicks]

542
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,722
[uneasy music playing]

543

[phone ringing]

548
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,372
Hey.

549
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,296
[Jin-pyo] Put on more lipstick.
You look like you're sick.

550
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,517
Where are we going?

551
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,811
To a war zone.

552
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,606
The branch manager
who would've been fired ages ago

553
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,691
if it weren't for my numbers
pissed me off.

554
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,276
I've had enough of that idiot.

555
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,823
I intend to land a very important client
and shut him up for good.

556
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,449
Can't wait to see his face.

557
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,036
And my sister's.

558
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,083
[Hui-su] I didn't know
we were going to an art exhibit.

559
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,876
Aren't you glad?

560
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,170
You like art.

561
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,842
Act like it.

562
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,760
-Hmm?
-Mm.

563
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,647
[man] I've always been an admirer,
but this show…

564
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,858
You've reached a whole new level.

565
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,026
-Goodness, you're too kind.
-[Jin-pyo] Ms. Kim.

566
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,862
Good Evening. Gentlemen. Ma'am.

567
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,447
-Oh. What brings you here tonight?
-Congratulations.

568
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,993
Oh. You know I don't like
to do business at my events.

569
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,828
Oh, I'm not here about that.

570
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,746
My wife recommended this show.

571
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,418
Ah, you're the lucky one who gets
to remind him to take his vitamins.

572
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,211
She is. [laughs]

573
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,754
She's an accomplished artist herself,

574
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,965
so I… I get to go
to all the finest shows with her.

575
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,341
[Ms. Kim] Is that so?

576
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,136
I hope you'll assess my work
with a kind eye, then.

577
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,931
Everything looks so impressive,
and the colors as bright as you are.

578
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,392
Well, why don't you just
take a look around?

579
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,935
We will. Thank you.

580
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,605
[pills rattle]

581
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,630
There are lots of eyes on me.

582
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,590
Take it easy.

583
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,521
"There are lots of eyes on me."

584
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,564
"Take it easy."

585
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,900
[scoffs]

586
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,033
-[woman] We love your work.
-[Hui-su] You're so sweet. [laughs]

587
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,286
[woman] It's so creative and colorful.

588
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,664
-[child] Ms. Jo, a present for you.
-Oh!

589
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,750
-Such beautiful flowers.
-I love them. Thank you so much.

590
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,293

-One, two, three.
-[phone camera clicks]

592
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,719
One, two, three.

[phone camera clicks]

594
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:16,972
[Jin-pyo] Bologna?

Bologna?

[Hui-su grunts]

599
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,481
Bologna, huh?

600
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,984
-Hey.
-[whimpering]

601
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,486
Honey.

602
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,657
Not without me.

You would never…

[phone line ringing]

609
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,427
[Hui-su] I'm not feeling too well.

610
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:02,184
I think I'll have to pass on attending
the book fair in Bologna. I'm sorry.

611
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,062
Bye.

612
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,606

[sighs]

619
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:58,406
[Ms. Kim] I'm always nervous
when a fellow artist reviews my work.

620
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,285
Art is subjective.

621
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,957
I see some Picasso here.

622
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,292
I suppose you get kudos for that.

623
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,464
[slurs] You've titled it Serenade of Love.

624
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,719
I don't see any love here.

625
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,889
-Is it here?
-You've had too much to drink.

626

[Hui-su sighs]

627
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,018
When I was a little girl,

628
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:32,858
my father enrolled me in Gangneung's
highest-rated fine arts school,

629
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,361
with the idea that I'd turn into

630
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,115
a great artist like Shin Saimdang.

631
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,911
I think right now
he's rolling over in his grave.

632
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,831
[chuckles]

633
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,375
So they call this stuff art?

634
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,170
A kindergartener could do it.

635
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,796
Is that so?

636
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,797
[Jin-pyo] Honey.

637
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,803
Hold on. I haven't finished.
I still haven't heard her explanation.

638
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,306
Which part is the serenade?

639
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,807
I think we should go now.

640
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,773
You obviously don't know much about gesso

641
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,610
because everyone knows
you need at least three layers--

She's not well.

645
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,664
Please forgive her.

646
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,250
I'm very sorry, Ms. Kim.
She was out of line.

-I didn't mean it.

649
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,137
I'll go apologize for what I said. Okay?

650
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,140
I will. Let me tell her I'm sorry!

I don't wanna die by his hand.
