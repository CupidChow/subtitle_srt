the nonsmoking rules.

190
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
[Jin-pyo] I'm going!

191
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,084
If we keep receiving complaints
about specific units,

192
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,712
we will need to meet
with the residents to resolve the matter.

193
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,883
Once again, building management
reminds you that smoking is prohibited…

Screwdriver?

199
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,669
Yes. It's only about three inches.

200
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,881
I think I forgot to put it away
after I changed your strap.

[So-baek] Nope, I don't see it.

204
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,458
Uh, thanks, I guess I used it
to fix another watch after and forgot.

205
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,309
Is the new strap comfortable
and fitting right?

206
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,604
It's fine.

207
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,899
Oh, good.

208
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,905
What you said when I was here last,

209
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,658
I don't think it makes sense.

210
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,284
Which part?

211
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,789
She should've killed her husband.
Why did she die such an unfair death?

212
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,044
Yeah, so?

213
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,924
It's not worth killing him
if you end up in prison.

214
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,892
All the more reason not to get caught.

215
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,481
How do you kill someone
and not get caught?

216
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,817
Make sure no one knows you did it,

217
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,653
or make sure no one knows he's dead.

218

219
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,573

220

Why you asking?

224
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,348
Ah. You went to the funeral
and saw the husband there, didn't you?

225
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,558
[Hui-su] Please don't!

226
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,353

You're coming.

230
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,743
We'll go have the haejang-guk you owe me.

231
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,578
I have to get back to work.

232

-Not right now.

00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,911
Jang Kang.

239
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,498
Take that out first.

240
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,001
You're gonna need to do it in two trips.

241
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,590
I can make it all in one, sir.

242
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,344
[So-baek] I don't want you getting hurt
and stuck with a huge medical bill.

243
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,179
Do it in two, please.

244
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,889
Oh.

245
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,434
I didn't think of that. Thank you.

246
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,151
[So-baek] Did you need something?

247
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,821
I can go and have the soup
with you after all.

248
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,929
You didn't know
what I was gonna pull out, did ya?

[Eun-su] He's pretty nervous.

252
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,658
Is he illegal?

253
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,203
[tongue clicks]

254
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,537
Pretty much.

255
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,415
Where'd he come from?

256
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,500
Stowed away.

257
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,003
[intriguing music playing]

258
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,296
Without a passport?

259
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,716
[So-baek] Either he couldn't afford one,
or he had to run.

260
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,676
Probably no papers.

261
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,102
[So-baek] What can they do
if there's no body to prove it?

262
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,906
[intriguing music continues]

264
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,969
[Eun-su] You're sure Jin-pyo doesn't have
any relatives in China? At all?

265
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,304
Positive.

266
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,437
This could work.

[Eun-su] Excuse me, sir.

271
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,344
May I have a minute of your time?

00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,806
[music fades]

273
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,391
[man] That's a lot of money.

274
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,644
And all I'd do

275
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,814
is use a guy's passport

276
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,400
and fly to Shanghai?

[gentle piano music playing]

278
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,737
It is quite a lot of money,

279
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,781
and the only condition
is that you don't ask any questions.

280
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,786
Just do as I say,

281
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,372
and you won't have any trouble
getting back to China.

282
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,502
I suppose you had to learn to keep quiet,
considering how you made your way here.

283
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,387
You can say no and keep scraping by,
hiding every time you see a cop car,

284
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,224
or go back home to your family
with a nice wad of cash in your pocket.

285
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,310
Think it over, Mr. Jang.

286
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,482
You'll be heading home in first class,
not smuggled in the hold of a ship.

287
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,614
Call me in three days with your answer.

288
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,785
You need it that soon?

289
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,536
Yeah.

290
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,047
Just one question.

291
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,051
It would really help me make a decision.

292
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,937
Is this person…

293
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,733
Is he alive?

He's alive. What are you talking about?

299

[Eun-su] It's okay. He didn't notice.

302
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,389
He looks so much like him.

303
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,434
I know. Luckily, he doesn't have
that same poker face.

304
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,520
From what I saw, he won't even
take the three days to answer.

305
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,982
But he seems like a decent guy, at least.

306
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,821
If we do this thing right,
Jin-pyo will go missing in China.

307
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,867
All we're missing is a reason for him
to get on a plane and head over there.

How'd it go?

319
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,072
I'd say it went very well.

320
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,575
We should have her back here soon.

with you, Mrs. Kim.

He's smart and hardworking,
and an excellent strategist.

326
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,012
Normally, I would stand by him 100%,

327
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,223
but the disrespect
he showed you that evening,

328
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,850
and on such an important occasion for you.

329
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,686
Please accept my deepest apologies.

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,106
I do hope you can see beyond
Mr. Noh's transgression and forgive us.

331
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,027
I would be honored if you allowed me to
put together a team of talented advisers.

They'll treat you and your valuable assets
with the respect they deserve.

I'll see to it myself.

364
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,827
Hui-su.

365
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,286
Hi, Eun-su.

366
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,583
You haven't seen each other in a while,
so I thought I'd surprise you both.

367
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,001
I think it worked.

368
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,670
[Eun-su] Sure did.

369
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,922
[Jin-pyo] You're glad, aren't you?

370
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,216
-[Hui-su] Yes, thanks.
-[Jin-pyo laughs]

371
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,468
Over here.

372
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,430
[footsteps approaching]

373
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,234
Here's to seeing you away from work, hmm?

374
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,319
-[Hui-su chuckles]
-Right.

375
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,405
-And…
-[glasses clink]

376
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,323
…here's to the girl we love.

377
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,159
-[gasps]
-Oh no! I'm so sorry.

378
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,618
Oh.

379
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,204
Your jacket. It's all soaked.

380
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,373
I got you everywhere. [chuckles]

381
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,791
Excuse me?

382
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,628
I'm sorry. What a mess.

383
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,338
[Hui-su] It's fine. It's not that bad.

384
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,466
-You called, sir?
-Yes, I spilled a glass of wine.

385
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,301
I can help you with that, ma'am.

386
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,302
[Hui-su] It's fine.

387
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,721
You should go with her.
We'll wait for you to order.

388
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,099
[Hui-su] Okay, I'll try to make it quick.

389
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,903
What's new?

390
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,281
You know, I should check on Hui-su.

391
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,449
[Jin-pyo] The closet.

392
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,702
[unsettling music playing]

393
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,120
You were there that night.

394
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,006
I think what you heard
might have given you the wrong idea.

395
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,717
Hui-su

396
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,261
is pretty sick.

397
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,527
[exhales sharply]

398
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,820
She struggles.

399
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,698
Her mother's situation hit her hard.

400
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,284
[sighs]

401
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,538
[Jin-pyo] And after the miscarriage,
she gave up writing altogether.

402
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,874
Ever since, she's been anxious
and having dark thoughts.

403
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,379
I had to install a monitor
to make sure she's okay when I'm gone.

404
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,132
She thinks I wanted to spy on her.

405
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,471
[Jin-pyo] I'm worried.

406
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,851
I think she's having a breakdown.

407
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,896
The beatings can't be helping that.

408
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,900
[scoffs]

409
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,869
Some things need to stay
between husband and wife.

410
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,412
Violence is private, huh?

411
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,914
[tense music playing]

412
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,918
[wine swishing]

413
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,424
[lips smack]

414
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,010
If you had love in your life,
you would understand.

415
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,722
Hui-su would die if we weren't together.

416
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,725
And I'd be lost without her too.

417
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,020
That's what marriage is.

418
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,480
So having love means
having to get beaten, is that it?

419
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,444
I'd watch it if I were you.

420
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,368
'Cause when I get challenged,
your friend gets hurt.

421
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,835
You'll be taking it out on her
again tonight, won't you?

422
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,921
[laughing]

423
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,633
[footsteps approaching]

424
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,225
Did I tell you I found a way
to smooth things over with Mrs. Kim?

425
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,020
I don't have to go see her?

426
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,149
Turns out,
she and Eun-su have a connection.

427
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,409
[tense music continues]

428
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,918
[Jin-pyo] I'm always amazed
at what a small world this is.

429
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,503
Such a happy coincidence.

430
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,047
Hui-su has been quite troubled by this,

431
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,508
so I take it you will step in to help?

432
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,226
MS. KIM MI-GYEONG
CHEONGDAM-DONG

433
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,522
HOPES TO HOLD SOLO EXHIBITION
BEFORE TURNING 60

434
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,191
[Eun-su] I've always wanted
to see your first piece.

435
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,236
It's such an honor to see it here
in your studio, Mrs. Kim.

436
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,322
Compared to what you did for me back then,
this is nothing.

437
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,409
I don't know if I did much,
seeing as I had just started that job.

438
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,078
I only ran as fast as I could
to impress my boss.

439
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,665
You got there ahead of both the tow truck
and the police. You saved me.

440
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,334
My mother-in-law
betrayed me viciously that day.

441
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,335
If it weren't for you,

442
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,714
I would've been left freezing in
the middle of that terrible neighborhood.

443
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,465
Utterly depressed and wanting to die.

444
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,552
Would you like a cup of tea?

445
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,179
Mrs. Kim.

446
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,059
You said if I ever need a favor?

447
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,979
[knocking at door]

448
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,239
Pardon me, where's the restroom?

449
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,036
Thank you

450
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,455
for agreeing to see me again.

451
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,749
[Mi-gyeong] You should
save your gratitude for Ms. Jo.

452
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,419
I will accept your apology
and consider the matter closed,

453
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,296
so this conversation's over.

454
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,006
And please stop calling.

455
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,348
That's what you decided to do
with the one favor I owed you?

456
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,184
I expected something bigger.

457
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,774
It's always been a dream of yours,
hasn't it?

458
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,568
Putting on a solo exhibit
before you turn 60?

459
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,278
You remember that?

460
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,530
I wish my mom
could have a life like yours,

461
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,159
full of dreams and big ideas.

462
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:45,208
I thought how nice it must be when you can
spend your days pursuing your passion.

463
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,293
[tender music playing]

464
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,886
[light jazz playing]

465
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,572
[manager] I'll take over from here.

466
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,075
Sorry, Mrs. Kim.
I didn't know you were coming today.

467
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,126
Huh.

468
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,297
You will ensure that none of this
gets back to my husband.

469
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,759
And I… want nothing linked directly to me.

470
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,304
Yes. We'll use utmost discretion.

471
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,474
Our most important clients
do prefer a quieter approach.

472
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,060
Rest assured, we'll protect your privacy.

473
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,564
[unsettling music playing]

474
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,065
[phone buzzes]

475
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,992
[Jin-pyo] If you do not cross the line,
Hui-su will not get hurt.

476
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,912
Marital affairs are best
left between husband and wife.

-[music fades]
-[footsteps approaching]

478
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,052
I know it hasn't been a month already.

479
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,848
You're not open today,
so it doesn't count as gym time.

480
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
[man] Go. Come back in a month.

481
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,231
Or not at all, for all I care.

482
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,108
[Eun-su] I need this place.

483
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,322
You won't even know I'm there. I swear.

Hello?

497
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,711
[Kang] Hi.

498
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,423
The passport thing?

499
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,216
I'll do it.

500
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,805
You're willing to go back to China?

501
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,849
Yes.

502
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,060
I miss my son.

[cart clattering]

504
00:38:58,794 --> 00:38:59,837
Thank you.

[mysterious music playing]

507
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,360
I finished my run, sir.

508
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,195
Did I see you getting out of a car?

509
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,783
Yeah.

510
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,327
A friend from home is in town.

511
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,330
Hey!

512
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,208
A friend from back home, huh?

513
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,212
Must have been nice.

514
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,255
-Yeah.
-Good.

515
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,508
You can go.

516
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,675

[pensive music playing]

519
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,412
Using Mrs. Kim's account?

520
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,165
Since your husband requested the meeting,
it's the best way to avoid suspicion.

521
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,875
Oh.

522
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,546
I feel bad knowing
that she'll lose money on this.

523
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,842
We didn't have a choice.
Although, the firm will help her.

524
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,844
They'll be able to cover it,
and more importantly,

525
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,470
make sure it stays quiet.

526
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,347
She's a strong woman.

527
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,724
She's gotten over worse.

528
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,979
I see Jang. We'll talk later.

529
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,189

533
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,334
I was so surprised when I looked
in the mirror. I barely recognized myself.

534
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,711
I guess, uh,

535
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,754
I'll get used to it. [chuckles]

536
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,007
You do look really good.

537
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,633
-Oh, let me.
-Ah.

538
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,051
I can take that.

539
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,262
Wow, all this? [chuckles]

540
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,558
Uh, tilt your head a little. Bend down.

541
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,396
Oh. There was something in my hair, huh?

542
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,148
Uh… Oh, here too.

543
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,032
Pull over.

544
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,338
[man] Captain! We're gonna be late!

545
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,844
[sighs] It'll help if you use the siren.

546
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,929
Right.

547
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,972
[siren wailing]

00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,682
[mysterious music playing]

549
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,146
Is everything all right?

550
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,106
No, we're good.

551
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,236
[Jin-young] Jin-pyo,

552
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,072
the Presidential Office evaluation
is coming up soon.

553
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,031
CHOI WON-HO

554
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,369
[phone buzzing]

555
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,165
We should be there in five.

556
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,085
I'll let you know what's happening
when we get there.

557
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,253
[mouse clicks]

558
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,630

561
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,304
[exhales sharply]

562
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,307

563
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,351

566
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,693
[inhales]

567
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,533
Looks like I'll get promoted
before my sister even gets evaluated.

568
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,659
[laughs]

569
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,661
Have you gotten

570
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,871
even more beautiful?

571
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,207
[chuckles nervously]

572
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,002
Is there something going on
that's making you glow like this?

573
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,298
I would tell you, of course.

574
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,675
Good, because I don't like secrets.

575
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,011
[Hui-su laughs]

576
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,846
Such a good girl.

577
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,141
Turns me on.

578
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,606
[intriguing music playing]

579
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,197
Which one do you want
for your company dinner?

580
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,369
[Hui-su] He tends to drink more than usual
at his monthly branch dinners.

581
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,456
And even more when he gets home.

582
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,001
Then he passes out for the night.

583
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,921
You fly out on Friday.
We booked all your tickets.

584
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,301
I thought I'd have longer.

585
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,678
Sorry if this is catching you
on short notice,

586
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,221
but I figured you could move fast.

587
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,185
You figured that right.

588
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,063
I don't have much.

589
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,815
I'll give you the flight details
when we have everything worked out.

590
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,025
"We"?

591
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,404
You know, me and the other guy.

592
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,573
Oh.

593
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,116
Right.

594
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,082
Your first half of the payment.

595
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,254
Your son must have really missed his dad.

596
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,506
There's a bit extra in there

597
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,008
for you to take care of
your wife and son's travel expenses

598
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,468
to meet you at the airport.

599

604
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,371
Here.

605
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,622
[man] Oh, thanks, Kang.

606
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,416

609
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,720
[woman] Have you noticed
his new haircut and fancy clothes?

610
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,138
I think he has a girlfriend.

611
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,515
He says he's heading back to China.

612
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,183
[slurps]

613
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:29,893
Who?

614
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,687
[man] Jang Kang, sir.

615
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,189
I guess he saved enough to get home.

616
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,739
[Eun-su] Get yourself ready
as quietly as possible,

617
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,031
and watch out for Mr. Jin.

618
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,616
Not much gets by that guy.

619
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,326
Be careful not to let on.

620
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,747
Yeah.

621
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,064

[footsteps approaching]

625
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,747
The gym's closed for the day,

626
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,249
and you only suspended me
from attending classes.

627
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,626
Isn't that right, sir?

628
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,727
You've never gotten past white belt
all these years.

629
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,229
Do you ever wonder why that is?

630
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,817
From the moment you entered the gym,

631
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,528
it was obvious that your reason
for being here…

632
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,696
[sighs]

633
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,406
…stemmed from desperation.

634
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,204
I gave you the worst-smelling partners,
and you didn't back off.

635
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,249
I denied you opportunities to advance,
and you refused to quit.

636
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,043
I just wanted to try to improve.

Can I go with Eun-su

00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,776
What for?

672
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,653
She wants to bring her flowers
and say hello.

673
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:16,865
You can go.

674
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,952
And I'll be here when you get home.

675
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,288
I know that. [chuckles]

Yes, thanks. Did we have an appointment?
I don't seem to have you on my schedule.
