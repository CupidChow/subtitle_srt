You're evil.

193
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,897
I'm not the one who has committed murder.

194
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,316
You knew what he was doing to her.

195
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,609
If you'd tried to help her,

196
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,820
justice could've been served,
and he'd be alive.

197
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,365
[scoffs] You're a psychopath.

198
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,702
You killed him, and you wanna blame me?

199
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,079
All right! Go tell the cops!

200
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,665
You've got no proof of anything,
you idiot.

201
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,711
-You know what he did.
-What about what you bitches did?

203
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,965
Hui-su should've died last night.

204
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,093
Then maybe I'd have let you live.

205
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,929
Did you tell her

206
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,641
to kill herself in order to keep me alive?

207
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,395
Unbelievable.

You should've died together
in a suicide pact.

Listen closely, you monster.

212
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,910
If you mess with Hui-su again,
I'll destroy your precious little career.

If I backed off, you bitch,

217
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,591
I'd have never come this far.

[Eun-su] I know you can't eat yet,

I know he was
just a low-level civil servant,

one of those plaques

Is it true that you assisted
your older brother in fleeing the country?

He's a white-collar criminal

365
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,616
Jin-pyo! Jin-pyo!

366
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,328
What are you doing on the floor?
Come on. Get up, Jin-pyo!

367
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,372
Wake up! Jin-pyo! Oh!

368
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,833
What's going on with you? Goodness!

369
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,959
-[sobs]
-Mom.

370
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,962
Could you untie me?

371
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,548
[groans, grunts]

372
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,175
[groans]

373
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,888
Who are you?

374
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,973
I'm Jin-pyo.

375
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,391
Your son.

376
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:19,976
Mom?

377
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,187
Mom, I'm in pain.

378
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,688
Please untie me.

379
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,524
Th… That watch.

380
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,150
It's Jin-pyo's.

381
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,278
Give it back!
Why the hell are you wearing it?

382
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,906
For fuck's sake.
Who cares about the watch?

383
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,741
-Shit!
-Ah!

384
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,452
Like mother, like daughter.

385
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,579
Wow, you two are really alike.

386
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,959
You probably don't care Jin-pyo's dead.

387
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,255
What?

388
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,382
He's…

389
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,717
What did you just say?

390
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,265
Your son is dead. Gone forever.

391
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,016
Oh.

392
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,977
It's been a while now.

393
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,812
[panting] You're lying!

394
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,731
You should ask your damn daughter
if I'm lying to you.

395
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,569
She knows.
But first, get me the fuck out now!

396
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,864
Tell me what you did to my son.
What did you do?

397
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,825
[unsettling music continues]

398
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,620
You really should've raised
your kids better.

399
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,711
[echoing] You failed.
Your son's a loser. A worthless disgrace.

400
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,963
-[gasps]
-Fucking hell.

401
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,550
He's the reason my life's
all fucked up right now.

402
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,468
Your precious son's an asshole.

403
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,762
Jin-pyo was just a waste of flesh.

404
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,431

-[grunts]
-[Jeong-suk] This is crazy.

410
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,798
That bastard murdered my baby boy,
didn't he? Didn't he?

411
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,009
-Jin-pyo was killed! What happened?
-Hey!

412
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,970
Do you want us both
to end up like Jin-pyo?

413
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,058
I… could lose everything because of this.

414
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,727
We'll be charged with murder!
You want that?

415
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,687
You need to get a grip, Mom!

416
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,316
Pull yourself together,
or we're both going down.

418
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,194

[grunting]

420
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,867
Wait, stop.

421
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,786
Okay, now come. This way.

422
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,245
Lift.

Yeah, what's up?

429
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,272
[Hae-ryong] Jin-young loaded something
into her trunk and left.

430
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,108
I'm pretty sure it's Jang Kang.

431
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,859
I think he's dead, sir.

432
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,860
What?

433
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,073
She's with her mom.

434
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,409
They could be going somewhere
to dump the body.

435
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,207
All right.

436
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,918
On my way now. Just keep a close watch.

437
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,545
Hang on for a sec.

438
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,546
I should go.

439
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,631
That's not an option. Hui-su and--

440
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,133
Please, I have to do it.

441
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,344
No way.

442
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,515
I started this,
so I should be the one to finish it.

443
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,725
Eun-su, it'll be over soon.

444
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,686
It's almost over. I just need you
to take Hui-su and leave the country.

445
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,438
-Could you please do that?
-Mr. Jin.

00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,814

Are you sure Jang Kang's dead?

451
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,184
Okay, I gotta get going.

452
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,273
[Eun-su] Please take care of Hui-su.

453
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,442
Eun-su?

454
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,620
I want you to have this just in case.

455
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,211

I want you to keep your eyes on her.

[So-baek sighs]

463
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,683
You have any idea where she went?

Hmm?

00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,869
[Hui-su] On the night of October 30th,

512
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,497
I killed Noh Jin-pyo.

513
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,833
He was my husband.

Hey.

520
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,624
[reporter] Around 7:00 p.m. tonight,

521
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,335
a shocking discovery was made
in a three-car collision

522
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,586
near the outskirts of Seoul.

523
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:53,424
The body of a man was found inside
the trunk of one of the impacted vehicles.

524
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,260
The police have taken three drivers
and one passenger

525
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,513
involved in the crash into custody.

526
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,807
The driver of the vehicle
carrying the body

527
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,143
has been identified
as an active-duty officer, Captain Noh.

528
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,895
Noh's mother, a well-respected lecturer…

529
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,898
[detective] Everything was caught
on the dashcam.

530
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,566
There's no way she can deny it.

531
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,026
Why would she do that?

532
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,194
Get to work.

533
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,071

534
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,864

536
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,910
[Gyeong-gu] If you're feeling overwhelmed,

537
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,412
we can stop for today
and talk some more tomorrow.

538
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,082
No, we don't need to stop.

539
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,462
You and Hui-su are so alike.

540
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,510

00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,304

00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,894
I'll tell you everything.

[reporter] Another murder
and attempted murder

559
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,860
came to light
during further investigation.

560
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,656
The police now suspect the incident
was not merely a traffic accident,

561
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,659
but may be connected
to a far more serious crime.

562
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,329
New video footage has surfaced
showing Noh, while on active duty,

563

attempting to murder
her sister-in-law, Jo Hui-su,

564
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,668
and staging her death as a suicide.

565
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,004
Noh remained silent
while being transported to police lockup.

566
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,590
Her alleged involvement
in such criminal activities

567
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,218
has brought significant disgrace
to the police force.

Your twisted love for your child

I'm calling from Lavie Department Store.

[judge] Please make your final statement.

601
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,631
[Hui-su] During my marriage,
my husband's behavior made me…

602
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,302
want to end my own life.

603
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,516
I'd speak to the heavens, to no avail.

604
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,687
The beatings were constant.

605
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,565
I was wasting away in unbearable pain.

606
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,735
I came to realize…

607
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,365
it was never going to stop…

608
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,576
[somber music playing]

609
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,453
…if I didn't take action.

610
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,424
In the end, I…

611
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,927
I decided to kill my husband.

612
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,643
I'm well aware
that I'm to blame for his death.

613
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:24,648
I understand that there is no excuse
for committing murder.

614
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,777
And so I believe…

615
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,240
I should be punished for my crime.

616
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,536
[judge] Defendant Jo Eun-su.

617
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,371
Your final statement, please.

618
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,757
When I was small,
I would hear my mother getting beaten.

619
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,302
I would take my little brother
by the hand,

620
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,846
and we would go hide in the closet.

621
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,099
Then once it grew quiet,

622
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,561
I'd come out, eat, and watch TV.

623
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,565
I would act like everything was fine
and nothing had even happened.

624
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,654
At the time,
I thought it was because I was afraid.

625
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,907
I understood much later

626
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,160
that I'd become indifferent.

627
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,620
I'd learned to look away.

628
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,461
Even as a child, I knew deep down
that domestic violence was a crime.

629
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,755
But

630
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:35,052
much later,
I realized I was… also to blame.

631
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,139
By pretending I saw nothing,
I was also committing a crime.

632
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,396
I came to that conclusion
many years later, as an adult.

633
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,860
I now understand that it is not only
the abuser who is guilty.

634
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,574
Because if you turn a blind eye,
you are complicit.

635
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,493
Not helping someone
who's being abused is criminal.

636
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,998
I know my actions have shocked many.

637
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,627
But I know

638
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,047
I did everything in my power
to save my friend.

00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,344
I'm finally free now.

646
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,347
I left the house with Eun-hyeok.

647
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,644
It's not what you think. Don't worry.

648
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,856
I simply collected my things
and walked out of there.

649
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,653
That was all it took.

650
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,115
But for all those years,
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

651
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,788
I am so sorry

652
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,541
for putting you
in that foster home for a while,

653
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,793
when you were little.

654
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,506
I know you remember everything.

655
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,511
Your brother was just a baby, you know?

656
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,097
I figured you'd be safer there

657
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,558
while I got our affairs ready so I could
leave the house with Eun-hyeok.

658
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,105
But then, he fell really ill,
quite suddenly.

659
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,526
Running away
would have put his life at risk.

660
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,615
But the moment I heard you say
you wanted to come home,

661
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,617
I took you out of that place.

662
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,245
But I can only imagine…

663
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:09,039
[emotional piano music playing]

664
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:15,003
…how scared you were
being left there for ten days.

665
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,177
[sniffles]

666
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,684
I was just a kid, and I believed
I needed to stay close to my dad.

667
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,645
I wanted us to all be together.

668
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,732
[sniffles] I wasn't concerned about you.

669
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,862
[sniffles] I didn't know any better,

670
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,031
and my selfishness
caused you to stay with Dad.

671
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,034
You ended up spending your whole life
getting beatings from Dad,

672
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,661
not to break up the family.

673
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,872
I knew everything.

674
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,793
And I was afraid
I would end up just like you.

675
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,422
I was a coward.

676
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,216
I didn't have the courage
to face the truth.

677
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,760
[sniffles]

678
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,014
I masked all my fear
with a stupid superiority complex,

679
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,849
thinking I was better than you.

00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,812

JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

722
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,968
[car horn honking]

723
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,345
Hui-su, can you check this?

724
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,357
-[man] They only use quality ingredients.
-[Eun-su] They do.

725
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,401
-You should order more next time.
-Okay.

726
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,778
-[man 2] Bye, you two. Thanks.
-Okay. Take care.

727
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:32,821
[Hui-su] Thank you.

728
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,905
Sorry.

729
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,619
Hi. How are you?

730
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,997
-[woman] Good, but what took you so long?
-[Eun-su] Here.

731
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,914
Sorry.

732
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,500
[woman] People kept asking me
for this, but I had nothing to sell.

733
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,793
It's here now.

734
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,920
Right, but did you
fulfill the whole order?

735
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:49,838
[Eun-su] Yeah.

736
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,468
So does this look right?

737
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,969
Yeah. This is perfect.

738
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,304
Hey, babe!

739
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,848
Get over here and check this inventory.

740
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,850
[man 3] Hold your horses. I'm coming.

741
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,686
[woman] It's so hot outside.
You want something to drink?

742
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,937
It'll be my treat.

743
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,818
[lively dreamy music continues]

744
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,528
[Eun-su] Here.

745
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,574
All right. Let's get ready
to make a wish, okay?

746
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,952
It's floating.

747
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,079
Oh!

00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,173
[phone camera clicks]

749
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,931
Uh… [laughs]

750
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,892
Did you make a wish?

751
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,314
[both chuckle]

752
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,109
Look! There it is. See?
It's floating away.

753
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,360
It's beautiful.

754
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,365
[lively dreamy music continues]

755
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:07,958
THERE IS ALWAYS LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

756
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,675
[Hui-su] I used to
pay very little attention to the weather.

757
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,386
But now,

758
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,932
it's the first thing I wonder about
when I wake up in the morning.

759
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,102
What kind of sky will greet me today?

760
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,729
[gentle music playing]

761
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,523
[knocks on counter]

762
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,400
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

763
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,526
[laughs]

764
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,652
See you later.

765
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,904
-[man] Have a great day!
-Mm-hmm!

766
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,623
[gentle music continues]

767
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:54,004
[Eun-su] Even if good luck doesn't
wash over my life like crashing waves,

768
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:58,842
and even if rising tides
try to knock me down and swallow me whole…

769
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,264
I've learned not to back down

770
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,850
and to face each challenge with courage.

771
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,813
Because whatever wave
rolls my way tomorrow…

772
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,486
