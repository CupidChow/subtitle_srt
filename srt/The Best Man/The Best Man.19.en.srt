3
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,700
Meiying.

4
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,960
Mr. Yue,

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
I've brought the person you asked for.

6
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
Luckily, I found where Chen Zhuo stay
when he first arrived in Jiangnan City.

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
Please don't come near me!

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,480
Here.

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
Take this medicine.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,119
Be good.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,560
This won't kill you.

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,640
Take it.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Swallow it!

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
(The one who loves you is Chen Zhuo.)

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,919
(His twin brother, Chen Yue)

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,199
(has never appeared by your side.)

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,080
(This Chen Yue)

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,719
(is the murderer who killed his mother)

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
(and even tried
to kill you to silence you.)

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,120
(He's nothing but a ruthless devil.)

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,799
Meiying, let's talk at home.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,040
Don't come near me!

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,320
I remember everything now.

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
You...

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,199
You're the murderer
who killed your mother!

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,960
Meiying, do you even
know what you're saying?

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,600
Brother,

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,640
stop messing around.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,120
I advise you to turn yourself in.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,800
The police are already here.

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,680
Slow down!

32
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,080
Where did he go?

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,039
- You two, head that way!
- Alright!

34
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,999
You two, follow me!

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Alright!

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,759
Zhuo.

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,079
What happens to you?

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,880
Are you being hunted to be killed?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,280
It might be worse than that.

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,880
Yuhuan.

41
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
You've been there
making statements all day.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,120
You must be worn out.

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm fine.

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,919
I just hope

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,080
they can quickly bring
that murderer, Chen Yue, to justice.

46
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,160
Meiying,

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,799
stop worrying about this.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,519
Now that the police are involved,

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,599
I believe that they will

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,440
sort it out soon enough.

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,599
What concerns me the most is you.

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,120
Your brother dares to do anything else.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,879
He used Dao to force you
to show up today

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,999
and even sent his men to catch me.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,280
Fortunately, I called the police.

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,319
Otherwise, I can't bear to imagine
what could have happened.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,519
Oh,

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,799
it looks like I finally had

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,559
my 'beauty saves the hero' moment.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
Be serious!

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,479
You're not allowed to go anywhere
for the next few days.

62
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,039
You're only allowed to stay at home.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
Got it?

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,320
Fine, fine.

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll listen to you.

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,999
What?

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,559
You mean Meiying is now
with a fake Chen Zhuo,

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,719
and he's a murderer?

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,679
I suspect they used some drugs

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,160
to tamper her memory,

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,919
making her forget
about the recent stand-in

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,080
and mistake me for Chen Yue.

73
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,119
Doesn't that mean Meiying
is now in great danger?

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,439
Should we attend to help her?

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,039
No, I'm afraid alerting them
will only make things worse.

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,640
She's been in even greater danger.

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,120
So, what should we do now?

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,879
Yuhuan.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes?

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,599
Can you cooperate with me?

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,720
Of course.

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,800
(When did the floor mat get packed up?)

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,360
(Why don't I remember it?)

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
(Tonight,)

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,080
(you will become mine.)

86
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,280
Honey,

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,479
are you going to let me
sleep on the floor?

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,680
Are you?

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll go open the door.

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,719
Yuhuan.

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,959
Meiying.

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,480
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm going through a breakup.

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,000
A breakup?

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,479
Who did you date this time?

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,239
I dated an online influencer.

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,599
But, he turned out to be a playboy.

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,839
He not only scammed me for money,
but also played with my feelings.

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,719
Can you comfort me
and let me stay here for a few days?

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
No way!

100
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,519
Zhuo,

101
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,640
you weren't like this before.

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,439
He treated me nicely before.

103
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,519
No worries, Huan.

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,559
He's just joking around with you.

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,119
You have the house key, right?

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,199
You can come stay anytime you want.

107
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,680
Meiying always treats me nicely.

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,799
Can I sleep with you tonight?

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,799
Is that okay, Zhuo?

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,839
Please consider that I'm so pitiful,

111
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,359
and let Meiying stay
with me for a few days.

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,799
Of course, you can.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,519
Meiying was right.

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,240
I was just joking with you.

115
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
Thank you, Zhuo.

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,359
Alright,

117
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
then I'll leave here for you.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,399
(If you encounter danger,)

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,999
(SOS)
(press the button on it.)

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,920
(I'll come to protect you immediately.)

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,480
What's wrong with you?

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,839
I'm scared.

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,440
I keep feeling
that Chen Yue is by our side,

124
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,800
and ready to harm us at any time.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,159
That'll be fine.

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
Nothing will happen.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
I'll always be by your side
to protect you.

128
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,720
Don't be afraid.

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,159
You two, showing off your love in front

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,199
of someone who just had a breakup,

131
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,480
is that polite?

132
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
Let's eat breakfast.

133
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,360
(I need you to destroy Chen Yue's phone)

134
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,600
(to cut off his connection
with the outside world.)

135
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,439
(So, it could be easier for me)

136
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
(to collect evidence of his crimes
from his subordinates.)

137
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,079
Yuhuan, have some milk.

138
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,720
I don't like milk.

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,039
Sorry, Zhuo.

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,760
I didn't mean to.

141
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,639
Oh no.

142
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,800
The phone is unusable now
after getting soaked in water.

143
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,159
Sorry, Zhuo.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,799
I didn't expect this to happen.

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
No need to apologize.

146
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,519
Hey, Meiying.

147
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,079
Don't you think

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Zhuo's temper has changed a lot?

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,080
It's like he's a
completely different person.

150
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,840
Didn't you used to like him a lot?

151
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,760
(To Chen Zhuo: Done)
You changed your mind now?

152
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,520
I didn't.

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,359
Hey, Meiying,

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,679
how about you stay home with Zhuo

155
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,119
while I go buy him a new phone

156
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,199
to make up for this?

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,959
Sure.

158
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,439
We'll wait for you at home.

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,640
Oh,

160
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,959
by the way,

161
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,759
I've noticed you've been uneasy lately.

162
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,440
I have this advanced
emergency alert bracelet.

163
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,159
If you encounter any danger,

164
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,079
press the button on it, and someone
will come to save you immediately.

165
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,959
Alright.

166
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,720
I get to go now.

167
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
Okay.

168
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,279

169
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,440
