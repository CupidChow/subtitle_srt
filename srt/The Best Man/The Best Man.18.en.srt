3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,680
There's a blood stain over there.

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,920
I remember before Chen Yue attacked me,

5
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,560
that spot was covered in blood.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,680
Maybe this is the part
of the crime he's trying to hide.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,440
Find!

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,760
Find them now!

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,160
I must know their whereabouts.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,760
Got it?

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,360
Yes.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,440
Chen Zhuo,

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,840
if I can't have it,

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,880
you won't have it either.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
Do you think Xu Meiying is stupid,
or Chen Zhuo is stupid?

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
By now,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
they should have recognized
each other already.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,960
Did you know about this all along?

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,160
Why didn't you tell me?

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,400
Even I could differentiate you.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,040
Do you think

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
it's that hard

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,600
for a couple in love?

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
What if they can't tell the difference?

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,080
Even if the whole world
only had me left,

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,840
I could be both Chen Yue

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,320
and Chen Zhuo.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,040
This is

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,080
getting more interesting now.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Your house is no longer safe.

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
This is where I stayed
when I first arrived in Jiangnan City.

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,200
You'll stay here from now on.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
Close your eyes first.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,360
Ready?

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Meiying.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Open your eyes.

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
Did you take these photos?

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Of course.

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,840
Have you ever seen a kidnapper

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
who doesn't do his prior works

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
on the target before kidnapping?

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,480
So, you've had a crush
on me for this long?

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,200
How did you figure that out?

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
You took such beautiful photos.

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,360
How could I not be able to feel it?

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,280
Xu Meiying,

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,360

63

I've suspected for a while
that you're Chen Zhuo.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
But why didn't you ever tell me?

65
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,440
Because Chen Yue is too treacherous.

66
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
I was afraid

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
you'd slip up in front of him.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,000
Then, why do you keep provoking me?

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
You made me so paranoid.

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,720
Because I was worried

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,880
you'd expose yourself in front of him.

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,440
So, I had to

73
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,080
subtly remind you.

74
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,200
Chen Yue is merciless.

75
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,000
I was worried about your safety too.

76
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
I didn't want you

77
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,560
to get hurt.

78
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
As long as you're safe,

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm at ease.

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,200
That video was clearly edited
to show only part of the incident.

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,320
We need to find the full version

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
to convict Chen Yue.

83
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,040
My darling, you're so smart.

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
What's your next move?

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm going to use his
scheme of swapping identities

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
against him,

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
make him fell into his own trap.

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,840
Don't worry.

89
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
(I'm going to end this with Chen Yue.)

90
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,880
(He's treacherous.)

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,960
(For your safety's sake,)

92
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
(stay here)

93
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,680
(and wait for my return.)

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,760
No matter how much
you look like my brother,

95
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
you'll never replace him.

96
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,080
Sigh.

97
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,480
You're so tight-lipped, huh?

98
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,520
Even after being beaten like this,

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
you're still so stubborn.

100
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,160
You still able to laugh?

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,640
Still able to laugh now?

102
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Chen Yue,

103
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
are you even a man?

104
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
If you've got guts, come at me.

105
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Chen Zhuo,

106
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,360
I've underestimated you.

107
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,440
I didn't think you'd resist the drugs

108
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
and keep pretending
to be crazy in front of me.

109
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,520
I've never competed
with you for anything.

110
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
Did you think I was weak?

111
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Let me tell you,

112
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,720
