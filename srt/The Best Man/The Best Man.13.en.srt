00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,160
You may get discharged, Chen Zhuo.

4
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,040
Please proceed with the procedure.

5
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,520
Chen Zhuo!

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Are you okay?

7
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,760
My goodness.

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm all fine.

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,640
It's just that my head hurts a bit.

10
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,480
I'm glad that you're alright.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
I hadn't heard from you

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,720
after your confrontation with Chen Yue.

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,360
Are you aware

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,600
I was worried sick about you?

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,800
There, there.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
Everything is okay now.

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
You told me on the phone

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,320
that your mom's death was an accident,

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,680
not your brother's doing.

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,680
In fact, he came clean to me

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800
before the incident.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,080
Both of them were
having a conflict then.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,360
My brother accidentally pushed her.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
That's how my mom

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
ended up falling off the cliff.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,080
If so,

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,840
why did he try to hurt us?

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,720
He'd been stealing things from me
ever since we were kids.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,720
He would destroy

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
whatever I liked.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,440
However, he's lost all of his memory.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
I guess he's had his punishment.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,440
Aren't we going to call the police?

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,720
With him still roaming out there,

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,480
will it pose a danger to us?

36
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Well, well.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Just let it go.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
Though he is evil,

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
he's my brother, after all.

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
Don't worry.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,520
If he ever tried to hurt you,

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,040
I wouldn't let him off for sure.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,640
I know.

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,480
You may appear nonchalant.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
In fact, you are kinder than them all.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
It's alright.

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,840
The kind-hearted

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,440
always make things hard for themselves.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Who am I?

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
Where am I?

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
Why can't I remember anything?

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,240
Mr. Yue.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,600
Looks like Chen Zhuo has
lost his memory.

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
What do we do now?

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
(Chen Zhuo.)

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,920
(From today onward,)

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
(I will take your place.)

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
(Everything you have is now mine.)

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
(That includes Xu Meiying.)

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
This is it?

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Is this my house?

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Yes.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,920
Why can't I recall anything about it?

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,080
You were staying here temporarily.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,960
It's normal
you remember nothing about it.

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Oh, right.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,360
Here.

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,800
Take this medicine.

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
The doctor said this medicine

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
could help you regain your memory soon.

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Here you go.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,480
Thanks.

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,880
Don't mention it.

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,200
Well,

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
I only know my name is Chen Yue.

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
What exactly am I like?

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Well,

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,480
you were the eldest grandson
of the Chen Family of Panlong City.

79
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
However, since young,

80
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,840
everyone showed favoritism
to your twin brother, Chen Zhuo.

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,200
Even your mom

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,760
supported the idea of making
Chen Zhuo the next family patriarch.

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
Your resentment had driven you

84
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,160
into pushing your mom

85
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
off the cliff.

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,920
(The doctor said this medicine)

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
(could help you
regain your memory soon.)

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
(Stop it.)

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
(You've committed a crime here.)

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,000
(Surrender yourself.)

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
Surrender yourself!

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,480
Surrender yourself!

93
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
(No!)

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
No way...

95
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
I didn't do that.

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,760
I didn't do that.

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,040
That's impossible...

98
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,280
I would never do that to my mother.

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,360
No way...

100
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,960
Impossible!

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Aren't you allergic to peanuts?

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,280
Sigh.

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,400
Darn it.

104
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
I actually forgot about the fact
that Chen Zhuo's allergic to peanuts.

105
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
I almost gave myself away.

106
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,760
Hello?

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,240
How's Chen Zhuo doing there?

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,760
Chen Zhuo?

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Are you okay?

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Ah.

111
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,880
Chen Zhuo?

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm okay.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
I'll be fine after the vomiting.

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,640
Don't worry.

115
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,840
Let's go to hospital.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A severe peanut allergy
could cost your life.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,520
There's no need for that.

118
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Open up.

119
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,320
No need!

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
No need.

121
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
I'll be fine after this.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,400
Hello?

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Increase Chen Zhuo's dosage.

124
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,640
But this medicine is still
in the research and development stage.

125
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
One year ago, we used it on Xu Meiying

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
and successfully erased
part of her memory.

127
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Yet Chen Zhuo is
unusually strong-willed.

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,240
We can't guarantee
how things will end up.

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,320
In that case, make him our guinea pig

130
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,280
and destroy all of his will.

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,320
Make him take my place

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,040
by crippling him.

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,680
Why is it quiet in there?

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,520
Are... Are you okay?

135
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,800
Gosh, I'm feeling much better
after the vomiting.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,480
Baby.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,120
Thank you for your reminder.

138
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
I was too focused on the food

139
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
that I forgot about my peanut allergy.

140
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

141
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,880
Okay.

142
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,120
Let me clean up for you.

143
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,120
Wait.

144
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,640
It's not what you should do.

145
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,200
Besides,

146
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
I've cleaned it up.

147
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay.

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
My, my. Don't worry.

149
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm all fine.

150
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
What is this?

151
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
I'm hungry.

152
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,960
Let's eat.

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
(It's all clean.)

154
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Aren't you going to eat?

155
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,160
Nope.

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
All I want is you.

157
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Please don't.

158
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Why?

159
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Aren't we a couple?

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,360
Can't we do this?

161
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,920
Chen Zhuo.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,440
I feel

163
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,360
you haven't been yourself
upon your return.

164
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,880
Are you hiding something from me?

165
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,840
Oh, Meiying.

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,280
The accident has

167
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,200
given a new life.

168
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,720
Trust me.

169
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
You will see

170
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,720
a new version of Chen Zhuo.

171
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,480
I'll go get the door.

172
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,040
You are...

173
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,400
