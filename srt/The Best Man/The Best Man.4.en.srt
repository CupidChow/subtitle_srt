=The Best Man=

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,500
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,910
To convince my parents
that we're a real couple,

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,679
starting today,

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,519
you're living here.

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,439
In the same room as you?

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,110
This is progressing too fast!

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,590
What are you thinking?

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,190
You'll sleep on the floor.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,599
Ouch...

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,910
My back...

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,519
I already hurt during the fight today,

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,350
and now it's worse.

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,350
Your bed is pretty comfortable though.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,599
Humph.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,399
Chen Zhuo,

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
that's fine if you want
to sleep in the bed.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,319
100,000 yuan a night.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,870
Deduct directly from your account.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,559
100,000 yuan a night?

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,479
What kind of bed is this?

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,039
Even our hotel isn't this expensive!

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,830
A luxury villa for a night
isn't worth that price?

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,879
You were so good at analyzing

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,319
our hotel's business issues.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,870
Why are you pretending
to be clueless now?

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,790
Just joking!

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,190
To have a chance to stay
in this free luxury villa,

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,630
even sleeping on the floor

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,319
is worth it.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,950
Please bear with it
for a couple of days.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,959
My parents might come by
for a surprise visit anytime.

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,479
Once they're completely convinced,

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,279
you can move to another room.

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,279
No problem.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,110
When I am at the security booth,
I often slept on the floor.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,350
I'm used to it.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,759
Clean it up yourself.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,110
I'm going to take a shower.

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,039
(The incident of my mom
falling off the cliff a year ago)

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,430
(definitely wasn't an accident.)

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,870
(Xu Meiying was
on the scene at that time.)

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,110
(Perhaps she has some evidence.)

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,999
Yawn.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,150
You two...

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,310
are living together?

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,839
Yes, Mom.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,479
We're living together.

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,630
Xu Meiying, you...

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,110
Chen Zhuo,

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,990
what's your relationship with Mr. Zhang?

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,079
Nothing special.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,919
Yesterday was the first time we met.

54
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,959
True, that's impossible
for a security guard like you

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,999
have any connection with Mr. Zhang.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,439
- Mom!
- You have to leave here!

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,719
This isn't a place
you should be staying.

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,870
- Leave here!
- Mom!

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,279
Jiaqi, don't misunderstand.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,439
Ying, I'm so disappointed in you.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,119
You're living with him now!

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,839
Lin Jiaqi, why are you here?

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,599
I just managed to get
two invitation tickets

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,479
to the Jiangnan Group charity dinner.

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,230
I wanted to bring you along,

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,479
but it looks like there's no need now.

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,670
Jiaqi, Jiaqi...

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,759
Auntie knows you're capable.

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,959
Don't get rushed.

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,750
Ying,

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,439
you must go with Jiaqi tonight.

72
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,399
I won't go.

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,239
If I go, I'll go with Chen Zhuo.

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,079
He's just a security guard.

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,319
What is he going to do there?

76
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,119
Auntie,

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,439
of course, we need a
security guard for an event like that.

78
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,270
Hahaha!

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,439
Lin Jiaqi, don't go overboard.

80
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,190
Excuse me, is Mr. Chen Zhuo here?

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,559
That's me.

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,827
This is your invitation

83
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,350
the Jiangnan Group charity dinner.

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,910
What?

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,710
Chen Zhuo,

86
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,999
This is so fake!

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,550
A SVIP?

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,519
Let's see if you can even get in

89
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,550
with this at tonight's dinner.

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,110
You...

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,879
Sorry.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,990
I didn't expect my mom to deliberately
send the car for maintenance.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,950
Hey, Chen Zhuo.

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,119
Do you still have the nerve
to show up here driving your lousy car?

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
You'd better drive it away

96
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,759
before you embarrass

97
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,879
Ying and yourself.

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,959
Mr. Lin,

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,239
since when did you start
working the same job as me?

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,830
Same job?

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,119
Yeah.

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,399
Standing here as a security guard.

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,270
You...

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,110
Hahaha!

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,879
Oh,

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,959
you're just quick with the words now.

107
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,310
Let's see if you can
actually get inside later.

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,919
Let's go ahead, Mr. Lin.

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,919
Don't bother with
a lowly security guard.

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,759
Fine.

111
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,630
Let's go. Hahaha!

112
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,279
Chen Zhuo,

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,759
I don't have to attend this dinner.

114
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,430
Don't you believe me either?

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,750
I believe you.

116
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,110
Ying,

117
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,679
are you sure he can get us in?

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,519
Of course.

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,670
Yes.

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,150
Of course!

121
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,919
(Jiangnan Group Charity Dinner)

122
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,070
Please.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,710
Let's go.

124
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,310
This is handwritten.

125
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,999
Sorry, this is not our invitation.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,390
You can't get in.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,319
I told you this guy was unreliable!

128
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,879
He is just making us embarrassed.

129
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,679
Ying,

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,870
what's going on?

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,479
Uh...

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,630
It's fine.

133
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,630
Hey, I suggest you

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,150
check with your manager.

135
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,310
Sorry, no exceptions.

136
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:16,010
=The Best Man=

137
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,279
Let them in.

138
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,710
Ah, okay.

139
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,310
Please go in.

140
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,410
(VIP)

141
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,590
Please come here.

142
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,679
The standard for joining
Jiangnan Group's charity dinner

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,270
is getting lower.

144
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,439
They let any riff-raff in.

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,559
Mr. Lin,

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,799
cats have their paths,

147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,119
and dogs have theirs too.

148
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,559
You shouldn't underestimate anyone.

149
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,390
Oh, true.

150
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,799
It turns out that being buddies with a
security guard can get you inside here.

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,799
Lin Jiaqi, stop with the sarcasm.

152
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,830
Ying, let me introduce you.

153
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,759
Mr. Sun from Shengqiang Security.

154
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,159
He's the leader
in the security industry.

155
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,279
Oh yeah,

156
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,799
if Chen Zhuo ever need
a job in the future,

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,959
you can ask Mr. Sun for help.

158
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,719
Hahaha!

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,110
You're right.

160
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,270
Thank you for your support, brother.

161
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,990
How about this?

162
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,390
Let's drink this, brother.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,470
You're being too humble.

164
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,150
Mr. Sun.

165
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,910
Mr. Sun, I've heard so much about you.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,439
You're a senior of marrying in
as a son-in-law.

167
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,110
A true role model for us all.

168
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,790
I need to learn much from you, Mr. Sun.

169
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,030
Oh...

170
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,630
Where's my watch?

171
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,719
It was just here.

172
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,399
It must have been stolen!

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,110
Security guards!

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,359
Mr. Sun's watch is missing.

175
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,990
Please assist with an inspection.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,159
How strange!
There are so many people here.

177
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,239
But why only inspect me?

178
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,759
Everyone else here is
a well-known businessperson.

179
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,519
You're the only one who's just
a security guard who sneaked in here.

180
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,750
It must be you.

181
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,750
Search him!

182
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,550
Hold it!

183
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,239
You have no proof,

184
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,359
but just a one-sided accusation.

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,479
How can you frame others?

186
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,279
Chen Zhuo,

187
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,359
are you feeling guilty and
trying to escape from the search?

188
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,479
Not to the extent of guilt.

189
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,630
How about this?

190
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,759
I don't need your help.

191
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,150
I'll search myself.

192
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,310
Yes.

193
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,950
Waiter.

194
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,599
There's nothing.
Was it a false accusation?

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,830
It wasn't him.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,750
It was completely baseless.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,519
I've proven

198
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,070
that Mr. Sun's watch

199
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,919
is not on me.

200
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,559
For fairness,

201
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,870
shouldn't everyone else
here be searched too?

202
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,390
Yeah, everyone here
should be searched too.

203
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,119
I suggest

204
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,839
we start with the person
standing next to Mr. Sun,

205
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,839
Mr. Lin.

206
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,559
How is it?

207
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,590
Me?

208
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,119
Why would I steal his stuff?

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,639
Why are you so loud?

210
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,910
Are you feeling guilty?

211
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,759
What's my status?

212
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,190
And what's yours?

213
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,479
What's mine?

214
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,150
Regardless your status today,

215
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,830
everyone here should be searched.

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,839
Why is she here?

217
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,119
Isn't she the only granddaughter
of Jiangnan Group's chairman,

218
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,119
Huang Yuhuan?

219
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,390
Unexpectedly.

220
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,559
Ms. Huang,

221
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,199
you accompany the chairman...

222
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,670
Why are you acting familiar with me?

223
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,750
I don't think I know you.

224
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,279
What are you waiting for?

225
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,430
Start searching!

226
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,590
Let's begin with him.

227
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,870
Be gentle.

228
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,790
Here it is.

229
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,759
How...

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,150
How did it end up with me?

231
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,959
Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,839
I left it with Mr. Lin
while washing my hands earlier.

233
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,550
It's just a misunderstanding!

234
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,159
A misunderstanding?

235
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,830
That isn't merely a misunderstanding.

236
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,359
Don't you owe someone an apology?

237
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,190
Alright, Ms. Huang.

238
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,959
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,759
It was my mistake.

240
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,030
My fault.

241
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,630
Mr. Sun,

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,870
your company is in charge
of today's security, right?

243
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,319
If even

244
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,759
you're so careless,

245
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,230
I think Shengqiang's reputation

246
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,270
might get affected too.

247
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,870
Let's leave.

248
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,630
He's right.

249
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,750
Amazing!

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,590
Zhuo!

251
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,990
You're finally here!

252
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,839
Uh, excuse me.

253
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,159
You are...

254
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,670
You don't remember me?

255
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,470
But, I think about you every day.

256
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,150
Chen Zhuo,

257
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,390
aren't you going to introduce me?

258
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,679
Wait.

259
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,279
I don't know her.

260
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,999
Hi,

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,630
I'm the granddaughter
of Jiangnan Group's chairman,

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,910
Huang Yuhuan.

263
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm Xu Meiying,

264
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,630
Chen Zhuo's fiancee.

265
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,470
So, you're not married yet.

266
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,070
That means

267
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,350
