3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,030
Where's my grandma?

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,670
Grandma went back to Panlong City.

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,070
So, you tricked me into coming here.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,910
Tricked you?

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,079
Even though Chen Yue
is now in the vegetative state,

8
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,920
his subordinates have always misbehaved.

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,480
They have been inciting rebellions
in the Chen Family's side branches.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,840
That's why Grandma had to return
and take charge for that.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,710
Chen Zhuo,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,150
I know

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,950
you're worried about Grandma too.

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,150
You're a filial child.

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,000
Please go back as soon as possible
and take over the patriarch position.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,270
Don't make Grandma worry.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,470
Even if I inherit
the patriarch's position,

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
I won't marry you.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,030
The Chen Family values
promise above all else.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,199
If you don't fulfill your promise,

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
I doubt you won't be in the
patriarch's position for long.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,950
How ridiculous!

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,590
I'd never use my marriage

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,030
to secure my status as the patriarch.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,910
Chen Zhuo,

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,270
you can only be mine.

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,039
Dad,

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,750
where are we going?

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,670
Of course, we're moving abroad.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,639
The Chen Family
has acquired Wanlong Hotel,

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,830
with the condition that our
entire family migrated abroad.

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,519
I don't want to go. I dedicate all my
hard work to Wanlong Hotel.

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
I don't want to go anywhere.

34
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,600
The hotel can be exchanged
for a large sum of money.

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,990
With that money,
you can find any man you want.

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,590
I don't want anyone else.
I only want Chen Zhuo.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,239
Dad,

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,830
stop the car.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,199
Chen Zhuo?

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,590
It's the Chen Family who drugged you.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
You still insist on
wanting to be with him.

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,190
Don't force me!

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,590
Hey!

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,630
If you dare to force me again,
I'll end my life right here.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,550
None of you will get
to leave the country.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,559
Xu Meiying.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,550
Go ahead to stab yourself to death.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,359
Let go of me.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,839
Stop it!

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,550
Let go of...

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,790
Hey, Xu Meiying!

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,039
If you get down the car,

53
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,390
you won't be able to see your dad again
once we move abroad.

54
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,750
Dad.

00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,110

Yin Muzi.

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,430
Everybody,

107
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,510
Wanlong Hotel's owner

108
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,750
can only be someone with the surname Xu.

109
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,430
Greetings, Ms, Xu.

110
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,710
Xu Meiying,

111
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,630
you didn't board the plane after all.

112
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,639
I still hold my shares in Wanlong Hotel.

113
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,030
How could I leave?

114
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,879
I'm here

115
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,199
to reclaim the right
to manage the hotel.

116
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,510
Too bad.

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,350
Your parents sold their shares to me

118
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,870
at three times the market price.

119
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,830
Now, I'm the largest
shareholder of Wanlong Hotel.

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,110

The hotel's management rights are on me.

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,790

124
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,910

largest shareholder of Wanlong Hotel.

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,199
With the shares holding
by Jiangnan Group and Meiying,

126
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,559
the management rights belong to us.

127
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,479
You?

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,870
Step aside.

129
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,590
Muzi,

130
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,750
listen to me.

131
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,430
Return to Panlong City.

132
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,350
Chen Zhuo,

133
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,710
you'll regret this.

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,670

Don't mention it, Meiying.

137
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,519
Now, we should decide

138
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,350
on a new chairperson.

139
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,319

management better than I do.
