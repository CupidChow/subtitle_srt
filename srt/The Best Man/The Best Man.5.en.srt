00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,180
=The Best Man=

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,500
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,159
Chairman,

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,510
everyone is here.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,719
Has he arrived?

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,639
Yes, he has.

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,510
Young Lady has already met him.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,870
- Then let's begin.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,479
Welcome, everyone,

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,799
to the Jiangnan Group Charity Gala.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,750
We will now begin
the charity auction segment.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,310
All the auction items have been
provided by the Jiangnan Group.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,959
All proceeds from the auction

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,550
will be donated
to Jiangnan City's charitable causes.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,399
Please

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,919
use your invitation cards

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,230
to participate in the bidding.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,310
This diamond necklace
has a starting bid of 800,000.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,790
Chen Zhuo,

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,430
I'll bid for this necklace
and give it to Ying.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,679
Take a good look around.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,839
This high-class gala isn't a place

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,839
for a lowly security guard like you.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,110
Lin Jiaqi,

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,519
this is about charity,

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,870
not showing off.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,550
Even if you bid on it,
I wouldn't accept it.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,590
Ying,

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,910
what's so good
about a poor guy like him?

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,039
I bet he's never even seen

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,270
an auction like this before.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,390
Let's open his eyes, then, Madam.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,630
One million!

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,599
Impressive.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,670
Two million.

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,559
Chen Zhuo,

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,879
do you even have that kind of money?

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,470
Mind your own business.

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,359
2.2 million.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,190
2.4 million.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,799
Can you afford this?

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,759
Stop messing around.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,630
If you can't pay, don't bid.

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,830
You...

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,190
2.5 million!

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,750
2.5 million, going once.

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,470
Spending 2.5 million on a necklace?

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,199
2.5 million, going twice.

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,070
This guy really is something else.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,750
2.5 million, going thrice.

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,070
Sold!

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,639
Congratulations, Mr. Lin.

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,239
Congratulations, Mr. Lin.

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,430
Congratulations.

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,919
It suits you.

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,790
You...

57
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,919
Let's see what you'll bid

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,710
for Ying tonight.

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,799
This is the final auction item
for the night.

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,159
Only SVIP guests are eligible to bid.

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,550
The starting bid is 40 million.

62
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,239
Who's the SVIP here?

63
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,439
A starting bid this high
and only for the SVIP.

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,519
We're all just VIPs.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,439
Yes, that's right.

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,630
So, who's the SVIP?

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,859
50 million.

68
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,519
(VIP)

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,270
That's crazy!

70
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,750
This must be a joke!

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,910
50 million!

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,399
Do you even have that kind of money?

73
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,399
Hahaha!

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,790
50 million.

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,559
Do you even know how much that is?

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,190
Can you afford it?

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,750
Besides,

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,319
this looks fake.

79
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,799
(VIP)
It's even handwritten!

80
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,310
Hahaha!

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,630
Handwritten!

82
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,310
That handwritten card is valid.

83
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:41,410
=The Best Man=

84
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,279
That's

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,159
Jiangnan Group's Chairman, Huang Qinian!

86
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,559
Chairman Huang has always
kept a low profile

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,799
and stayed behind the scenes.

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,750
Why did he show up tonight?

89
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,150
That handwritten card is valid.

90
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,239
Tonight, the items

91
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,319
won by the SVIP guest

92
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,870
will be paid for

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,319
by the Jiangnan Group.

94
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,999
Wow!

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,590
Chairman Huang is so generous!

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,910
Chairman.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,110
Grandpa.

98
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,710
You're looking sharp tonight.

99
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,110
I see you hold
the Jiangnan Group in high regard.

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,319
Dressing well doesn't matter.

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,550
It won't stop others
from looking down on me.

102
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,719
Oh?

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,439
Is there anyone who would look down

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,230
on the future heir

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,159
of Jiangnan Group?

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,279
The heir of Jiangnan Group?

107
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,790
How could it be him?

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,079
Tell me.

109
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,510
How did you figure out my identity?

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,599
It started when the bracelet

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,479
you gave me

112
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,670
caught Mr. Zhang's attention.

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,470
Mr. Chen, is this...

114
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,967
(VIP)
And he had someone deliver

115
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,639
(VIP)
the invitation to Xu Meiying's place

116
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,110
instead of mine.

117
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,959
Most importantly,

118
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,959
the founder of Jiangnan Group

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,430
also has the surname Huang.

120
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,399
You know me well.

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,719
As expected

122
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,439
of the successor

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,159
I personally selected.

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,190
Don't give me that.

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,550
You're just using me as a shield

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,479
to protect your granddaughter,
Huang Yuhuan.

127
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,390
Talking to smart people

128
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,950
is always a pleasure.

129
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,839
Chen Zhuo.

130
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,830
No.

131
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,230
I should say,

132
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,879
the second son of the Chen Family
in Panlong City,

133
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,230
who has never been publicly revealed,

134
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,750
Chen Zhuo.

135
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,439
What else have you found out?

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,439
Your mother fell to her death
in Jiangnan City a year ago.

137
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,319
The Chen Family sent people
to investigate,

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,719
but it ended without resolution.

139
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,270
The police concluded it was an accident.

140
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,199
Three months ago, you started working

141
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,750
as a security guard at Wanlong Hotel.

142
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,790
I suspect

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,670
my mother's death wasn't an accident.

144
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,270
On the day of the incident,

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,390
there was another man present.

146
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,430
Many years ago,

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,230
your mother helped Jiangnan Group

148
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,910
survive its toughest crisis.

149
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,110
I've been investigating

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,679
her death for the past year.

151
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,310
There should be results soon.

152
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,750
Thank you, Huang.

153
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,110
Chen Zhuo,

154
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,079
after all this is over,

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,710
can you help me support Jiangnan Group?

156
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,719
You know my granddaughter.

157
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,350
She's not cut out for business.

158
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,910
I'm sorry.

159
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,359
I can't take over

160
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,590
Jiangnan Group.

161
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,950
Why not?

162
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,230
So many are eager
to align themselves with Jiangnan Group.

163
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,670
Why don't you want it?

164
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,510
Well?

165
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,870
The reason?

166
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,550
The reason is...

167
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,630
I simply don't need it.

168
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,550
But thanks for the offer.

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,510
Grandpa,

170
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,350
I like the match you arranged for me

171
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,590
this time.

172
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,950
Too bad, though.

173
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,110
He's already taken.

174
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,390
That's all right.

175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,230
I can take him down.

176
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,070
Chen Zhuo, let's talk.

177
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,310
About what?

178
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,270
About Huang Yuhuan?

179
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,519
Are you jealous?

180
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,430
Why would I be jealous?

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,150
I just want to know who you really are.

182
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,519
My name is Chen Zhuo.

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,990
I'm a small-time security guard
at Wanlong Hotel.

184
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,199
There's no way
you're just a security guard.

185
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,990
I ran a background check on you.

186
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,670
Nothing showed up.

187
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,039
You investigated me?

188
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,199
Because I don't understand

189
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,270
why you're working
as a security guard at our hotel.

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,239
Look.

191
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,079
Even the Chairman of Jiangnan Group

192
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,199
can work as a security guard
at Wanlong Hotel.

193
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,070
Why can't I?

194
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,439
Don't underestimate
the role of a security guard.

195
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,630
It's full of hidden talents.

196
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,239
(Brain Examination Report)

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,710
Stress-induced
short-term memory impairment.

198
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,439
Looks like Xu Meiying
really doesn't remember

199
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,350
what happened back then.

200
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,710
Chen Zhuo?

201
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,119
Why aren't you asleep
in the middle of the night?

202
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,830
What are you doing in the living room?

203
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,439
I'm experiencing what it's like

204
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,390
to sit on a rich person's couch.

205
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,430
It's very comfortable.

206
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,350
I feel like your purpose

207
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,830
for joining Wanlong Hotel isn't simple.

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,279
I joined to get close to you, of course.

209
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,439
After all,

210
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,630
you're the boss
who can pay me 40,000 a month.

211
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,510
That's only because
you kept pestering me.
