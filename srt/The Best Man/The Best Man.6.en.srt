Listen here.

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,559
Be more precise.

48
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,150
Seriously?

49
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,710
Well, well, Dao.

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,199
I've given you many chances.

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,679
Who does Chen Zhuo he is?

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,919
He's just a stupid security guard.

53
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,799
Ha ha ha!

54
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,399
Do you know what you look like?

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,239
You look just like a clown now.

56
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,079
I'm telling you.

57
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,790
You are less than a security guard.

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,079
That's why Wanlong Group's owner has

59
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,279
taken a liking to my boss.

60
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,799
Huh? Ha ha ha!

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,750
Don't you try anything funny!

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,919
Your boss, huh?

63
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,990
I dare him to come here!

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,310
I'm here!

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,190
If I hadn't shown up,

66
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,230
all of your efforts here
would've gone to waste.

67
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,239
Don't just stand there.

68
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,150
Charge!

69
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,390
Ah!

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,719
You're quite something else, Chen Zhuo.

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,190
You like it this way, huh?

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,070
Let's do it this way, then.

73
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,790
Watch out, Chen Zhuo!

74
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,390
Chen Zhuo.

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,110
Chen Zhuo...

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,719
If it weren't for you,

77
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,910
Ying and I would've
tied the knot long ago!

78
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,879
I'm warning you, Lin Jiaqi.

79
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,350
Hands off my man.

80
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,159
I've told you this time after time.

81
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,110
It's not going to work out between us.

82
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,670
Ying.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
I truly fancy you.

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,599
I...

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,670
What did you just say?

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,550
Don't you get her words?

87
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,550
Well, let me say this again.

88
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,590
She belongs to me.

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,719
As long as I'm still in Jiangnan City,

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,390
you don't get to have a foothold here.

91
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,750
Stop lying there. Get up!

92
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,630
Chairman.

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,519
The surveillance footage
of Sunset Beach you were seeking

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,119
have all been erased.

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,670
We only managed to find
this dashcam footage nearby.

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,599
You may leave.

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,750
Yes.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,750
(It's him?)

99
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,870
Ms. Xu.

100
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,110
Why did you show up there?

101
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,199
I was there

102
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,710
because I was worried about you.

103
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,150
For real?

104
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,510
Shush.

105
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,039
What's it?

106
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,310
Does it hurt a lot?

107
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,390
I'm okay.

108
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,630
It doesn't hurt at all.

109
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,510
Ms. Xu.

110
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,190
Why have you been so kind to me today?

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,470
Of course it's due to our contract.

112
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,710
(Huang)
I need to answer this.

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,839
Hello?

114
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,839
Come here at once, Chen Zhuo.

115
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,999
There's some clue to your investigation.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,310
Okay, got it.

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,110
I'm heading out.

118
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,470
Huang.

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,950
Huang.

120
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,710
Huang.

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,719
Huang.

122
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,870
What's the matter?

123
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,390
Wake up.

124
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,350
Look after Huan

125
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,879
for me.

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,439
What?

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,199
Look after Huan...

128
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,350
I promise you.

129
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,439
The flash drive...

130
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,590
Flash drive?

131
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,910
The flash drive...

132
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,830
Huang!

133
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,870
(Chen Zhuo.)

134
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,550
(I'm aware of my terminal illness.)

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,950
(I have only a few months to live.)

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,030
(Yet my only concern is)

137
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,470
(that dearest granddaughter of mine.)

138
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
(I've observed you for three months)

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,630
(and come to know)

140
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,110
(that you're nothing but loyal.)

141
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,390
(I hope you can look after Huan for me)

142
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,230
(when I'm gone.)

143
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,630
(Please.)

144
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,759
My grandfather is gone!

145
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,070
Ah!

146
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,110
Ah!

147
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,319
Haven't you been wondering

148
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,750
why I decided to be a security guard
at Wanlong Hotel?

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,390
One year ago, my mom died after
falling off a cliff at Sunset Beach.

150
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,430
I doubt her death was an accident.

151
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,590
Did you say I was there
during the incident?

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,750
Yes.

153
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,559
Thus, I want to know

154
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,990
every detail of your appearance
at Sunset Beach one year ago.

155
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,839
I'm sorry,

156
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,430
but I can't help you with that.

157
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,199
I was too shocked back then.

158
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,190
So I can't remember much about that day.

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,750
It's okay.

160
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,110
You just have to...

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,030
(This face...)

162
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,470
(Why does he look exactly like)

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,390
