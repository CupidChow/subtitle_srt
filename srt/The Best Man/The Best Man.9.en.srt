00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,290
Shame!

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,990
How shameless of you!

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,750
(Xu, The Homewrecker)
You homewrecker! Shame!

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,199
You homewrecker!

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,350
Are you alright?

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,550
I'm okay. Thanks.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,999
How shameless of you!

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,070
Shame!

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,630
You have no shame!

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,510
What is all this?

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,190
Leave.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,239
She deserves all reprimands.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,960
Let's go. Serves her right.

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,750
Find out

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,310
who is behind it.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,830
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,119
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,910
Call me if you need my help again.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,279
What good does it do to me
by defaming Xu Meiying?

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,239
After all, Zhuo is not into me.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,030
Of course it'll do you good.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,750
Xu Meiying's biggest weak spot is
Wanlong Hotel.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,470
With the havoc wreaked,

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,710
if Wanlong Hotel is closed down
because of her,

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,239
she will be in deep water.

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,270
Isn't that your chance
to make your move?

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,479
Tell the HR department
to perform crisis communication

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,179
and stop the spread
of rumors online at once.

33
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:16,230
Yes, Ms. Xu.

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,079
Look what you've done.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,039
We can't run the hotel at all.

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,119
What mistake have I made, Mom?

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,999
Aren't you stubborn?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,990
What's so good
about that trivial security guard?

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,280
Since Huang Yuhuan fancies him,
just let her have him.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,960
Instead, you insist
on fighting over him.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,559
And you're being a homewrecker now.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,799
We can't run the business at all.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,999
Are you happy now?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,239
We're not fighting over him.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,560
Someone is behind all this,
and they try to defame me.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,199
Just shut up already, Xu Meiying.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,279
Listen here.

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,679
What you need to do now is

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
end things with him at once.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,399
Make it our bargaining chip

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,439
to make Huang Yuhuan
invest in our hotel.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,470
Otherwise,
we will have to close down the hotel.

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,919
You have one day

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,519
to get rid of all the online news

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,759
against Xu Meiying

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,599
and Wanlong Hotel.

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,990
No problem. It takes less than one day
to deal with that.

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,950
Yet the Chen Family should have
your whereabouts figured out.

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,510
I already expected that.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,319
Regarding my mom's death,

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,230
I must get to the bottom of it.

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,110
Chen Zhuo.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,270
Thank you for your care and company
all this while.

64
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,030
You've made up your mind?

65
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,630
Yes.

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,830

I'll take it from here.

87

I don't think
that's appropriate, Ms. Huang.

I'm not going to eat him alive.

Here.

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,790
No problem.

92
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,670
Slowly.

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,999

94

This is bad, Meiying.

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,959
I've just learned that Lin Jiaqi hired
a bunch of reporters,

98
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,600
and they're on their way
to Wanlong Hotel.

99
