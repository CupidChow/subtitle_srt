3
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,890
Meiying.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,719
Zhuo said he would take care of me,

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,950
so I'm moving in to live with you two!

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,759
This is my house,

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,639
not Chen Zhuo's house.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,879
Now, please take your things and leave.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,919
Xu Meiying,

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,599
Ms. Huang is my honored guest.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,959
She's our financial savior.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,799
I won't forgive you if you dare offend her.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,790
Mom!

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,630
Huang Yuhuan.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,550
Zhuo!

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,319
Zhuo, you're my only support now.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,639
So I want to move in and live with you.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,799
Stop acting spoiled.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,910
This is the Xu Family's house, not mine.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,470
Move aside.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,150
We've agreed.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,190
Ms. Huang can stay as long as she wants.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,350
Isn't that right, Meiying?

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,790
Ahh!

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,030
Yuhuan!

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,510
Yuhuan!

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,070
What's wrong?

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,630
Zhuo,

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,079
ever since Grandpa passed away,

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,879
I've been all alone

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,239
in that house.

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,990
I'm so scared.

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,879
Don't be scared. We're all here for you.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,839
You're not alone in this house.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,150
You can rest peacefully here.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,279
Then can you stay and keep me company?

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,310
Huang Yuhuan,

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,279
this is my house.

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,390
Don't push your luck.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,710
I'm just scared

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,439
and want someone to stay with me.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,430
Scared, huh?

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,119
I'll stay with you.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,439
Who wants you to stay?

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,879
I only want Zhuo.

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,670
Ask him if he dares.

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,799
We can both stay with you.

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,599
That way, no one will feel scared.

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,350
Not even Yuhuan.

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,590
That works.

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,790
Zhuo, you can sleep here.

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,839
I have no objections.

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,430
I like sleeping in the middle.

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,550
Then I'll sleep by the edge.

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,070
Move in a little.

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,190
Let's sleep.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,939
Did you need something?

58
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,439
I noticed you seem
a little unusual today.

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,350
Unusual?

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,230
How?

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,590
Unusually cute.

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,959
Don't laugh.

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,270
Are you okay?

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,439
I have something

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,599
very, very, very important

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,799
to tell you today.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,750
I've discovered

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,119
that I have a superpower.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,990
Stop.

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,270
Never use those lines on me again.

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,030
Are you still mad?

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,510
Do you still want to break the contract?

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,790
We'll see how you behave.

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,759
As long as we haven't canceled
the contract,

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,150
you'll remain
my security-guard boyfriend.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,679
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,430
Captain, there's someone in the lobby
asking for you. Please come quickly.

78
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,590
I'll be right there.

79
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,470
By the way, Xu Meiying,

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,919
Dao taught me

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,519
those lines.

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,670
I'm not responsible for them.

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,550
What's gotten into him today?

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,590
(I have a superpower.)

85
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,270
(I super like you.)

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,790
What a scene! Look at the crowd!

87
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,159
Yes.

88
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,260
She's making a statement for sure.
It's unbelievable.

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,310
Huang Yuhuan, what are you doing now?

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,390
Zhuo, I'm officially telling you

91
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,199
I like you.

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,950
I want you to be my boyfriend.

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,870
It's the heiress and the security guard!

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,559
If you agree,

95
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,599
you'll never have to wear
that security uniform again.

96
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,510
You can wear
custom-tailored suits from now on.

97
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,719
If you don't like
these watches and diamonds,

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,879
I can even give you an island.

99
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,239
No, that won't be necessary.

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,870
I like my current security uniform.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,150
Why?

102
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,919
Why would you rather be a security guard

103
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,470
than agree to be with me?

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,390
Ms. Huang,

105
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,310
there are too many eyes watching us.

106
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,750
Let's go talk somewhere else.

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,710
Come on.

108
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,190
Stop making a scene, Ms. Huang.

109
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,439
Who's making a scene?

110
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,119
I'm not.

111
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,439
I genuinely like you.

112
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,990
But I don't like you.

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,639
I'm cute.

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,839
You'll fall for me eventually.

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,639
Not a chance.

116
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,559
Your grandfather and I
were close friends.

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,550
His granddaughter is like
my own granddaughter.

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,119
Chen Zhuo,

119
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,159
I see you as my boyfriend,

120
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,870
but you see me as your granddaughter?

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,150
Fine.

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,839
All right.

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,190
I see how it is.

124
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,790
Mr. Yue, no one knows his true identity
while he's here.

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,119
Should we make a move now?

126
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,679
It's better if we don't dirty our hands.

127
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,950
If that old lady investigates,
it'll be troublesome.

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,110
After all,
we're supposed to be brothers.

129
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,030
We only need to ruin his reputation

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,350
so he can never return
to the Chen Family.

131
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,110
Understood.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,799
Have you seen the news?

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,399
They're saying Ms. Xu is a mistress

134
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,559
who came between
Chen Zhuo and Huang Yuhuan.

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,030
Their love triangle is making headlines.

136
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,199
You're shameless!

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,270
You homewrecker!

138
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,319

139

Shameless!
