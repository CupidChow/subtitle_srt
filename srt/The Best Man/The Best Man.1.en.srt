=The Best Man=

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,500
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,159
Mr. Yue,

4
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,740
the old madam issued a reward notice.

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,420
Whoever finds the second young master
will be rewarded 100 million.

6
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,479
May the ancestors of the Chen Family

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,079
bless my grandson Chen Zhuo

8
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,260
to return safely.

9
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,759
Chen Yue,

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,780
what are you trying to do?

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,660
Grandma,

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,440
(Chen Yue, Eldest Son of the Chen Family)
Chen Zhuo has been missing for a long time.

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,480
Shouldn't I become the patriarch
of the Chen Family by now?

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,279
He's missing,

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,599
not dead.

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,399
I've said it before.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,140
Only Chen Zhuo can be
the patriarch of the Chen Family.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,180
Anyone with objections
will be expelled from the Chen family.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,119
(After three months,)

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,879
(if Chen Zhuo doesn't return,)

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,540
(I, Chen Yue, will be
the patriarch of the Chen family.)

22
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,119
(Chen Zhuo, Second Son
of the Chen Family)

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,940
Hey,

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,039
you can't park here!

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,880
Go to the parking lot
if you want to park.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,220
Huang!

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,639
Are you here to work?

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,100
Or are you here to retire?

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,359
You rude man!

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,119
Your yelling

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,719
has ruined my deal worth millions.

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,559
Forget it.

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,660
It's your shift now.

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,040
(Valet Parking Service)

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,639
(It's been three months.)

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,220
(There are still no clues
about the truth of my mom's death.)

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,060
(It seems I can only start
with Xu Meiying.)

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,799
Hey!

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,719
Chen Zhuo!

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,599
Are you secretly

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,799
crushing on Ms. Xu?

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,959
This is my ex-girlfriend.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,919
She just looks like her.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,159
This is Ms. Xu.

45
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,500
Give it back to me!

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,660
Hey you!

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,239
Give it back to me!

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,920
- Huang!
- I don't want to give it to you.

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,620
Give it to me!

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,580
Ms. Xu.

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,359
Good morning.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,780
Our hotel doesn't need
such grand courtesy.

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,380
Morning, Ms. Xu.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,420
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,839
Regarding the investment
in our Wanlong Hotel,

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,399
can we meet to discuss it?

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,060
I've specially prepared
a small gift for you.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,620
It's my pleasure.

59
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,319
Alright.

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,620
I'll wait for your news.

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,620
Don't move.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,460
We've got it.

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,620
This woman is so beautiful.

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,500
I wonder how charming she is.

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,079
A rich and pretty female boss,

66
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,100
of course, she's very charming.

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,559
Who are you?

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,039
If you don't want to die,
get out of here now!

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,999
Why are you so worked up?

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,159
My buddies.

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,039
I'm just passing by.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,140
Chen Zhuo!

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,700
You...

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
You don't want your salary
this month, do you?

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,580
Oh yeah!

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,860
She's my boss.

77
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,660
Get out of here!

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Ahhh!

79
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,180
Ahhh!

80
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,260
Go chase him!

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,119
No need.

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,479
The mastermind behind them

83
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,980
will reveal themselves soon.

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,999
Thankfully, this precious thing is safe.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,439
What are you doing with this fake cup?

86
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,319
This is for...

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,540
A fake one?

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,860
Yeah.

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,399
Oh!

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,079
Ms. Xu,

91
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,399
for this Chenghua Doucai Chicken Cup,

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,839
whether it's the texture, shape, glaze,

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,780
or the artwork,

94
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,300
everything proves it's authentic.

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,660
Thank you, expert.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,500
- This is the appraisal fee for you.
-  Alright.

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,439
Ms. Xu,

98
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,399
let me temporarily hold onto
this money for you.

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,039
Please allow me

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,020
to tell you the facts of this cup.

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:32,360
=The Best Man=

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,359
I was wondering

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,439
who was arrogant.

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,420
It turns out it's just a security guard.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,319
What?

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,919
Even a security guard can
pretend to be an expert now?

107
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,260
I dare not claim to be an expert.

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,860
I just know a little.

109
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
A security guard knows nothing.

110
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,359
Do you even know 1+1 equals 2?

111
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,319
Hey buddy,

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,399
this isn't a place

113
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,740
for someone of your status.

114
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,820
Be smart and leave now.

115
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,799
Are you afraid

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,319
that I'll reveal the truth?

117
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,959
You stupid security guard,
don't make a mess!

118
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,679
If you can't point out
what's wrong with this cup,

119
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,359
you'll have to crawl
out of here like a toad.

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,079
If I am able to tell it,

121
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,879
then give me that vase in front of you.

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,559
That's a Qing Dynasty
gold-painted enamel vase,

123
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,039
worth 2 million.

124
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,140
You've got guts, man!

125
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,679
Fine!

126
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,559
But if you can't point it out,

127
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,079
can you even afford it?

128
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,639
I trust my employee.

129
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,959
If he can't tell it,

130
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,740
I'll pay for the vase.

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,580
Ms. Xu,

132
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,359
thank you.

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,460
Excuse me.

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,119
A fake will always be fake.

135
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,500
On the surface, it looks fancy.

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,100
But,

137
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,780
the details inside...

138
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,959
Ancient ceramics have
pure green and yellow glazes

139
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,340
with consistent density.

140
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,359
But for this one, its green and yellow
glazes have visible impurities,

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,940
and the density is uneven.

142
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,340
So...

143
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,999
This is obviously a modern

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,180
high-quality replica.

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,860
There are impurities.

146
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,039
How could this be?

147
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,980
So, may I take this vase now?

148
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,279
Hahaha.

149
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,980
Hey buddy, where are you from?

150
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,719
Take it as a token of friendship.

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,039
I dare not claim to be a god.

152
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm just Ms. Xu's

153
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,220
humble security guard.

154
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,980
Ahhh!

155
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,660
Oh!

156
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,719
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

157
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,119
We didn't expect

158
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,159
that a security guard
could ruin our plans.

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,799
That guard is too skilled.

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,780
I couldn't beat him.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,119
Ahhh...

162
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,620
Trash belongs in the trash can.

163
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,439
I'd like to see

164
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,540
what this security guard is capable of.

165
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,820
I never expect a security guard
to have such a skill.

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,919
So,

167
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,159
you already knew that the vase was fake,

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,399
and you requested it to destroy it?

169
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,119
Someone sincerely wants to make friends,

170
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,119
I have

171
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,540
to return the favor.

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,780
Ying,

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,359
I heard that you were robbed.

174
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,319
Are you okay?

175
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,740
Lin Jiaqi, how did you know that?

176
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,100
I'm always looking out for you.

177
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,980
Ying,

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,159
once we're married,

179
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,860
I'll cover all of
Wanlong Hotel's financial losses.

180
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,559
So,

181
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,820
you won't have to send
gifts to Jiangnan Group.

182
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,580
Do you know I was...

183
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,780
Mr. Lin,

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,479
how did you know

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,780
Ms. Xu sent a gift?

186
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,740
Did you arrange the two robbers?

187
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,199
Who are you?
Is this any of your business?

188
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,900
He's my fiance.
