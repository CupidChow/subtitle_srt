3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,520
Are you realizing

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
that I'm the one
who actually makes your heart race?

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,040
Are you really Chen Zhuo?

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,680
Yes.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,800
I am Chen Zhuo.

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,840
I knew it.

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,320
Do you know who I am?

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,200
I grew up with you brothers.

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,160
Of course, I know.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,960
You are my Yue.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,560
Why did you return to the country?

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,520
Because you were going
to marry another woman.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,560
Do you want her,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,240
or do you want me?

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,720
I want both.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,800
I want everything
that belongs to Chen Zhuo.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,120
Greedy.

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,400
You're so naive and gullible.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
What do you mean?

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,160
A name is just a label.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,680
You can call me whatever you want.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,480
Xu Meiying,

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
if you become mine…

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Let go of me!

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,960
Let go!

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,240
You two brothers are so amusing.

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,000
Fighting over things so obsessively

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,240
that now you're fighting over women.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
Is this fun?

32
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,280
You lunatic!

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,400
(I'm sorry, Meiying.)

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,200
(For your safety,)

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
(I can't let you know who I am yet.)

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,160
Oh, you.

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,600
You deserved that.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Didn't you ask me
if fighting over women was fun?

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,120
Mm-hm.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,360
Of course, it's fun.

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,360
After all, I took you from him.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,760
From today on,

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
Yin Muzi will live here.

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,320
If there's nothing else, you may leave.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,600
But…

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,480
Ms. Yin is the future matriarch
of the family.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,360
Mr. Yue, isn't this inappropriate?

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,880
I'm the future family head.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,040
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,120
Yes.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
You're the future family head.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,720
You are.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
Then why are you still standing here?

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
Thank you for helping me.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,280
It's getting late.

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
If there's nothing else,

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
you should leave too.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,280
We haven't seen each other in so long.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,760
Don't you miss me?

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,400
You've got it wrong.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,400
I am

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Chen Zhuo.

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Not Chen Yue.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,720
Chen Yue has gone through
so much trouble to take your woman.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,480
Don't you want to try

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
taking his woman?

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm not interested.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Then are you interested
in the position of family head?

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,520
Family head?

70
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,040
Well, I wasn't interested before.

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
But now I am.

72
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,720
Then you can only be mine.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,920
After all,

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm the future matriarch of the family.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,920
But I can change
the rules of succession.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,680
Zhuo,

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,560
I've liked you since we were kids.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,800
Why do you always keep me
at arm's length?

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,240
Muzi.

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,120
I really don't understand you.

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,000
You were with my brother.

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
So why now

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,800
are you so infatuated with me?

84
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,160
We grew up together.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,160
Do you really

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,440
have no feelings for me at all?

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
I really don't.

88
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
I see you as family,

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
as a friend,

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,040
but never as a lover.

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
My only love is Xu Meiying.

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
Aren't you afraid

93
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,840
I'll tell Chen Yue
that you're not actually

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,720
suffering from amnesia?

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
You won't.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
If you were going to,

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
you would've already done it.

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,720
Muzi,

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
you're smart.

100
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,160
But I have to remind you.

101
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,040
Don't let your intelligence
backfire on you.

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't worry.

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
I won't get involved
in your brotherly feud.

104
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,960
Having been adopted by the Chen family
for so many years,

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,200
I've learned the value
of self-preservation.

106
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,560
Mr. Yue.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
Xu Meiying went to test Chen Zhuo.

108
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,200
However,
Chen Zhuo acted so deeply in character

109
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,840
that it eased her suspicions.

110
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,120
That woman has been testing me
for so long

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,840
and still doesn't trust me.

112
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,240
Meiying.

113
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
Weren't you supposed
to stay at the hotel?

114
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,640
Why did you come back?

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,800
I missed you,

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,120
so I came back.

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,080
Oh.

118
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm sorry,

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
Meiying.

120
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,120
I planned a proposal today,

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,200
but it was ruined
by Chen Yue and Yin Muzi.

122
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,160
It's not your fault.

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,040
But

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,320
if you want to inherit
the position of family head,

125
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,000
you'll have to marry Yin Muzi.

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
If…

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,720
If it really comes to that,

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
I'd rather give up the position

129
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
than give up on you.

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
(Ms. Xu.)

131
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,200
(I suggest you open your eyes.)

132
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,720
(Look carefully.)

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,600
(Is the man really the one you want?)

134
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,760
(Yes.)

135
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,720
(I am Chen Zhuo.)

136
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,880
It seems things aren't
as simple as I thought.

137
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,160
Why are you drinking alone?

138
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Hm?

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
Shall I join you?

140
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
Okay.

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,720
What are you looking for?

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,280
Chen Yue has a twisted habit.

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,560
He likes to collect memorabilia
of his "masterpieces."

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,160
I've seen him, alone,
savoring and reminiscing over them.

145
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Do you know where he keeps
these pieces of evidence?

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
No.

147
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Is that why you're pretending
to be Chen Yue?

148
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,760
He must be lying.

149
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
He definitely had something to do

150
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,520
with Mom's death.

151
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Otherwise,
he wouldn't go to such lengths

152
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,640
to harm Huang and Xu Meiying.

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,400
You seem to know him well.

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,280
I never wanted

155
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,160
to compete with him before.

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,960
But I have principles,

157
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
and he's crossed my line.

158
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
You're searching in the wrong place.

159
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,840
His most important things

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,040
are always with him.

161
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,040
(Things he carries with him?)

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
(He just drank the sleeping aid.)

163
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,680
(He shouldn't wake up for a while.)

164
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,920
(This is Chen Zhuo's tablet.)

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,240
(It's fingerprint-locked.)

166
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
(If I can see whether it unlocks,)

167
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,720
(I'll know if he's really Chen Zhuo.)

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
