You are...

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,120
Chen Yue?

5
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,520
(What's the matter?)

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
(Are you scared of lightning?)

7
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,600
(My mom passed away
during a thunderstorm.)

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,240
Afraid not.

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Let go!

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,200
Don't be afraid.

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm right here.

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,920
It's alright.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,520
I'm right here.

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,320
Meiying...

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,360
Let go!

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,640
(Why does he)

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,920
(speak and act)

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,320
(just like Chen Zhuo?)

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,160
Chen Yue.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,200
How dare you show up here?

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,680
What am I doing here?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
Where am I?

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm warning you.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Stay away from Xu Meiying.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
Don't ever come and bother us again.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Leave!

you cannot meet up with Chen Yue alone.

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Understand?

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Chen Zhuo.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
What's wrong with you?

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
You're hurting me.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm just worried about you, Meiying.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
Are you aware how dangerous Chen Yue is?

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,080
I don't want you to get hurt.

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,720
I was too loud

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,160
that you were shocked.

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,960
Can you forgive me?

45
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,220
(Wanlong Hotel)

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey, Boss!

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
Good grief, my boss!

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
I've missed you so much!

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
You knew you'd survive it.

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,960
Watch your word.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,840
Wait,

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Boss.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,920
Can't you recognize me?

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Well... What injury have you had?

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm fine.

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
It was a minor one.

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,840
Hey,

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,920
you.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,640
Go

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
park my car.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm not obligated to do so.

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,440
Who do you think you are, huh?

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Watch your mouth.

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,360
It's none of your business!

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
You are nothing but a watchdog.

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,080
You...

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,920
Let... Let go!

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
Stop it, Boss.

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,400
You're breaking his finger.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,200
Just you wait!

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,040
I...

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,640
Baby.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
What are you up to?

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,800
What's the matter?

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,080
Chen Zhuo.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Why did you get mad
at that couple today?

77
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
I feel you're a different person now.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Isn't it great?

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Only by getting stronger

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,040
will they not bully us.

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
Am I right?

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,800
Get that out of your head.

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Here's a kiss for you.

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,880
I think

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,240
we should sleep in different bedrooms.

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm still not used to it.

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,040
Baby.

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,240
How about this?

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
I swear.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
I will not

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,400
lose my temper with anyone again.

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Okay?

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,880
(Tonight, I will find out)

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,840
(who is putting on an act here.)

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
(In terms of appearance,
we are basically the same.)

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
(Yet personality wise,
we are vastly different.)

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
(I have a birth mark on my waist.)

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
(He doesn't have one.)

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,000
(Has this been my misjudgment?)

101
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,600
(He's really Chen Zhuo.)

102
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Baby.

103
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
Why are you so eager?

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Hold on.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
Well, Mr. Yue,

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,680
do you have to go this far?

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,640
We need to make sure
everything is meticulous.

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,120
Xu Meiying is not to be underestimated.

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Understood.

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,720
(Xu Meiying.)

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
(Little did I expect)

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
(that you remained skeptical.)

113
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,360
(Stop it.)

114
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,360
(You've committed a crime here.)

115
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,440
(Surrender yourself.)

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,600
(Surrender yourself.)

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
Surrender yourself!

118
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,120
No!

119
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,320
No!

120
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,480
(Perhaps this is the best opportunity)

121
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,720
(to get rid of this trouble
for Mr. Yue.)

122
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,400
Why did I end up this way?

123
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,640
Why did I...

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Why?

125
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
What's it?

126
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,280
You've regained some of your memory,
and you cannot take it anymore?

127
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:43,960
Huh?

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
Bear this in mind.

129
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
You are now Chen Yue.

130
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Chen Yue who achieves his goals
by all means.

131
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
And that's not
the only bad thing you did.

132
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,800
You are now Chen Yue.

133
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,480
You are Chen Yue!

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
Shut your mouth!

135
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,560
My goodness.

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,640
You can't take it anymore?

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
Just take your own life, then.

138
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
Just end things for good.

139
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
But would you dare to do that?

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,280
Look at me.

141
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,120
Look at yourself.

142
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
You are nothing but a coward

143
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,680
and a loser!

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
Get lost!

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440

I... I'm sorry.

150

You called me evil.

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
