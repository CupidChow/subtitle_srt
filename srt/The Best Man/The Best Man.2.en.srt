=Episode 2=

3
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,039
Here's 30,000 yuan.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,800
Pretend to be my fiance for a month.

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,839
Ms. Xu, that's my first kiss.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,920
Don't try to brush me off
with so little money.

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,200
So, what should I do?

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,599
40,000 yuan?

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,919
40,000 isn't enough either.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,080
Sorry, I sell skills, not myself.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,240
What are your conditions?

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,199
As long as it's a fair deal,

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,960
I'll agree to anything.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Now that, it's fair.

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
We can discuss the deal now.

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,520
Say what you want.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,280
What do I want?

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,879
I need to think about it carefully.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm thinking...

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,859
If you can cover food and board?

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,380

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,319

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,800
Let's see how you perform.

(Party B: Chen Zhuo)

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,840
Happy cooperation.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Happy cooperation.

28
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,860
(Wanlong Hotel)

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,320
Oh my goodness.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,839
Clothes make the man.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,280
You're so handsome!

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,639
Here's 40,000 yuan.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,719
It's for your granddaughter's

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
study fee.

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
So much money?

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,799
Did you sell yourself?

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,920
Did you win the lottery?

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Or are you the illegitimate child
of Panlong in the Chen Family?

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,519
I have the surname, but not the fate.
Do you want it? If not, I'll take it back.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,319
Of course,

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,240
I want it.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,959
I'm not an old man who owes anyone.

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,320
This string of beads
is my family heirloom.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Consider it yours.

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
I'll take it.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,559
Alright, I get to go.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,599
Today,

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to be a live-in son-in-law.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,559
We've confirmed
that Chen Zhuo is in Jiangnan City,

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,080
and he's with Wanlong Group's
General Manager, Xu Meiying.

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
(Chen Zhuo)

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
(Xu Meiying)

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,639
Do you know what to say later?

54
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,599
Three months ago, I became
a security guard. We fell in love at first sight,

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,039
but kept it a secret.

56
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,599
Just yesterday,

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,399
you proposed to me.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
And, I agreed.

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,520
Who proposed to whom?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,760
It doesn't matter.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,440
- You.
- Sigh.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll be the one
who proposes from now on.

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,720
Carry on your act when you get home.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,079
Jiaqi,

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,599
we're all family now.

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,360
You don't need to be so formal,

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,640
giving us so many expensive gifts.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
Uncle, Auntie,

69
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,080
these are my gestures of respect.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
I'm just worried about Ying

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,319
being deceived by that security guard.

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't worry.

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,999
If that security guard
dares step into my house,

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,719
I'll beat him out.

75
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,879
Great, beat him out.

76
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Dad, Mom.

77
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:44,180
=The Best Man=

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,000
This is my fiance, Chen Zhuo.

79
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,640
Mom!

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,319
He's your fiance?

81
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,919
He's just a security guard
with a pay of 3000 yuan from us.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,640
How can he compare to Jiaqi?

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
So what if he's a security guard?

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,679
In my eyes,

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,799
he's better than someone else.

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,679
Ying,

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,599
you're not my biological daughter,

88
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,679
but I raised you as my own.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
When have you ever treated me
like your own daughter?

90
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,519
You...

91
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Ying,

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,079
mind your manners with your mom.

93
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,000
She's doing this for your sake.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,880
Uncle, Auntie, don't be mad.

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
Chen Zhuo, right?

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,079
Sigh.

97
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,639
Do you think you become better

98
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,320
by just changing your outfit?

99
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
Do you deserve it?

100
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,760
Don't mess with people
you shouldn't mess with.

101
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,039
Xu Meiying,

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,039
this is your fiance?

103
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,359
He's so uncivilized.

104
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,040
Mom, mind your words.

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,119
Auntie,

106
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,479
if there's an issue,

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,720
direct it at me.

108
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,400
Oh, you are so eager, huh?

109
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Are you trying to take
the advantage over her?

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,880
Are you coveting our money?

111
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
Is 10,000 enough?

112
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,200
Mom!

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
20,000 yuan?

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,920
Mom, what are you doing?

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
30,000 yuan?

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,919
That's still not enough.

117
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,400
Don't go overboard.

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
How much do you want?

119
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,279
That's not the case.
It's not about money, Auntie.

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,879
I'm interested in

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
your jade bracelet.

122
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
How dare you dream of this!

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,079
This bracelet...

124
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,079
Jiaqi bought it for over
a million yuan for me.

125
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,320
Auntie,

126
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,119
as long as Ying can be set free
from this shameless man,

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,159
why not give it to him?

128
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,959
I'll buy you an even more expensive one.

129
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,879
A million yuan?

130
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,479
If it weren't broken before,

131
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,119
it might be worth that much.

132
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,720
But if it's broken and repaired,

133
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,600
it won't cost that much.

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,480
Broken?

135
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,999
Repaired?

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,799
If you don't believe me,

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,160
maybe you can try breaking it apart.

138
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,560
Impossible!

139
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,719
How dare the jade shop owner cheat me!

140
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,200
I'll settle this with him.

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
Jiaqi,

142
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,360
it seems like you've been duped.

143
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,840
Oh, Ying,

144
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,679
I arranged a dinner

145
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,479
with Mr. Zhang from Jiangnan Group

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,359
for you tonight

147
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,600
at your hotel.

148
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,039
Thanks,

149
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
but I don't need it.

150
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,279
Ying,

151
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,639
you've been trying to meet
Mr. Zhang for a long time.

152
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,280
This is such a great opportunity.
Don't be foolish.

153
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,399
Yeah, Ying.

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
If we can't get investment
for our hotel,

155
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm afraid that we won't last long.

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,080
Please spend your time discussing
with Mr. Zhang nicely tonight.

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
But I...

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Fine.

159
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,160
I'll accompany you myself.

160
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,079
See?

161
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,720
I can assist Ying in her career.

162
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,959
And you

163
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,880
can only guard doors for her.

164
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,479
Ying,

165
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,280
have a toast to Mr. Zhang.

166
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,920
Mr. Zhang,

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,119
I don't drink.

168
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,239
Please allow me

169
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
to toast with tea instead.

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,319
Ms. Xu invited me with so much effort,

171
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,280
but I don't feel your sincerity.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Mr. Zhang, you've given us the honor.

173
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,720
How could Ying not be sincere?

174
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Mr. Zhang, this toast...

175
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,839
Let Ying toast

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,440
as an apology to you

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Mr. Zhang, let me toast you.

178
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,679
I hope you'll give
Wanlong Hotel a chance.

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,119
Exactly.

180
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,999
We're relying

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,920
on Mr. Zhang this time.

182
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,040
Mr. Zhang, let me propose
another toast to you.

183
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,520
I've looked into your Wanlong Hotel.

184
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,399
It would be risky for us, Jiangnan Group

185
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,239
to invest in you now.

186
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,160
Let's not waste each other's time.

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,760
Mr. Zhang!

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,559
All investments carry risk.

189
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,039
I'm just hoping

190
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,200
you'll give us an opportunity
for an evaluation.

191
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
Hurry up.

192
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,680
Take it.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,320
Mr. Zhang, I'll finish this.

194
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
Ying!

195
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,919
Well, get yourself ready
and we'll come to inspect your hotel.

196
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,480
Ying, are you okay?

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,920
Oh...

198
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
Jiaqi.

199
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,760
Jiaqi,

200
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,080
I'll leave her to you.

201
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,839
Auntie,

202
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
don't worry.

203
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,359
Let go of me.

204
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
Let go?

205
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,760
Let go of me.

206
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
It's so warm.

207
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
Xu Meiying.

208
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,040
