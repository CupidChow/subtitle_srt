=Episode 15=

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,520
Mr. Yue.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,160
You've had a shock.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,080
This is a calming sleep-aid medication.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,280
Take it,
and you'll be able to get a good rest.

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,360
I won't disturb you further.

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,400
Have a good rest.

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
(Chen Yue.)

10
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,160
(You want me to become you.)

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,800
(Then, I'll use your identity)

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,720
(to defeat you.)

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,840
Mr. Yue.

14
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Chen Zhuo had
a complete breakdown last night.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,640
Oh.

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
I think if I push him a little more,

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,080
he'll go completely insane in no time!

18
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Shouldn't we applaud at this moment?

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Oh, right.

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Madness is good.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,440
If he goes mad, I can become Chen Zhuo.

22
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Then

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,320
Xu Meiying will be mine.

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,280
Mr. Yue,

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
you're a real mastermind!

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,440
Why does Zhuo seem like
a completely different person?

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,800
Hey.

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
I didn't order takeout.

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,640
Hey!

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,720
What's with that guy?

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,960
Beef and rice.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
Protect Meiying

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,120
for the next 24 hours.

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,840
Only Zhuo knows
that I like beef and rice.

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,440
Is that guy...

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,480
Meiying.

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Meiying, what's wrong?

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,280
Someone left this prank box.

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,560
Goodness!

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
This is clearly a threat!

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,920
Meiying,

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
this place you're living in
isn't safe anymore.

43
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,520
Come back to the hotel with me.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,760
I'll protect you 24 hours a day.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,200
Okay.

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Dao.

47
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,160
Yes?

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,200
You can go rest now.

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm safe here in the hotel.

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,720
It's fine, Meiying.

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't worry about me.

52
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,160
(Why is Dao acting so strangely today?)

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,320
(Does he also suspect the man with me)

54
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,240
(isn't the real Chen Zhuo?)

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,280
Could it be him?

56
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Xu Meiying,

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,360
marry me.

58
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Chen Zhuo.

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Did you call me over

60
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
just to watch you propose?

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,160
No matter what,

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
you're my brother.

63
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,080
I want you to be here to witness

64
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
the happiest moment of my life.

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,280
Xu Meiying.

66
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,440
(If he's the real Chen Zhuo,)

67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
(he'll stop me
from marrying this man in front of me.)

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,520
Okay.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
I'll marry you.

How dare you propose to another woman

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
when you already
have me as your fiancée.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Fiancée?

76
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,720
That's right.

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,040
He can only become

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,840
the true head of the Chen Family
if he marries me.

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,600
Why did you call me back

80
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
out of the blue?

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
Keep Chen Yue occupied

82
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,720
and away from Xu Meiying.

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,040
Frankly,

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
this will benefit you as well.

All right.

87
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,840
Sounds interesting.

Yin Muzi.

89
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,560
Why did you suddenly come back?

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Are you really planning
to marry this woman?

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,480
Yes.

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Xu Meiying is the only woman

93
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,840
I will ever love in this lifetime.

94
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,640
Wonderful.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,680
Since you love Xu Meiying so much,

96
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,440
that also means you're willing
to give up the position of family head.

97
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
Regarding that matter...

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,680

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,160
A word.

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,040
Ms. Xu.

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
I suggest you open your eyes.

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,600
Look carefully.

103

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
Wait.

Are you really Chen Zhuo?

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Don't move.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,320
Are you realizing

108
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
that I'm the one
who actually makes your heart race?

109
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
Answer my question first.

110
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,080
Yes.
