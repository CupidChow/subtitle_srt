00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,880
Ahh!

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,639
If you don't want to die, get lost!

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,759
You just wait!

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,040
You just wait!

7
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,120
Don't do anything crazy.

8
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,639
I'm a man,

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,880
not a saint.

10
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
Still hurt?

11
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,480
What do you think?

12
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
Are you sure there was
no prior close contact

13
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,880
between Xu Meiying and Chen Zhuo?

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,839
So, do you think I helped Chen Zhuo

15
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,159
become a hero

16
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,520
and win over Xu Meiying?

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,879
Make sure you arrange well for tomorrow.

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,040
I'll let him play hero properly.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:52,919
Hey.

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,440
Calm down.

21
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,380
(Wanlong Hotel)

22
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Why am I sleeping here?

23
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
Why am I...

24
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,160
You're awake?

25
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
Pervert!

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,040
What did you do to me last night?

27
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,399
It should be you

28
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,799
who did something to me.

29
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
I...

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,400
Ms. Xu, I'm here
to deliver your clothes.

31
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
My clothes?

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,399
You drank too much last night,
and your clothes got spilled with wine.

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,959
Worrying that you might catch a cold,
so Zhuo asked me to help you change them,

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,240
and bring you a new set
of clothes this morning.

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,240
Oh, okay.

36
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
Just leave them there.

37
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,960
What are you doing?

38
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,880
Changing clothes.

39
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,240
Sorry, I misunderstood you.

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,479
Hurry and get dressed.

41
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
It's work time.

42
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,160
Ms. Xu.

43
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
Uh...

44
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,759
Let's pretend nothing
happened last night.

45
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,880
Nothing happened.

46
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
Unless

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,720
you were hoping for something?

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,999
This is the company.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
You better keep your distance from me.

50
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
Yes. Ms. Xu.

51
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,000
What an exhausting night!

52
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,479
It's much tired than
working the night shift.

53
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,320
You were tormenting me!

54
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
Ms. Xu!

55
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,400
Someone is causing trouble at our hotel.

56
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,799
Trouble?

57
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
What happened?

58
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Someone says they had breakfast
in our restaurant and got food poisoning.

59
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:01,620
=The Best Man=

60
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,959
What's going on here?

61
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,400
My stomach...

62
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,080
Ahh...

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,159
What are you doing?

64
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
What's going on?

65
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,999
Are you the owner?

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,039
My brother got food poisoning
after eating here.

67
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,320
You have to compensate us!
Not much, just 300,000 yuan.

68
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,479
Otherwise, I'll expose your hotel.

69
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,880
My brother's a big influencer!

70
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,959
This is extortion and blackmail!

71
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,040
If you keep this up,
I'll call the police immediately!

72
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,639
Dang it!

73
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,239
You dare to call the police?
Buddies, smash this place!

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,039
Hey!

75
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,439
Stop it!

76
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
Don't smash! Stop it!

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,440
Everyone back off!

78
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,200
Ahhh!

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
Ahhh!

80
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,480
Ahhh!

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,479
Ahhh!

82
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,360
How dare you hit my buddies!

83
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
Huh?

84
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,679
Brother, why are you here?

85
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,919
Why are you here?

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,280
Sorry.

87
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Brother.

88
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
(Who exactly is Chen Zhuo?)

89
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
Ms. Xu! Mr. Zhang from Jiangnan Group
has arrived with the evaluation team.

90
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
They went straight to the restaurant.

91
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,679
I'm worried that he has heard something.

92
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,560
Don't panic. I'll go personally
to handle this.

93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,719
By the way,

94
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000
look into Chen Zhuo's
background in detail for me.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
Alright.

96
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,039
Dao.

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,599
Yes, brother!

98
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,079
Hurry up and find my bracelet.

99
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,839
Got it. You two search over there.

100
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,519
Hurry up. I'll check this side.

101
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,919
Mr. Zhang, I apologize.

102
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,519
There was an incident here this morning.

103
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
I heard there was a guest
complained about food poisoning.

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,639
It was a misunderstanding.

105
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,359
We've already resolved it.

106
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,680
Mr. Zhang,

107
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,479
what's so interesting
about the restaurant?

108
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,319
You should check out our hotel rooms.

109
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,279
I promise they're
beyond five-star standards.

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,200
The restaurant is the most
important part of evaluating a hotel.

111
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,759
Do you even understand
why your hotel is losing money?

112
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,520
There are many reasons for losses.

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,599
Poor market positioning,
weak service awareness,

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,359
overly simple marketing channels.

115
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Chen Zhuo! Shut your mouth!
Stop pretending you know everything!

116
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,239
Mr. Zhang, he's just
a security guard at our hotel.

117
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,079
He's talking nonsense.

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,760
Mrs. Xu, it seems even your grassroots employees
understand the hotel better than you do.

119
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,679
Brother!

120
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,160
Your bracelet was found!

121
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,279
Mr. Chen...

122
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,919
This is...

123
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,960
Mr. Zhang.

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,440
This is just a little gift from a friend.
It's not about the value, but the sentiment.

125
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,799
Chen Zhuo,

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,559
I hired you to guard the hotel,

127
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,239
not to let these gangsters in.

128
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,919
Get out of here!

129
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,079
Don't make a mess here.

130
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,879
I tell you,

131
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,079
if you ruin this evaluation,

132
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,279
I'll make sure you pay for it.

133
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,320
Mrs. Xu,

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,639
if it weren't for Mr. Chen,

135
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,519
I wouldn't even see
the need for this evaluation.

136
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,040
Hey, Mr. Zhang, wait...
