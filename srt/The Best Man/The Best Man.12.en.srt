3
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Meiying.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Meiying.

5
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,840
I can't take advantage of you

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,160
while my head isn't clear.

7
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm going to take a shower.

8
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,660
(Wanlong Hotel)

9
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,480
(Why can't I see clearly?)

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,400
I've already poisoned Chen Zhuo
and blinded him, just as you requested.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
When are you going to clear my name?

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,800
What's this?

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,080
You have two days

14
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,120
to make Xu Meiying take this.

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,080
Once it's done,

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,280
our boss will not only clear your name

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
but also help you reclaim everything
that belongs to you.

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Really?

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,440
Why should I trust you?

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,040
We share a same goal.

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,840
Who…

22
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,720
Who are you?

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,920
What's wrong that doctor?

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
You can't see,

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
yet they can't figure out the cause.

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
It's probably nothing serious.

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,360
It's probably just temporary.

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,920
It should get better in a while.

29
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,400
Still, we can't take it lightly.

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,600
We'll go to another hospital
for a second opinion tomorrow.

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Okay.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,000
Mm…

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Meiying.

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Meiying?

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,000
Meiying!

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Ying.

37
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
I've given you my heart,

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,000
yet you fell
for that pathetic security guard.

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,920
How foolish of you.

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
What are you doing?

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,120
That felt great.

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,840
What do you want?

43
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,160
Nothing.

44
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,880
What are you doing?

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,800
Nothing at all.

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,960
Take this!

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,040
Take it!

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,480
Swallow!

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
So you were pretending to be blind!

50
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
How else would you have shown yourself?

51
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,640
Now talk.

52
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,760
What did you give her?

53
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,840
How would I know?

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm not the only one

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,760
who wants you dead.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Lin Jiaqi!

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
Who's really behind this?

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,840
Funny enough, it's someone
who's quite connected to you.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,720
He specifically asked
for your eyes to be blinded.

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,360
(Someone who wants me blind.
Could it be him?)

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Are you okay?

62
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm fine.

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,240
I'll never let you
take this kind of risk again.

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
What would I do

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,400
if something happened to you?

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm fine now, aren't I?

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
If we don't take this opportunity

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,400
to expose the mastermind,

70
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,720
we'll have to live

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,480
in constant fear.

72
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,200
Lin Jiaqi escaped.

73
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
But don't worry.

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,760
I gathered some evidence.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,440
I wonder why he wanted me
to take that drug?

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,960
Would it do something to me?

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm not sure

78
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,800
what the drug does exactly,

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
but don't worry.

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll find out

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,480
who the mastermind is.

82
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
Zhuo.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
How's the investigation going?

84
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Oh.

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
The results are out.

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,647
(Brain Examination Report)
The doctor said

87
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:15,280
(Brain Examination Report)
the drug is designed to alter memory.

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
It's still in the experimental stage

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,000
and hasn't been released on the market.

90
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,000
It's very hard to obtain.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,480
It affects memory?

92
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes.

93
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Does this mean that her amnesia
wasn't caused by trauma

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,360
but was intentional?

95
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Where's Meiying?

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,040
She just left from over there.

97
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,840
Ying.

98
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,520
Why are you here?

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,560
I found out about that drug.

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,960
It's a memory-altering drug.

101
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Memory?

102
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,360
Could my memory really
have been tampered with?

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,120
No wonder I saw that man…

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,880
What did you see?

105
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,200
Have your memories returned?

106
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Yes.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
A little bit.

108
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,800
I didn't know how to tell you.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,760
Did you see the face of the person
who killed my mother?

110
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
- Yes.
- What did he look like?

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,320
His face

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,800
looks a lot like yours.

113
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
But I know it wasn't you

114
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,800
because you'd never do such a thing.

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
So it really was him.

116
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,280
Who?

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
I have a twin brother

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,800
named Chen Yue.

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
A twin brother?

120
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
Do you two look exactly alike?

121
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
Yes.

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Almost identical in appearance,

123
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,600
but our personalities are different.

124
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,400
I have a birthmark on my waist,
and he doesn't.

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
Chen Yue?

126
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Are you part of the Chen family
in Panlong City?

127
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,360
Xu Meiying,

128
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,720
listen to me.

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,680
I need to find him and get to the truth

130
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
about my mother's death.

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I'll wait for you to come back.

132
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Can you tell me
why you targeted Xu Meiying?

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,000
She saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,880
Zhuo,

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,640
is this the only reason you're here?

136
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,520
Fine.

137
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Let me ask you this.

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
Did you kill Mom?

139
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,960
Does it matter what I say?

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,480
Would you believe me?

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Yue,

142
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,840
I'll ask you one last time.

143
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Did you kill our mother?

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,880
I didn't kill her.

145
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,320
I just gave her

146
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,960
a little push.

147
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,520
She fell by herself.

148
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,440
Chen Yue!

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,800
