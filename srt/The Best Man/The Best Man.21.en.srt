3
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,320
Zhuo,

4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,279
haven't you had enough fun outside?

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,279
It's time to settle down and come home.

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,480
Grandma,

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,719
why are you here?

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,239
With such a serious incident happened,

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,639
how could I not come?

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
Your brother has ended up like that.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,799
Although it's his own fault,

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,919
he's still a descendant
of the Chen Family.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,360
Grandma, I know.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
Honestly, I never wanted
to compete with my brother.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,160
But what I never expected

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,320
was that he took a life away.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,599
I understand.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,199
He has always been
ruthless in his actions.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,759
So,

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,040
I never dared to pass
the patriarch's position to him.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
Zhuo,

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,559
you're now the last hope
of the Chen Family.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,999
You must return home immediately

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,679
to inherit the position of the patriarch

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,159
and marry Muzi right away.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,119
I can inherit the patriarch position,

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,399
but I want to let you know

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,959
that I will only marry Xu Meiying,

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,239
not the others.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
Shut up!

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,399
All these years,

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,239
you've been wandering outside

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,440
and becoming more unruly.

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,079
The Yin Family

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,439
saved our

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,559
Chen Family's life.

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,239
When your dad was still alive,

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,599
he made a promise

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,159
that

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,559
no matter who inherits the patriarch,

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,399
Yin Muzi

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,920
must be the family matriarch.

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,359
Hold on.

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,239
Grandma, there are many ways
to repay a favor.

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
There's no need to sacrifice
our happiness for it.

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
Grandma.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,080
Zhuo,

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
I've wanted to marry you
ever since I was young.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,520
I know you love Xu Meiying,

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,320
and I don't mind
if you continue dating her

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,839
after marrying me.

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,399
This is ridiculous!

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,280
Say that to Chen Yue instead.

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,999
Why are you all standing there?

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,719
Tie him up and bring him back!

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Grandma Chen,

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,960
it seems you still
don't understand Chen Zhuo.

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,040
You have no right to interrupt here.

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,719
I'm his fiancee.

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,159
I know him well.

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,679
If he doesn't intend to do something,

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,600
it's useless even if you force him.

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,919
Grandma,

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,799
do you know why

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,479
Chen Zhuo would rather work
as a security guard at our Wanlong Hotel

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,599
than go back to inherit
the family business?

67
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Hmph.

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,679
I wonder

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
what's so special
about the little Wanlong Hotel

70
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,240
that makes my grandson
reluctant to leave.

71
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
Hmph.

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
Grandma is a stubborn person.

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,600
It's going to be a tough battle.

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm not afraid.

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,679
As long as you don't give up,

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,440
I won't either.

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll never let go.

78
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,940
(Wanlong Hotel)

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,919
Old Madam.

80
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,120
Old Madam.

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,440
Call your boss here.

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,479
Sure.

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
Please follow me.

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,640
This is just a small and ordinary hotel.

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,720
There's nothing impressive.

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
Maybe it's because of the people.

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Xu Meiying does have some
tricks up her sleeve.

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,039
A girl who raised
in such a low-class family

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
still dream of marrying
into the Chen Family.

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,839
I've seen plenty of such women

91
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,640
with such a desire
to achieve triumph swiftly.

92
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,839
Hello, I'm the general manager
of Wanlong Hotel, Xu Meiying.

93
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,560
How can I assist you?

94
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,719
Your hotel is very dirty.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,680
I can't stand staying here.

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,119
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,079
Could you tell me
specifically where it is dirty?

98
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,199
If it's an issue
with the hotel's hygiene,

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,440
we can arrange someone for testing.

100
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,919
This table is too dirty.

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,919
I don't trust others to test it.

102
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,400
You do it yourself.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
Sure.

104
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,400
Please allow me to test it for you.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,080
Grandma,

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,720
there's no dust at all.

107
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,360
I hope you enjoy your stay at our hotel.

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,600
You're a diligent child.

109
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,159
But

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,399
to become the matriarch
of our Chen Family,

111
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,279
you are

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
far from qualified.

113
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Grandma Chen,

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,279
when I met Chen Zhuo, I didn't even know
he was part of the Chen Family,

115
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,279
nor that he was the future patriarch.

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,879
I love him for who he is,

117
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,479
regardless of his family background.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,120
That was in the past.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,039
Now, he's destined to be
the patriarch of the Chen Family.

120
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,039
Our Chen Family
values promise above all.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,759
He has to inherit the position
of patriarch of the Chen Family

122
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,840
and marry Yin Muzi.

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,120
If you truly love him,

124
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,839
you should let go

125
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
and support him.

126
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,519
Sorry, Grandma.

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
I can't promise you that.

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,639
For me,

129
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,559
even Chen Zhuo is just a security guard,

130
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,159
he is priceless.

131
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,560
Since the two of you
have such deep affections,

132
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,239
I'm not unreasonable.

133
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,159
As long as you don't ask for a title,

134
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,919
I can allow you

135
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,479
to stay by his side.

136
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,399
Sorry.

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,880
I can't accept that.

138
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,440
I won't accept it either.

139
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Let me make it clear again.

140
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,440
I, Chen Zhuo will only love
Xu Meiying for my entire life.

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,600
If I can't marry her,

142
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
I'd rather give up

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,880
the position of patriarch.

144
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,320
You rebellious child!

145
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
Grandma, don't get upset.

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Sit down and take a rest.

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
Calm down.

Do you really want to

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,919
I'll handle Grandma

189
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,560
and make sure she doesn't trouble you.

190
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,760
Okay.

191
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,239
Mom.

192
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,719
Ying, come home quickly.

193
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,360
Something serious has happened.

194
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,599
What happened?

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
Mom!

196
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,240
- Something has happened at my home.
- I'll go with you.

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,199
What are you doing?

198
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Second Young Master,
Old Madam wants you to return.

199
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
I won't go back.

200
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
You all can leave.

201
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,639
You should go back with them.

202
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,360
Don't get too tense with Grandma.

203
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,600
What about you?

204
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,799
I will be at my home.

205
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,919
Nothing will happen to me.

206
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
Don't worry.

207
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,680
Alright.

208
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,120
Then, call me if anything happens.

209
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,120
I'm leaving.
