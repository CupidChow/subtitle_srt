=Episode 11=

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,520
Zhuo!

4
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,320
Stay away from me!

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,560
You really put on quite the show,

6
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,360
Huang Yuhuan.

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,700
(Relationship officially announced.)

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,440
Lin Jiaqi, what is the meaning of this?

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
The people you hired
failed to do the job!

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,680
How was I supposed to know
Chen Zhuo would pull a stunt like this?

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,360
We've been played by him.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,480
So what do we do now?

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
They just announced their relationship.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm the mistress now.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,760
We won't be able to separate them

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,760
unless we resort
to some "special" means.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,040
What other methods do you have?

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,840
As long as you cooperate with me,

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
we can both get

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,280
what we want.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,120
What are you talking about, Zhuo?

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,240
Humph.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Do you think putting on this whole act
will fool me?

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
Huang Yuhuan, have I ever told you

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,960
not to act so recklessly?

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,480
Recklessly?

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,920
If everything
that happened today was real,

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,880
I would still give up everything for you
without hesitation.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
Would Xu Meiying?

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
Would she give up that hotel for you?

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,160
It's easy for you to give up everything

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
because it was easy for you
to get everything in the first place.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,520
Do you even know how much effort
Xu Meiying has put

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,840
into Wanlong Hotel?

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Why should she give it up?

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,040
Even if she wanted to,

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,520
I wouldn't allow it.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
So,

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,720
no matter how hard I try,

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,720
I'll never measure up

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,120
to her, will I?

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
That's right.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Huang Yuhuan,

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,640
Huang Yuhuan,

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,760
you'll soon understand
that while it's easy

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,600
to gain everything,

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
it's even easier to lose everything.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
Lin Jiaqi!

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
What gives you the right
to kick me out of Jiangnan Group?

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,160
Sigh.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,560
Did you forget?

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
For your dear Zhuo,

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,520
you transferred all your shares to me.

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,600
I've got your signature right here.

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,360
That was just a ploy
between the two of us.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
It wasn't real at all.

58
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
Hahaha!

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,840
You're so naive and gullible.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
This is a black-and-white,
legally binding contract.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,440
And you're telling me it's not real?

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,720
You chose to give up
your position as the heiress

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,440
just for some lowly security guard.

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,040
You tricked me!

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,480
What are you trying to do?

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,280
Huh?

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Lin Jiaqi, how dare you push me!

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,880
Guards!

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Detain him!

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,560
Kick her out.

71
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,600
From now on,

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
she is not allowed
to set foot in Jiangnan Group.

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,560
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,680
Lin Jiaqi!

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
Lin Jiaqi!

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,800
Let go of me!

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
Starting today,

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,800
Jiangnan Group

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
is all mine!

80
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,960
Hahaha!

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,920
You already knew Lin Jiaqi
was deceiving Huang Yuhuan.

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Why didn't you stop her
from signing the contract?

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
Oh?

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
Even though she was trying
to steal your man,

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
you're still helping her?

86
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
Huang Yuhuan is no more
than a child to me.

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,960
Why would I bother
competing with a child?

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,120
Hmm.

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Someone with her personality

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,560
won't grow up
unless she goes through some hardship.

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Mm.

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,240
But

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Lin Jiaqi is an untrustworthy scoundrel.

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,000
If Jiangnan Group
does fall into his hands,

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
it'll spell endless trouble.

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,120
Zhuo!

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,680
Zhuo!

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Huang Yuhuan?

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,040
What's wrong?

100
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,640
Zhuo,

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,800
that scumbag Lin Jiaqi

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,240
tricked me…

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
That contract wasn't even…

104
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,280
Uh… Why don't we talk inside?

105
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,920
Here are some new clothes.

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
Change into them and get some rest.

107
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,640
Stop overthinking things.

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,120
Thank you.

109
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Don't worry.

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
I'll remember your kindness.

111
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
Once I get Jiangnan Group back,

112
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,280
I'll definitely invest in your hotel.

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,640
Well, I suppose I've made
a pretty good deal then.

114
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,680
Of course you have.

115
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
All right, I'm going to rest now.

116
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
You should go to bed too.

117
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
Okay.

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,920
Huang Yuhuan.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,840
Pour the tea.

120
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,920
What are you standing there for?

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,480
Do you still think
you're the heiress of Jiangnan Group?

122
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Mom.

123
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,240
Huang Yuhuan is a guest.

124
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
If you want tea, pour it yourself.

125
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,320
Xu Meiying.

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Jiangnan Group
has already changed hands.

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
Instead of cozying up to Lin Jiaqi,

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
you've brought this troublemaker home.

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Are you out of your mind?

130
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,840
- I…
- Hey.

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,520
Mrs. Xu,

132
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,880
you spend your days
sucking up to people.

133
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Doesn't your tongue hurt?

134
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,080
You…

135
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Oof!

136
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,360
You think you can hit me?

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
Let me tell you,

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,840
even without Jiangnan Group,

139
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm still richer than you.

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,400
Meiying!

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,040
She pushed me!

142
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,240
So what if I pushed you?

143
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,720
Does it hurt?

144
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,160
Then suck it up.

145
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,520
Mom, I'm sorry.

146
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,720
If you want tea, pour it yourself.

147
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,200
Shareholders,

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,840
I have just taken over

149
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,760
as the Chairman of Jiangnan Group.

150
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
I've prepared this banquet
to celebrate with you all.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
Lin Jiaqi,

152
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,880
did you assume the position
of Chairman of Jiangnan Group

153
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,040
with my approval?

154
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,440
Who do you think you are?
Do I need your approval?

155
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
Everyone.

156
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,140
(Will)

157
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,880
This is the will Mr. Huang left
before his passing.

158
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
It grants me veto power over
the Jiangnan Group board's decisions.

159
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,320
I've decided

160
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,760
that I do not approve of Lin Jiaqi
taking the Chairman position.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't believe it!

162
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
That will must be fake!

163
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,360
I can confirm

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
that the will is genuine and valid.

165
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
Fine.

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,160
Even if you have veto power,

167
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,600
I am still the largest shareholder
of Jiangnan Group.

168
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
I hold decision-making authority
for its operations.

169
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,200
Here's a recording.

170
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,560
What do you want in exchange
for releasing him?

171
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,320
Name your terms.

172
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,360
I'll agree to anything.

173
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,720
If you want to save him,

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,520
hand over
all your Jiangnan Group shares.

175
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,480
Okay, I'll do it.

176
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,680
Just let him go.

177
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
Lin Jiaqi.

178
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm suing you
for kidnapping and extortion.

179
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,160
That was just an act
between the two of us.

180
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,360
It wasn't real.

181
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,840
If it wasn't real,

182
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,760
then how did Huang Yuhuan's shares

183
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
actually end up in your hands?

184
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,680
That's because…

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Also,

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,120
during his time

187
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
as Chairman of Jiangnan Group,
Lin Jiaqi embezzled

188
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,280
100 million yuan

189
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,760
of company funds.

190
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,040
Here is the evidence.

191
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Lin Jiaqi, those who commit injustice
will bring about their own ruin.

192
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,880
I suggest you turn yourself in.

193
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
Hahaha!

194
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,120
I see what's going on.

195
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,600
You've all conspired against me.

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640
Don't move!

197
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Don't move!

198
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
Chen Zhuo.

199
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,400
Xu Meiying.

200
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,840
You've all plotted against me.

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,160
Just wait.

202
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
I'll be back!

203
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,800
There's no need to worry.

204
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,680
I've already reported him to the police.

205
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,160
Lin Jiaqi will not escape

206
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,080
the law's judgment.

207
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,160
- Mom.
- Oh!

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,920
Oh, you must've had a long day.

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,960
Come, come.
I've just made some nourishing soup.

210
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,320
I can do it myself.

211
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,800
Meiying has also had a hard day.

212
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,280
Let her drink it first.

213
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,800
No, no.

214
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
This bowl is specially made for you.

215
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,920
Meiying's bowl
is for beauty and skincare.

216
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,040
Drink it while it's hot.

217
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,640
Don't force yourself

218
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,560
if you don't want to drink it.

219
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,080
(Things will definitely work out
between the two of them tonight.)

220
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,040
Chen Zhuo!

221
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,320
What's wrong?

222
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
- I can't hold back…
- Drink some water.

223
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,000
There was something in that soup.

224
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Chen Zhuo?

225
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,080
Chen Zhuo!

226
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,160
You're burning up!

227
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,880
Chen Zhuo…

228
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,320
You…

229
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
Meiying, don't say anything.

230
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,280
There's something
I've always wanted to tell you.

231
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
Every day I've spent with you

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,360
has been so special.

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I…

234
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
