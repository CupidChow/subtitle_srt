3
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,120
What's wrong with you
these past few days?

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,399
You've been acting strange.

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,999
(Chen Zhuo is too dangerous.)

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,070
(I can't let him stay
by my side any longer.)

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,799
I'm fine.

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,160
Zhuo, Meiying, I'm here to pick you up
from the hospital.

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,199
Zhuo.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,350
I'll take care of that.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
Zhuo,

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,470
have they found the person
who hit your car yet?

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,759
The police are still looking,

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,159
but there aren't any leads.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,199
When I find that person,

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,639
I'm going to punch them!

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,070
I'm so mad!

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,039
How is Jiangnan Group doing lately?

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,400
You were right.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,479
The surveillance footage in the study
was tampered with.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,630
The footage of the Chairman's death
has already been manually deleted.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,879
Looks like Huang didn't die
of an illness.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,119
It was murder.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,599
Dao.

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,679
Let me ask you.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,910
What do you think Huang found out?

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,799
I don't know.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,590
There weren't any USB drives
or anything of the sort at the scene.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,910
Do you think the culprit took them?

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,350
Xu Meiying,

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,950
what's the matter?

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,750
Chen Zhuo.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,350
I'm officially telling you

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,839
we're over.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,990
Over?

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,839
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,630
Get out of my house now!

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm not leaving.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,399
I want to stay by your side.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,070
Why stay by my side?

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,230
Are you waiting for me
to recover my memory?

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,919
What if I never recover?

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,079
Will you wait forever?

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,230
Yes.

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,519
I'm willing to wait.

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,710
There's no need.

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,710
I need you to leave immediately.

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,559
(Love Contract)

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,830
Our agreement ends here.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,319
Xu Meiying,

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,599
am I just a tool to you?

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,879
Something to use and discard?

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,679
Yes.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,079
I'm just a businesswoman.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,270
I only care about what benefits me.
What's wrong with that?

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,150
Meiying.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,079
What's gotten into you?

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,110
If something's bothering you,

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,550
you can tell me.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,390
And what about you?

61
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,230
Are you hiding anything from me?

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,870

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,670

I promise

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,310

Ms. Xu,

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,319
they're saying
that the hotel's cash flow has dried up,

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,559
and we won't even
get our salaries this month.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,990
The rumors you've heard are false.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,799
I promise everyone

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,479
that this month's salaries
will be paid in full.

89
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,119
Then prove it by paying us right now!

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,319
Yes! Pay us now!

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,239
- Pay us!
- Pay us!

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,079
Give us our money!

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,030
- Pay us!
- Pay us!

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,519

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,470
Can everyone hear me out?

98
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,839
Salaries will be paid on time,

99
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,830
and

100
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,079
Wanlong Hotel will not go bankrupt.

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,159
Why should we trust you?

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,910
You're just a security guard.

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,910
You're funny.

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,439
Who sent you here?

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,439
Nonsense!
I'm doing this for everyone's benefit.

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,479
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

107
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,810
This month's salaries will be paid.

108
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,790
But if anyone causes trouble,
they'll lose their attendance bonus.

109
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,390
He doesn't have the authority
to deduct anyone's pay.

110
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,510
However,

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,559
if anyone wants to resign,

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,790
I'll settle their full salary today.

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,119
Fine.

114
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,510
All right.

115
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,230
I just want to help you.

116
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,959
The hotel has a clear financial system.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,310
I don't need your help.

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,840
About the hotel's financial issues...

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
I can help you solve the problem.

120
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,359
Meiying,

121
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,039
I can invest in your hotel.

122
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,159
But only

123
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,870
if you give Zhuo to me.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,359
Chen Zhuo isn't my personal possession.

125
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,999
If you want him, take him.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,679
Well...

127
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,199
You're not lying to me, are you?

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,959
And you're not lying
about investing in the hotel, right?

129
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,879
Of course not.

130
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,030
Ms. Xu,

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,670
a security guard

132
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,830
is worth so little to you, huh?

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,319
Zhuo, once we're together,

134
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,400
you won't have to work
as a security guard anymore.

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,959
The entire Jiangnan Group will be yours.

136
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,110
Oh?

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,559
Such a generous offer.

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,879
Of course.
I can give you anything you want.

139
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,030
Sorry.

140
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,399
I have other matters to attend to.

141
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,710
Enjoy yourselves.

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,990
Zhuo.

143
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,190
Yuhuan.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,110
I don't want

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,639
to inherit Jiangnan Group.

146
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,599
I just want to be
a simple security guard here.

147
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,599
But you promised Grandpa
you'd take care of me.

148
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,319
Yes.

149
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,719
I promised your grandfather

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,959
I'd take care of you,

151
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,990
but

152
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,390
only as family.

153
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,190
If we're married,
that makes us family too.

154
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,239
It's so late,

155
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,830
and Chen Zhuo still isn't back.

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,550
Has he really gotten together
with Huang Yuhuan?

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,590
Were you waiting for me?

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,070
I wasn't.

159
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,430
I just want to remind you not to forget

160
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,630
that you're still my fiancé in name.

161
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,310
From your tone,

162
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,790
are you jealous?

163
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
I don't get jealous over men.

164
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,470
That's good.

165
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,479
I

166
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,479
just got carried away talking with Huan

167
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,839
and lost track of time.

168
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,710
I thought you'd mind.

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,399
I don't mind.

170
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,470
We're just in a contractual relationship.
Why would I care?

171
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,710
You really don't care?

172
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,830
Go take a shower.

173
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,710
Wash off the smell
of another woman's perfume.

174
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,510
I don't care at all.

175
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,550
What does it have to do with me?

176
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,750
Mrs. Xu.

177
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,910
Ms. Huang, have some tea.

178
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,910
Mrs. Xu,

179
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,519
as long as you let me be with Chen Zhuo,

180
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,550
the Jiangnan Group will invest
in Wanlong Hotel.

181
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,439
Do you understand?

182
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,479
Don't worry, Ms. Huang.

183
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,079
You have my full support.

184
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,270
Huang Yuhuan?

185
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,399
Why are you in my house?

186
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,550
