=Episode 24=

3
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,850
(I don't believe Chen Zhuo is
marrying Yin Muzi.)

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,710
(He must have his reasons.)

5
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,390
Zhuo.

6
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,519
Grandma's mourning period
isn't over yet.

7
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,479
Don't you think this is not appropriate?

8
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,030
Why did you ask me
to pretend to be Chen Zhuo

9
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,550
and date you?

10
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,359
Yue.

11
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,510
You pretended to be in a coma for long.

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,710
Haven't you missed me?

13
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,750
Do you think I will buy into this?

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,839
Chen Zhuo and Xu Meiying are
so lovey-dovey.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,710
The sight of it makes me want to

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,230
destroy Xu Meiying.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,270
As expected of the patriarch's wife.

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,590
You and I are really
a match made in heaven.

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,319
Well, it's also time for me

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,190
to settle the score with Chen Zhuo.

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,390
From today onward,

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,670
Chen Zhuo, the Chen Family's
11th generation grandson,

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,959
official takes over

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,110
as patriarch of the Chen Family.

25
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,350
Please accept the blade.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,599
Chen Yue!

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,319
Chen Zhuo!

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,359
Zhuo!

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,639
Put your hand down.

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,270
Show me some respect.

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,870
Okay!

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,230
Chen Zhuo.

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,310
If you dare take over as the patriarch,

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,390
both of them

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,319
will meet their demise.

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,350
Chen Yue...

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,870
Let them go

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,350
and you can be the patriarch.

39
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,039
How ridiculous of you.

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,150
Do you think all I want is
to be the patriarch?

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,510
I'm also after
those hateful eyes of yours.

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,110
How about this?

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,550
An eye for a lady.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,910
Who do you go with?

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,710
Both.

46
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,359
No, Chen Zhuo!

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,630
- Zhuo!
- Why not?

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,550
Well, stop screaming already!

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,559
Gosh, I really envy you.

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,590
Why are these women

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,399
doing things for you?

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,230
Huh?

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,159
Also,

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,159
since young,

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,359
you've had everything you wanted

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,910
without working hard.

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,150
You are a mere loser
through and through.

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,759
You are truly pathetic.

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,310
Pathetic, my foot!

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,990
Just look at me.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,070
Yes.

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,039
I've gotten everything I wanted.

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,590
And you?

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,910
You can't even protect your sweetheart.

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,030
What are you waiting for?

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,630
You have three seconds.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,070
Three.

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,630
Two.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,599
One!

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,350
Stop it!

71
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,070
No...

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,750
Zhuo!

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,830
No...

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,870
How dare you betray me?

75
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,430
Meiying.

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,670
Chen Yue.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,559
Ever since I was violated by you

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,270
on my 18th birthday,

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,270
I've meant to take revenge on you.

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,670
Did you know?

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,279
I felt utterly disgusted

82
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,430
by all the physical contact we had
after that!

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,639
I know Chen Yue has come around.

84
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,070
We can join hands.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,710
Why should I work with you?

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,990
I looked into what happened then.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,750
I found out he forced himself upon you.

88
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,070
What's your plan?

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,590
Chen Yue is a sinister and cunning man.

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,559
To protect Meiying,

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,070
I will pretend to break up with her.

92
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,990
You will then lure Chen Yue out.

93
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,110
On the day of me taking over
as patriarch we will see how it goes.

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,070
I've claimed
all of your criminal evidence

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,550
and called the police.

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,030
You will be locked up in jail forever!

97
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,630
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,990
I didn't mean to hurt you.

99
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,470
I know

100
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,190
you were trying to protect me.

101
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,470
Everything is okay now.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,910
It's all over now.

103
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,799
(The eldest son of Chen Family in Panlong City
is brought for justice and is jailed)

104
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,239
(for kidnapping and murdering)

105
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,550
(after getting out of hospital.)

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,179
(The hard work of Chen Zhuo,
the new patriarch of Chen Family,)

107
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,479
(has enabled the family's business
achieve greater success)

108
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,190
(within three mere months.)

109
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,630
Say 'cheese'!

110
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,799

111
