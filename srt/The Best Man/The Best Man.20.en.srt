3
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,620
Why are you getting so worked up?

4
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,880
You're not gentle with me at all.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,240
Not gentle?

6
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,480
Then let me be gentler with you.

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,320
Chen Zhuo,

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,320
he's not even your opponent,
why do you bother?

9
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,479
I knew it long ago.

10
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,920
No need to keep pretending.

11
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,679
Don't you think

12
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,080
there's a better
understanding between us?

13
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't think so.

14
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,440
Why can't I reach Mr. Yue's phone?

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,360
Stop trying.

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,839
My phone is broken.

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
Oh.

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,880
I see.

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,880
Mr. Yue.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,519
Chen Si.

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,079
Yes?

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,359
Is there

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
something you're hiding from me?

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,399
Mr. Yue,

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,360
what do you mean by that?

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
What do I mean?

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,559
Chen Si, I know you too well.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,359
You're loyal to me superficially.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,559
But recently,

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,000
it seems that you have been
keeping something to yourself?

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,920
I...

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,880
What?

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,079
Mr. Yue.

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
Why are your eyes darting away?

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,799
You know the consequences
of betraying me,

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,080
especially if you've taken
something you shouldn't have.

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Mr. Yue,

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,879
I was just too scared.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,080
I copied a file while I was
handling the video earlier.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
But I swear I haven't betrayed you.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,959
You know my handling method well,

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,720
and also what I will do.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,120
Hand it over.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll hand it over.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
Mr. Yue.

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,800
How dare you challenge me?

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,040
Do you know who I am?

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
So, who are you?

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Who am I?

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,480
Who am I?

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,360
Who am I!

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,960
Go to hell!

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,799
Mom,

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,040
why are you here?

55
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
Chen Yue,

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,719
how dare you...

57
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,239
How dare you kill someone?

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,999
Mom,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,479
this has nothing to do with you.

60
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,999
Chen Si!

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,639
I'm coming.

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
Come clean this up.

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,640
Luckily, the patriarch of the
Chen Family wasn't passed to you.

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,960
Mom,

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,839
what's wrong with me?

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Why do you look down on me too?

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,919
Enough!

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,960
You've already committed a crime.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,639
Come with me and turn yourself in!

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
- I won't go!
- Come with me and turn yourself in!

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
Mr. Yue.

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,239
Someone is coming!

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,440
- What are you doing?
- Someone is coming! Let's leave here.

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,319
Hurry up.

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
Leave her alone.

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's go.

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,440
Mr. Yue.

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,359
Mr. Yue, I know I was wrong,

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,959
but I never betray you.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,280
Please forgive me this once!

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,599
You should have been
ruthless a long time ago!

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
Being merciful can't survive
in the Chen Family.

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Mr. Yue.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
If ruthlessness is the standard for
being the patriarch of the Chen Family,

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
then Chen Yue is
undoubtedly the top candidate.

86
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
But now,

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,280
he must pay the price for his crimes.

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Hello,

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,000
I'd like to report a crime.

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,679
Huang Yuhuan went to buy a new phone.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
And, it's so late now
that she hasn't come back yet.

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,959
Huan is playful.

93
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,480
You know that.

94
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,759
Lend me your phone.

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
I need to make a call.

96
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,080
It's out of battery.

97
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
Let's go out to buy a phone with me.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,479
Can't we wait until
I finish watching this movie?

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
No.

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,040
Get up.

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,080
Hey.

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,280
Let's go.

103
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,439
Are you okay?

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm fine.

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,200
Thanks goodness you came in time.

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,879
Wait, your memory is not erased?

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
How dare you deceive me!

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,320
Do you think everyone
can be manipulated by you?

109
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,920
(The one who loves you is Chen Zhuo.)

110
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,639
(His twin brother, Chen Yue,)

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,000
(has never appeared by your side.)

112
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
(And, this Chen Yue)

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,400
(is the murderer
who killed his own mother.)

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,480
(This time,)

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
(I won't forget you.)

116
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,040
What if we can't recognize
each other again one day?

117
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's make a secret sign.

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
If we make a cross sign,

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,759
it means

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,519
we still remember each other.

121
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,760
Okay?

122
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,839
Impossible.

123
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,119
The memory was
successfully erased before.

124
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,119
How could it fail this time?

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,599
You'll never understand

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,240
that the memory of loving
someone can't be erased.

127
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,279
Love can resist everything.

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
What a nonsense love!

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
I tell you,

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,159
I'm going to take back
everything that belongs to me.

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
You!

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
Chen Zhuo!

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,840
I've finally settled you!

134
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,760
Chen Zhuo!

135
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,640
Chen Zhuo!

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,239
I've finally settled you!

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
Chen Zhuo!

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,759
The patient is now
in a vegetative state.

139
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,679
When he would wake up remains unknown.

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,479
Perhaps

141
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,959
he may never wake up again.

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
As his family, you should
be mentally prepared.

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,840
For him,

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,080
perhaps this is the best ending.
