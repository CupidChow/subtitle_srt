3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,679
Here.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,439
Let's celebrate Meiying's successful
reclamation of Wanlong Hotel.

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,190
Cheers!

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,190
Why are you here again?

7
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,630
I'm Chen Zhuo's rightful fiancee.

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,959
Wherever he goes,

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,119
I will be there.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,599
Have you no shame?

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,239
You're well aware Zhuo fancies Meiying.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,919
Yet you're here pestering him
time after time.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,030
Indeed.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,270
I'm not as skilled as you.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,790
You were trying to save him back then.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,799
In the end,

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,750
you got yourself into deep water.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,510
You!

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,870
Don't you throw tantrum at me.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,319
I'm not buying into it.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,470
Enough.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,670
What is this?

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,030
Let go of me!

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,550
Please enjoy it.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,759
This is our new menu,

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,910
bamboo mushroom soup.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,759
Well,

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,990
why don't you taste it?

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,390
Xu Meiying.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,239
Don't you know

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,230
that Chen Zhuo can't
eat bamboo mushrooms?

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,070
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,470
Well...

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,039
He and I are childhood sweethearts
who grew up together.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,550
I'm the one who knows him the best.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,959
Xu Meiying,

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,319
you are

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,390
the other woman here.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,150
Why...

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,230
This is nice.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,390
One can change their eating habits.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,910
Yet love

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,630
remains the same.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,790
Ms. Yin.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,710
Indeed, I don't know Chen Zhuo
well enough.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,479
However, in the future,

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,750
I will get to know about him
more and more.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,630
It smells so good.

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,750
Do you want to have some?

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,630
Meiying.

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,230
Yin Muzi has been trying to seduce Zhuo.

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,190
Aren't you worried she will steal him?

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,350
I believe Chen Zhuo.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,190
I really envy your relationship.

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,079
But Yin Muzi was right

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,950
about this.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,919
My stubbornness has led me
to make a lot of mistakes.

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,070
Will you hate me because of that?

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,790
Well, I forgive you

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,590
because you are adorable.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,039
That's great.

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,079
Yet you looked the most attractive

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,310
when you were acting like a rich girl.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,999
Well, if that's the case,

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,870
does that mean I stand a chance
to win him back?

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,470
No way.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,839
Are you mad?

68
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,830
No, I was just kidding.

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,110
Hello?

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,470
What?

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,670
Grandma has passed away?

72
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,147
(Ancestral values live long)

73
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:26,450
(The spirit tablet
of Chen Family's ancestors)

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,390
Grandma.

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,150
Pardon me for being unfilial.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,839
I'm late.

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,670
I am going to read out Old Madam's will.

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,159
"I,

79
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,030
Chen Feng Mingzhu,

80
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,150
hereby pen my will today.

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,719
Chen Zhuo shall be the next patriarch
of Chen Family

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,119
(Will)
and lead all the businesses

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,990
of the family.

84
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,359
What gives?

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,110
Who does he think he is?

86
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,230
He's nothing but a rogue.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,559
- He doesn't deserve to be the patriarch!
-Right.

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,670
I dare you say that again!

89
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,830
Stop it!

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,870
I will show no mercy
to whoever tries to cause a scene

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,750
at Grandma's mourning hall.

92
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,439
Chen Zhuo.

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,639
I said, you don't deserve
to be the next patriarch.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,950
Don't you get it?

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,150
Listen here.

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,350
I am now the true patriarch
of Chen Family.

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,990
Any objection?

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,710
Scram!

99
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,630
Why did he go missing all of a sudden?

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,070
I have no idea.

101
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,710
Meiying!

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,070
Meiying.

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,399
I know where he is.

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,910
Something has happened.

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,950
What's happened?

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,239
Old Madam Chen has passed away.

107
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,110
So Boss is back in Panlong City.

108
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,479
Meiying.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,830
I think you should go now.

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,879
You haven't had anything today.

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,230
Have some soup.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,630
I don't feel like eating.

113
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,790
Chen Zhuo!

114
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,510
Grandma.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,270
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,830
I didn't expect us
to meet again this way.

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,870
You have nothing to do with Grandma.

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,750
Chen Zhuo.

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,630
I'm sorry

120
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,990
for my lateness.

121
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,830
Just leave.

122
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,110
I promised Grandma

123
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,830
that I would be the next patriarch.

124
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,830
Once the mourning period is over,

125
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,150
Muzi and I will get married.

126
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,390
From today onward,

127
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,910
it's over between us.

128
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,950
So stop bothering me.

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,750
