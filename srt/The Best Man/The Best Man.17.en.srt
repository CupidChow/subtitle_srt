3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,560
What are you doing?

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,560
I wanted to use the iPad,

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,160
but I forgot the password.

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,280
I know you remember it,

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
so I thought I'd give it a try.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,160
I see.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
You don't need
to spend time trying it.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,960
You could've just woken me up.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,760
There's no need to be so sneaky.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
I see.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,080
I didn't want to disturb you.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,000
Here you go.

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,680
Thank you.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,000
I guess

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,080
you missed me a lot.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,480
That's why you came up
with such a lame excuse to see me.

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm not.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm just in a hurry.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,520
In a hurry?

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
There's no rush.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
After all, you'll be mine

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,200
sooner or later.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,720
I won't disturb you anymore.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,120
I'll go use the iPad
to search for something.

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,480
(She wants to use the fingerprint
verification to confirm my identity.)

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,640
(How could I not be prepared for this?)

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Sir, here's your card.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,000
The room number is 888.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Thank you.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,240
Is he Chen Zhuo's twin brother?

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,000
He's so handsome.

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
Yeah,

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,600
they have the same face,

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
but the aura is completely different.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Why is he staying at our hotel?

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,640
(Is he Chen Yue)

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,480
(or Chen Zhuo?)

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Mr. Yue.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,480
Mr. Yue.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,280
I didn't expect Chen Zhuo
to be out of our control

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
and escape from us.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,080
Find out Chen Zhuo as soon as possible

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
and keep him away from Xu Meiying.

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,520
Mr. Yue,

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,800
he now firmly believes
that he's Chen Yue,

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,160
and

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
he doesn't play by the rules.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
It'll be very tough for us...

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,320
I don't want to hear your excuses.

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
Go and find him now.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,640
Go now!

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,000
Sometimes, destruction
is also a form of art, isn't it?

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
It seems...

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,640
Someone is about
to disappear from this world.

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,880
In this world,

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,920
the genuine beauty is unique.

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,680
If you wanted to be the only one,
you'd have acted long ago.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,240
Chen Yue,

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,560
you're not as bad as you think you are.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,600
That was in the past.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,400
Now that we've switched identities.

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,160
It's either me or him who exists.

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,360
Do you want to pretend to be Chen Zhuo

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
for the rest of your life?

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,280
Don't you find it interesting?

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,560
Honestly,

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
every day now

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,040
is more thrilling

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,720
than any day in the past 20 years.

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
How amazing!

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,240
Only a lunatic like you can match me.

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,560
Are you following me?

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
Have you changed your mind?

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Or did you realize
I'm a better fit for you?

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Yes,

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,160
no matter who you are,

80
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,440
I like any.

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,120
(If you have the birthmark
on your abdomen,)

82
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,720
(then it will prove
you're the real Chen Zhuo.)

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,560
Enough.

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm not interested in women

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
who throw themselves at me.

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,760
How would you know you're not interested

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,880
if you don't give it a try?

88
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
You're Chen Zhuo's woman.

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,160
That's the only reason
I look at you differently.

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,040
I didn't expect it'd be
this easy to obtain you.

91
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,920
How boring!

92
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Stop pretending.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I know

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
you're Chen Zhuo.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,280
Meiying,

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
you're doing my laundry this late?

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Your clothes were dirty,

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,120
so I washed them.

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,720
No need.

100
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,840
Washing them is tiring.

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll do it myself.

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
No worries.

103
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,480
I...

104
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
What's this?

105
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,560
This?

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
A game card.

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,640
Give it to me.

108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,360
Why are you so nervous about a card?

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,160
I told you,

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
it's just a game card.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
Give it to me.

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,960
Chen Zhuo,

113
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,280
what's wrong with you?

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
Didn't you hear me asking you

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,760
to give the game card back to me?

116
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,840
Why are you getting so mad?

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,480
Do I look like Chen Zhuo to you?

118
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm Chen Yue.

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm here.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Let's talk somewhere else.

121
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
Alright.

122
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Look.

123
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,280
I think

124
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
this is where

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,000
all his criminal evidence is stored.

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,040
You've committed a crime.

127
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,760
Come with me and turn yourself in.

128
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,400
What's wrong with me?

129
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,040
Come with me and turn yourself in.

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,000
Why do you look down on me too?

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,360
Come with me and turn yourself in.

132
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,400
I won't go.

133
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,640
I won't!

134
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,720
Ahh!

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
Chen Yue didn't kill your mom.

136
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,640
But if he didn't commit a crime,

137
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
why does my memory remind me

138
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
he tried to kill me to silence me?

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
What is he trying to cover up?

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,240
Look,

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
