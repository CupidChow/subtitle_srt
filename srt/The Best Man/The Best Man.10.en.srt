Let's go.

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,390
I need to take some pictures.

As you can see,

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,590
Xu Meiying and I are a thing.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,599
As for Ms. Huang,

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,599
she's merely the granddaughter
of my late friend.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,959
I've always seen her as a little sister.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,079
So I hope you all
don't get things wrong.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,879
Be rational.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,790
Oh, by the way,

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,079
thank you all for coming.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,550
Please clarify things for us.
Thank you.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,150
Why is it unlike what the rumor says?

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,350
- How did it end up this way?
- How peculiar.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,550
What exactly happened tonight?

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,110
Did you pretend to be drunk?

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,550
Boss.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,310
Our man who was sent to keep an eye
on Lin Jiaqi said

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,799
that he met up
with Huang Yuhuan for times

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,799
in order to hire those reporters
to fabricate your relationship with her.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,839
Great.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,670
What?

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,830
He's really doing me a favor here.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,670
We might as well go with the flow.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,679
So you made use of his scheme

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,030
to draw the line with Huang Yuhuan?

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,190
No.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,310
I did it for your sake.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,710
I want no one to defame you.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,319
Chen Zhuo...

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,470
Xu Meiying.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,950
The contract is no longer valid.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,390
Instead, we're now a couple
who love one another.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,599
Yet I...

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,750
Xu Meiying.

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,550
Don't worry.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,990
I will help you overcome all obstacles.

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,359
Trust me,

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,510
Meiying.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,550
I love you.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,719
Oh, right. Where's Huang Yuhuan?

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,399
I saw her

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,950
entering this room with you.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,230
What's the matter with her?

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,870
It's nothing. Let her take a nap.

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,399
That's not
how you treat a lady, Chen Zhuo.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,950
Well, I was trying
to preserve my dignity for your sake.

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,719
Zhuo.

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,439
How could you do this to me?

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,350
Huang Yuhuan.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,590
I did promise your grandfather
to look after you.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,710
But not in this manner.

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,990
Don't ever do that again.

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,430
You!

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,559
(Wanlong Hotel's security guard incident
has been an internet sensation.)

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
(It remains a hot topic
among the netizens.)

63
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,920
(Mr. Security Guard)
(It's boosted the local tourism industry,)

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,830
(attracting numerous tourists
to visit the hotel.)

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,439
All the negative news
were gone overnight?

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
Yes. There's a huge change in the way
the netizens perceive the incident.

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,880
They all compliment Chen Zhuo

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,760
for being a trivial security guard
in the name of love.

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,040
That he wasn't reluctant to say no
to joining Jiangnan Group.

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,470
Moreover, Wanlong Hotel is
now well-regarded.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,430
I wonder who's managed
to make all this happen.

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,070
Ms. Xu.

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,079
If the investment remains insufficient,

74
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,239
our hotel

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,510
wouldn't be able to make it
until next month.

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,030
Here's five million yuan.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,759
Pay our employees' salaries

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,870
and settle the debt with it.

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,550
Where did you get
this large sum of money, Ms. Xu?

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,990
Did you sell your house for real?

81
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,359
As long as it can
solve our hotel's crisis,

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,870
I believe I will get
a bigger house in the future.

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,550
Did you secretly sell the house?

84
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,430
We just stay out of it.

85
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,919
That's the only property
my late mom left behind.

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
I am authorized
to do what I want with it.

87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,639
Ha ha ha!

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,199
Did you hear what she just said?

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,679
I've treated you like my own
all this time.

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,719
Well, well.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,230
Now you're dividing the assets, huh?

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,959
Ying.

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,679
This is really your fault.

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,159
Why didn't you discuss with us
before selling the house?

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,310
Dad.

96
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,520
She actually sold the house
without telling them.

97
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,079
Can we do this at home?

98
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,199
How could we run the business

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,719
by causing a scene here?

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,239
Hand over the real estate certificate.

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,999
That house doesn't belong to you alone.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,750
It's a mere real estate certificate.

103
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,630
(House Ownership Certificate)
This is an uncalled-for commotion, no?

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,119
Meiying had a mortgage loan
with the real estate certificate.

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,279
And now I've bought it back.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,039
What?

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,959
Please stop putting her on the spot

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,230
over trivial matters like this.

109
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,510
Chen Zhuo.

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,839
I'm aware

111
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,159
you and Ms. Huang are a thing.

112
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,350
Rest assured.

113
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,630
I will not let Ying pester you again.

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,559
No, Xu Meiying and I are a thing here.

115
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,159
If she weren't going to pester me,

116
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,039
I'd have to pester her, then.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,559
After all, I'm a picky person.

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,230
If I were to live off a woman,

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,750
Xu Meiying would always
be my only option.

120
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,990
Chen Zhuo actually involved
the Chen Family's personal account

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,950
for the sake of that woman.

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,110
How interesting.

123
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,230
Mr. Yue.

124
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,159
Old Madam should know that
Chen Zhuo is here.

125
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,479
What should we do next?

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,039
Since he's no easy feat,

127
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,270
we will target those around him.

128
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,479
Well,

129
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,199
go tell Lin Jiaqi

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,190
that

131
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,830
I will help him

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,750
get what he's after.

133
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,030
It feels good to be protected by you.

134
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,030
Why?

135
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,510
Do you want me
to be your security guard forever?

136
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,279
Well,

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,070
can you be my husband too?

138
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,270
Sure.

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,430
But you will have to pay me forever.

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,519
I don't find that necessary.

141
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,830
You managed to reclaim the certificate
with a huge sum of money.

142
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,439
I'm sure you're
more than a security guard.

143
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,590
Well...

144
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,790
I spent all my money on that.

145
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,470
And I did so for your sake.

146
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,320
You will have to support me after this.

147
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,559
Sure,

148
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,910
I will.

149
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,190
However, you must tell me

150
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,350
who exactly you are.

151
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,070
I know nothing about your background.

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,790
What exactly are you hiding from me?

153
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,030
Let me answer this call first.

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,550
Hello?

155
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,479
I'm being tailed by someone, Zhuo.

156
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,719
I'm scared.

157
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,870
What?

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,710
It's been a while,

159
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,390
Chen Zhuo.

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,310
Lin Jiaqi?

161
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,190
You are truly a snake.

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,159
Did I ask for your opinion?

163
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,590
You stupid security guard.

164
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,430
You went all the way to catch me here

165
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,239
in order to vent your anger on me.

166
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,790
Ha ha ha!

167
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,350
Well,

168
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,470
that would be too merciful of me.

169
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,710
Lin Jiaqi! Let go of Zhuo!

170
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,950
Let go of him?

171
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,190
I won't let him off easy.

172
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,830
Lin Jiaqi...

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
What do I have to do
for you to release him?

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,510
I will do anything for you.

175
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,710
You're certainly a lucky security guard.

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,830
Ms. Huang is trying to save you here
at all costs.

177
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,350
You can save him

178
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,190
by giving me all of your shares
in Jiangnan Group.

179
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,479
Okay,

180
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,719
you have my word.

181
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,959
As long as you let him go.

182
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,599
Nice!

183
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,150
Ha ha ha!

184
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,630
Awesome, Huang Yuhuan!

185
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,719
What are you doing?

I know what I'm doing is reckless.

Stop being sentimental here.

Get away from me.

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,110
