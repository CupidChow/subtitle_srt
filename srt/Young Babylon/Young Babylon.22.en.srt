24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,870
Why is there only one screen working,

25
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,060
while the other three are black?

26
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,620
(No Signal)
Actually, there are cameras in these places,

27
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,520
but you know the situation in the factory now.

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,120
There aren't many workers in the factory,

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,160
and they don't have much money,

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
so

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,680
there's no money to repair them.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,980
It's okay. This one will do.

33
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,390
We can see the entrance to the cold storage.

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,820
Oh, right.

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,010
Someone just went in.

36
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,100
Let me replay it.

37
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,260
I've watched it so many times,

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,750
and I can recognize all the hundreds of

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,360
employees in our factory,

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
but I still

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,310
don't know who he is.

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,570
You two, take a closer look.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,380
See if you recognize him.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Who is it?

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,700
Lu Xiaolu?

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,220
How did you get in here?

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,010
I have a spare key
that I forgot to give you.

48
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,260
Now it's come in handy.

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
Look there.

50
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,730
The person who injured Master Niu

51
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,610
should be tall.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,910
How dare you hit my dad!

53
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
Open the door.

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,010
Open the door!

56
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,550
Let me try.

57
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,990
What's wrong?

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,450
It seems to be locked.

59
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,260
No signal here.

60
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,710
Let me check.

61
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,110
Do you have it over there?

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
No.

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,530
Look.

64
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,260
A footprint.

65
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,450
This is different

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,650
from the other footprints.

67
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,570
This is a tactical boot.

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,740
There are hardly any people
in the factory who wear these.

69
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,590
They're too bulky.

70
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,530
Usually it's those hooligans on the streets

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,970
who wear them.

72
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,700
There's even a crack in the middle.

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,620
These boots are really old,

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,060
probably left by the culprit.

75
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,820
You understand street matters better.

76
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,940
I'll take a picture first.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
Okay.

78
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,470
What are you doing?

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,010
Put this on,

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,890
don't get cold.

81
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,180
Have you ever thought about

82
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,740
what the person who injured Master Niu

83
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,300
was trying to achieve?

84
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,500
Master Niu has been opposing
the resumption of work.

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,180
So the person who injured him

86
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,550
is trying to threaten the workers

87
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,450
to resume work quickly.

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,970
If that's the case,

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,090
then I should be the prime suspect.

90
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,260
You are right.

91
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,860
But who's the second suspect?

92
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,330
Do you still suspect Huang Qing?

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,090
Isn't he worth suspecting?

94
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,740
I don't think it's him.

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,380
You trust him so much?

96
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,570
After I left school,

97
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,620
I had nowhere to go.

98
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,260
He took me in.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,740
At that time, I hadn't seriously
studied economics.

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,310
Wanting to make my mark

101
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,970
in the industry

102
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,380
was like dreaming.

103
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,500
He taught me,

104
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,590
guided me

105
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,770
through each project,

106
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,060
that's how I got to where I am today.

107
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,470
If it weren't for him,

108
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,530
I would have given up long ago.

109
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,940
So,

110
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,530
he must be very important to you.

111
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah.

112
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,910
I understand.

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,380
I once had someone

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,450
whom I trusted unconditionally.

115
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,090
You should take it back.

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,640
I don't need it.

117
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,710
I can handle the cold.

118
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,150
It won't hurt me.

119
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,210
It might

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,450
hurt you instead.

121
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,330
If you freeze to death,

122
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,260
who will take care of this mess
of the factory?

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,970
No one should freeze.

124
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,890
Let's go out together.

125
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,040
We're both so lucky,

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,220
neither of us will freeze to death.

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,820
Bai Lan, Bai Lan, are you there?

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,820
- Bai Lan.
- Yes, I'm here.

129
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,620
- Be careful, be careful!
- Oh my god!

130
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
Xiaolu.

131
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,970
Who locked the door?

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,990
Xiaoying called and said Bai Lan is here,

133
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,180
she asked me to let her out.

134
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,820
- Xiaoying?
- I've scolded her thoroughly.

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,520
Alright.

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,820
Send her back quickly.

137
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,210
- Just go.
- You can take it back now.

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Let's go.

139
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,620
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

140
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,910
Feeling cold?

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,230
Put on your coat.

142
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,540
=Episode 22=
=A Bet on Tomorrow=

143
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,630
You've run enough?

144
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,160
Tired now?

145
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,230
I really can't understand,

146
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,910
you were locked in the cold storage
during the day,

147
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,260
and then come out at night
to run and sweat.

148
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,610
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
Here.

150
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Wear this.

151
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,310
I really don't understand.

152
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,390
What happened in the warehouse?

153
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,980
What did Bai Lan do to you?

154
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
Little Pouter told me that

155
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,810
you two have become close again.

156
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,500
Old feelings rekindled?

157
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,650
It's time to stop.

158
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,580
Stop what?

159
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,170
You know, I've never

160
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,010
been able to let her go
in these five years.

161
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,770
I've always regretted

162
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,580
leaving her like that.

163
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,650
But she's doing well now,

164
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,050
and she has someone to take care of her.

165
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,980
It's time to let go.

166
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,050
You two are really over?

167
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,870
Yeah,

168
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,810
it should have ended long ago.

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,590
Let's go!

170
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,440
Are you okay?

171
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,220
Lyu told me

172
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,700
you were trapped
in the cold storage today,

173
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,220
are you okay?

174
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,220
Nothing serious,

175
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,260
just caught a chill.

176
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
This can warm you up.

177
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,660
Thank you.

178
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,580
I needed this.

179
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,060
I heard Lu Xiaolu was there too.

180
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Did he cause you any trouble?

181
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,740
Not at all,

182
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,500
in fact, I'm glad he was there.

183
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,540
Otherwise, I wouldn't have managed alone.

184
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,340
He's your ex-boyfriend
from back then, right?

185
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,300
Yeah.

186
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,540
Looks like he still

187
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,900
has a significant impact on you.

188
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,500
No, not really.

189
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,060
I don't want him

190
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,820
to affect your judgment.

191
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,700
You seem tired lately.

192
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
Why don't you take a break?

193
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,140
I can't.

194
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,780
I want to finalize the cooperation

195
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,420
with the Italians as soon as possible,

196
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,180
turn around the situation in the factory,

197
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,500
and calm the workers' emotions.

198
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,740
That's the priority.

199
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,340
I've made up my mind.

200
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,380
Once Master Niu recovers,

201
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,300
I'll arrange for Mr. Mancini

202
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,620
to meet with the key people in the factory.

203
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,900
This will boost confidence on both sides.

204
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,420
Didn't you say Fucheng was beautiful?

205
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,220
I've been busy working since I arrived,

206
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,300
and had no time to explore.

207
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,940
Why don't you show me around tonight?

208
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,820
Alright.

209
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,780
You've been here before?

210
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,700
A long time ago.

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,940
Stop it, Dad will take you
to the amusement park.

212
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,340
Thank you.

213
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
I mean...

214
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,420
Doctor Bai?

215
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,700
When did you come back?

216
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,260
This is my wife.

217
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,020
She used to work at our food factory too.

218
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,500
Nice to meet you.

219
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,700
This is my son,

220
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,540
his name is Kaixin.

221
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,780
Come on, say hi to Auntie.

222
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,260
Hello, Auntie.

223
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,940
This is my boss.

224
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,660
This is

225
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,220
my old colleague from the food factory,

226
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
the office secretary,

227
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,340
Secretary Bi.

228
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,460
Bi Zhigang.

229
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,740
A colleague from the food factory, huh?

230
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,820
Yes.

231
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
You are surnamed Bi.

232
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,980
Is Vice Mayor Bi of Fucheng

233
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,340
related to you?

234
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,900
He's my father-in-law.

235
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,260
What a coincidence.

236
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,180
I met him yesterday.

237
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,020
Sorry,

238
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
I don't know him well.

239
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,660
Alright, come on, Kaixin,

240
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,060
say goodbye to Uncle and Auntie.

241
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,740
Dad will take you to the amusement park.

242
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,500
Goodbye.

243
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,740
Let's go.

244
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,940
Dad heard

245
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,980
there's a new toy at the amusement park,

246
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,540
and they have cotton candy too.

247
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,100
Do you want it?

248
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,300
After knowing you for so long,

249
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,340
it's the first time I've learned

250
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,860
you like horror movies.

251
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,820
I have many surprises.

252
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,540
(Lu Lan)

253
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,300
welcome to the New Century Grand Theatre.

255
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,940
I am Fucheng's famous prince of love songs,

256
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,860
Lu Xiaolu.

257
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,540
Today, I will dedicate my
premiere performance on this stage

258
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,500
to the beautiful lady in the audience,

259
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Bai Lan!

260
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,500
High above the silvery ocean,

261
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,020
winds are gathering the storm-clouds.

262
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,500
And between the clouds and ocean,

263
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,860
proudly

264
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,060
wheels the Stormy Petrel,

265
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,900
like a streak of sable lightning.

266
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,140
It's the storm!

267
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,140
The storm is breaking!

268
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,300
Still the valiant Stormy Petrel

269
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,780
proudly wheels among the lightning,

270
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,780
over the roaring, raging ocean.

271
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,940
And his cry resounds exultant, like a prophecy
of triumph--

272
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,900
Let it break

273
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,180
- in all its fury!
- In all its fury!

274
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,420
Bai Lan,

275
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,740
will you join me

276
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,100
as a lifelong member of this theater?

277
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,260
Let's watch movies together

278
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
and grow old together.

279
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,740
(Lu Lan)

280
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,900
(Director's Office)

281
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,740
Why?

282
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,220
My negotiation with Mancini
went pretty well,

283
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,500
why did he suddenly change his mind?

284
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,060
The food factory can't provide

285
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,860
the sales channels they're satisfied with.

286
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,500
They gave up.

287
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
That's impossible.

288
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,460
Even if we didn't have them before,

289
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,620
we can open new channels

290
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,420
in the South China region in the future.

291
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,060
Isn't there any room for negotiation?

292
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,580
I ultimately rejected them.

293
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,060
Cooperation should be fair,

294
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,500
but they kept adding conditions.

295
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,420
That's my bottom line.

296
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,620
Couldn't you
have consulted me beforehand?

297
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,460
If we don't cooperate with them,

298
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,320
what will the factory produce
after resuming work?

299
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,180
Then don't resume work for now.

300
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,020
We'll find another solution.

301
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,540
What solution?

302
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,300
The profits from production

303
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,940
are far less than

304
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,580
the profits from land appreciation
in Fucheng.

305
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,000
You want to buy land
for real estate development?

306
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,540
You want to lay off all the workers?

307
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,260
This wasn't a sudden decision for me.

308
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,260
In business, you can't put all eggs
in one basket.

309
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,420
Moreover, from a marketing perspective,

310
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,100
the profits from real estate development

311
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,300
are something you couldn't earn
selling chocolates for ten years.

312
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,380
Did you plan this a long time ago?

313
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,980
Don't look at me like that.

314
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,740
You willingly came to Fucheng
in the first place,

315
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,900
and out of self-interest,
I wanted to give you

316
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,700
a chance to develop.

317
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,580
That's why I didn't interfere with
your plan to acquire and

318
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,300
restructure the food factory.

319
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,220
But things are different now.

320
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,740
With Bi's help,

321
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,260
the land of the food factory

322
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,580
is a ripe piece of meat waiting to be eaten.

323
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,300
Seeing it but not seizing it

324
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,460
will be my incompetence.

325
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,780
If you had this plan all along,

326
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,020
why didn't you tell me beforehand?

327
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,660
You watched me trying to resume work,

328
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,180
negotiating with the Italians,

329
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,020
and being anxious every day,

330
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,740
were you just enjoying it?

331
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,300
Or did you never intend for me

332
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,140
to win from the start?

333
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,420
Of course not.

334
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,700
I swear,

335
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,840
if the Italians

336
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,610
had made concessions
at the negotiation table today,

337
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,140
I wouldn't have said a word of this to you.

338
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,700
I would fully support you, help you

339
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,660
get the factory back on track,

340
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,460
and stand by you when it officially

341
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,380
resumes production.

342
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,660
I would be there to celebrate with you.

343
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,140
But we have to face reality.

344
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,740
It's come to this,

345
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,260
with no room for compromise.

346
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,460
Mancini will leave Fucheng tomorrow

347
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,700
and never return.

348
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,780
This path

349
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,660
is closed.

350
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,260
Does that mean it's all over now?

351
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,860
Just a minor setback in life,

352
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,180
something you'll forget after

353
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,380
taking a vacation.

354
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,660
How about this?

355
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,020
Whether you go to Hong Kong

356
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
or back to Shanghai,

357
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,020
I'll clean up the mess here.

358
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,820
I won't give up easily.

359
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,420
They're leaving tomorrow,

360
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,820
so I still have time to convince them.

361
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,820
Even if it doesn't work out,

362
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,260
I can find other partners.

363
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,700
If I succeed in negotiating a deal...

364
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,060
If you succeed in doing that,

365
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,780
I'll give you an additional three months.

366
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,030
You can use that time
to restore the factory's profitability

367
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,580
and pay back the workers.

368
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,140
I have full faith in your abilities.

369
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,380
But why should I do this?

370
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,620
Before you came to Fucheng,

371
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,460
you said

372
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,980
if you couldn't complete the reform
of the food factory,

373
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,020
you'd be willing to stay by my side
for another ten years.

374
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,700
Remember that?

375
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,300
Then give me another month.

376
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,340
Five days.

377
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,780
No room for negotiation.

378
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
Five days it is.

379
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,280
(Good Cat Restaurant)
Eat and drink

380
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,330
to your heart's content today.

381
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,380
If you're feeling dissatisfied,

382
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,460
don't hold it in.

383
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,340
Let it out.

384
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,900
Sir,

385
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,420
bring a case of beer.

386
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
Coming.

387
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,700
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

388
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,100
- No problem.
- Thank you.

389
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,740
- Here.
- Here.

390
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,420
Xiaoying.

391
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,900
What are you doing?

392
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,340
We know you have been upset recently.

393
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,140
Just say whatever you want to say

394
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,540
and scold whoever you want to scold.

395
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
Don't hold it in.

396
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,860
Okay.

397
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,980
Then I'll speak first.

398
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,860
It's my fault to lock Bai Lan
in the cold storage.

399
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,620
I apologize to you.

400
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,700
- Come on.
- Bottoms up.

401
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,660
What...

402
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
- What are you doing?
- I'll drink it for you.

403
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,060
You can't drink too much.

404
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,140
Alright, go ahead.

405
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,220
Drink it up.

406
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,940
But,

407
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,380
it's fine to target me,

408
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,460
but definitely

409
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,300
not my dad!

410
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,700
He's not just your dad,

411
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,940
but also our master.

412
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,700
With us around, who dares to target him?

413
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,540
Don't worry.

414
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,620
We'll help our master get justice.

415
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,380
- Another one!
- Sure.

416
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,580
- Cheers.
- Come on.

417
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,420
Come on.

418
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,460
Cheers!

419
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,020
Xiaoying,

420
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,980
can we eat now?

421
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,500
Of course. Please.

422
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,820
You should eat a lot.

423
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,660
You've been working overtime these days,

424
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,060
I wonder what Bai Lan is thinking,

425
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,100
making you go through all this.

426
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,580
It's not about her.

427
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,780
It's because their negotiations
with the Italians fell apart.

428
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,340
The Italians wanted sales channels

429
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,540
they couldn't provide,

430
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,940
so they decided not to cooperate.

431
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,780
They'll be leaving tomorrow.

432
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,380
And then that Huang Qing

433
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,100
issued an ultimatum to Bai Lan.

434
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,700
If she can't convince

435
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,660
the Italians to stay,

436
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,180
she has five days

437
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,500
to find a new factory.

438
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,620
What if she can't find one?

439
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,820
Why are you looking at me?

440
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,900
Eat.

441
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,220
Let's eat.

442
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,340
Come on, have another drink.

443
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,340
- Why are you so quiet?
- Come on.

444
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,180
What's going on?

445
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,480
- Let's drink.
- We don't eat together a lot.

446
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,820
Cheers.

447
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,860
Come on, cheers.

448

(Good Cat Restaurant)

449
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,820
You knew you couldn't handle alcohol.

450
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,940
Why did you do that?

451
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,500
You gave him the gift,

452
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
but why didn't you show up?

453
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,740
How did you know it was me?

454
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,580
No, no,

455
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
it wasn't me.

456
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,060
Xiaoying,

457
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,700
can I ask you something?

458
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
Go ahead.

459
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,380
Do you still dislike me?

460
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
Yes.

461
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,900
I dislike people like you

462
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,980
who run away after being scolded.

463
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,580
My dad was injured in the head,

464
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,380
and you gave him books and chess.

465
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,300
Do you think his injuries
aren't serious enough?

466
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,620
When I gave the gift,

467
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,740
I didn't think that much.

468
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,300
I just thought he would be bored

469
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,060
in the hospital, so I...

470
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,620
Now he's not bored at all.

471
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,820
His hospital room is lively

472
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,140
with people playing chess with him.

473
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,580
He's suffering from headaches

474
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,060
and still asks about

475
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,900
the Battle of Guandu.

476
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,140
It annoyed me,

477
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,860
so I took away the books and chess.

478
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,500
Now he's mad at me.

479
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,380
That's good.

480
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,220
Go home.

481
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,540
Go home.

482
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,820
Go home.

483
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,060
Let's hold hands.

484
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,100
It's not worth it for a small matter.

485
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,980
Dr. Bai,

486
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,020
are you thinking of jumping again?

487
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,740
You rogue,

488
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,620
why are you here?

489
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,500
By the way,

490
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,900
I dreamt of you last night,

491
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,780
cursing you.

492
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,860
Why would you curse me

493
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,140
in your dream, female rogue?

494
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,540
Because you keep haunting me,

495
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,780
wanting to kill me.

496
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,500
Am I that bad in your dreams?

497
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,780
What do you think?

498
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,900
What is the matter?

499
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,140
I'm here to fulfill your wishes.

500
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,340
(Gongyuan)

501
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,140
Do you know what you were just
talking about?

502
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,020
Yes.

503
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,420
(Gongyuan)

504
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,540
Our company wants to exchange shares
with the food factory.

505
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,260
Any issues?

506
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,300
I don't agree.

507
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,820
In Fucheng's food industry,

508
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,500
our company's distribution channels

509
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,020
are among the best.

510
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,380
Just last month,

511
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,900
I coordinated with Hong Kong

512
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,460
and South China distributors.

513
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,300
So,

514
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,540
the channel issue
the Italians are concerned about

515
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
is not an issue.

516
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
What?

517
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,820
Is our company too small for you?

518
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,780
No, it's not that.

519
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
Then what is it?

520
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,820
The risk is too high.

521
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,500
- I know.
- You don't know.

522
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,300
Given the current situation
of the food factory,

523
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,260
even if this deal goes through,

524
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,300
I can't guarantee the future of the factory.

525
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,300
I understand that.

526
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,060
So even if you join,

527
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,820
it's not necessarily going to be profitable.

528
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,500
In fact, it could be a total failure.

529
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,820
I understand all that.

530
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Then why take this risk?

531
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,580
If you can take the risk,

532
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
why can't I?

533
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,420
I have nothing to lose.

534
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,580
Don't you understand that?

535
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,820
This path is the only hope
for the factory

536
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,300
and, for me, as well.

537
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,620
But it's different for you.

538
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,450
You have a good business and a good life.

539
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,740
Why give that up?

540
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,740
I can't let you wade through this mess.

541
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,580
So I can't let you

542
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,900
do me this favor.

543
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,500
Manager Bai,

544
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,540
I think you may have misunderstood.

545
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,420
Joining the food factory might help a little,

546
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,420
but it's mostly a business decision.

547
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,060
Our company has always focused
on distribution channels,

548
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,940
lacking independent production capabilities.

549
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,220
The food factory

550
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,340
is the opposite.

551
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,620
Isn't this a perfect match?

552
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,060
So,

553
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm not trying to help you.

554
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,420
I'm trying to hitch a ride on your success.

555
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,340
What?

556
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,780
Don't you believe you can succeed?

557
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,100
I can't guarantee the outcome.

558
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,980
But I believe in you.

559
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,220
I remember you said

560
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,180
this company isn't just yours.

561
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,540
Li Guangnan also has a stake.

562
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,060
Will he agree?

563
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,660
Don't worry.

564
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,580
When it comes to making big money,

565
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
he's more enthusiastic than me.

566
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,860
Let's go.

567
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,100
Call the Italians and tell them

568
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,260
we have a deal to discuss.

569
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:59,140
(Gongyuan)

570
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,380
This is all the money
our company currently has,

571
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,220
plus this office

572
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,820
and the warehouse in the suburbs.

573
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,100
Take it all.

574
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,140
What are you doing?

575
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm planning for the company
to exchange shares

576
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
with the food factory,

577
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,500
but I don't want to drag you all down
with me.

578
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,780
Lu Xiaolu, are you crazy?

579
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,540
What has Bai Lan been telling you

580
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,420
to make you keep giving in?

581
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,220
You gave up the cold storage,

582
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,220
okay.

583
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,540
But you are now giving up everything?

584
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,340
It's not as bad as you're thinking.

585
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,340
Just take the money.

586
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,580
Otherwise, if I end up losing,

587
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,300
how will you two live?

588
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,180
What about Master's retirement money?

589
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,940
Do you think if you lose,

590
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,980
we'll applaud

591
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,460
and be grateful?

592
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,100
I know,

593
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,580
you founded the company,

594
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
but what right do you have now

595
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,980
to talk about splitting up

596
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,820
and parting ways?

597
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,820
Compared to that woman,

598
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,140
what are we to you?

599
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,940
Li Guangnan, watch your tone.

600
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,140
It's not just for Bai Lan.

601
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,340
The factory also needs help.

602
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,820
What help does the factory need?

603
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,740
It's already collapsed beyond saving.

604
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,900
Lu Xiaolu, let me tell you,

605
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,700
we're in business,

606
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,300
not charity.

607
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,700
If a person is capable, they make money;

608
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,900
if not, they're poor.

609
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,780
You want to split up, right?

610
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,620
Since we're so

611
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,460
unimportant to you,

612
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,980
let's part ways.

613
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Xiaoying!

614
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,980
Lu Xiaolu,

615
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,580
I'll give you one last chance.

616
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,100
You must

617
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,340
choose between

618
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,300
us and Bai Lan today.

619
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,380
If you choose the food factory,

620
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,220
then we're done.

621
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,660
Fine.

622
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,020
Do you want to smoke?

623
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,380
How about a drink?

624
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
Forget it,

625
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,340
it's bad for my voice.

626
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,180
You're really persistent.

627
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,420
Now I finally understand

628
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,020
why we can be brothers.

629
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,100
It's all about being stubborn

630
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,980
and sticking to one path until the end.

631
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Like the connections

632
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,980
between you and Guangnan.

633
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,300
Xiaolu,

634
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,180
are you really willing to give up

635
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,140
everyone's effort for Bai Lan?

636
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Not entirely.

637
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,420
Then,

638
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,380
is it for the factory?

639
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,460
That's part of the reason.

640
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,380
Then why?

641
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,060
While Bai Lan
is gambling for her freedom,

642
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,540
Master and the workers

643
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,700
are gambling for compensation.

644
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,300
I'm also gambling,

645
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,740
but I can't drag you all into it.

646
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,700
Xiaolu,

647
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,380
don't worry.

648
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
I'll talk to Xiaoying.

649
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,020
(Gongyuan)

650
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,130
This is our company's

651
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,680
cooperation agreement
with the food factory.

652
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Please review it again.

653
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,020
If there are no issues,

654
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,340
we can sign it.

655
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,780
Have you really made up your mind?

656
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,380
I couldn't hope for anything better.

657
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
There's nothing to think about.

658
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,780
Why are you here?

659
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,580
Why is Mr. Lu here?

660
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,060
For business cooperation.

661
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,380
Cooperation?

662
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,020
Mr. Lu has decided
to merge his sales company

663
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,780
with the food factory
through equity exchange.

664
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,060
This way, we'll have new sales channels

665
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,700
and can renegotiate with the Italians.

666
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,140
I didn't expect Mr. Lu
to be so interested in

667
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
the factory's affairs
after leaving for so many years.

668
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,220
Thank you.

669
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,980
It's not a big deal.

670
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,780
This is a win-win decision.

671
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,940
Alright,

672
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,340
I'll leave you to your conversation.

673
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,020
I won't disturb you.

674
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,820
Is there anything I can do for you?

675
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,180
Ciao, Mr. Mancini.

676
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,140
I would like to invite you
to have dinner this evening.

677
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,380
Alright.

678
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,740
That's good.

679
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,220
See you then.

680
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,020
Mr. Mancini has checked out?

681
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,980
Yes, it was an impromptu check-out

682
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,140
at 2 PM today.

683
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,300
No wonder we couldn't reach him by phone.

684
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,260
Did he leave any message?

685
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,540
No.

686
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,980
He suddenly left at 2 PM

687
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,060
without contacting us.

688
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,660
Huang Qing and I had a deal.

689
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,060
I have four days left
to regain authorization

690
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,860
for the OEM factory.

691
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,420
If I can't secure a new

692
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,700
OEM brand by then,

693
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,220
he might change his mind.

694
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,060
I won't let anyone

695
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,420
stand in your way of doing what you want.

696
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,580
I'll help you get what you want,

697
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
your freedom.

698
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,380
Let's go to your office.

699
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,620
All the resources

700
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,020
and connections I've accumulated

701
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,340
over the years are here.

702
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,740
Then let's get started.

703
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,820
Hello?

704
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,540
Mr. He, it's me,

705
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,380
Xiaolu.

706
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,180
We have a new project and would like to

707
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,140
discuss it with you.

708
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,020
Really?

709
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,420
Okay,

710
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,700
tell me about it.

711
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,540
I saw Lu Xiaolu and Bai Lan

712
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,020
at the front desk just now.

713
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,580
I think

714
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,740
they must have heard about
Mr. Mancini's situation.

715
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,940
Vice Mayor Bi.

716
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,780
- Here?
- He's inside.

717
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,300
I'm sorry

718
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,860
to bother you so late.

719
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,820
Mr. Huang.

720
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,820
It's good to take a walk.

721
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,860
Good for my health.

722
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,220
Mayor Bi, we're good friends,

723
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,460
so I'll be direct.

724
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,340
I want to expedite the acquisition

725
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
of the remaining 40% stake
of the food factory

726
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,660
to complete the purchase of

727
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,140
the factory's land and assets thoroughly.

728
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,580
This is necessary

729
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,380
for me to proceed with my plans.

730
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,620
That's excellent.

731
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,740
We're on the same page.

732
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,340
We really need to move quickly.

733
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
Reliable, huh?

734
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,340
Alright, tell me

735
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,780
about your plans.

736
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,580
Any suggestions?

737
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,100
Well, I envision

738
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,700
constructing a large commercial plaza

739
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,020
on the food factory site

740
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,580
to make it a landmark

741
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,060
in Fucheng's development history.

742
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,820
What do you think?

743
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,300
Building a commercial plaza
is indeed a good idea.

744
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,660
I'll present this plan
to the city authorities.

745
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,340
However, actual construction will be

746
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,820
time-consuming and resource-intensive.

747
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,620
My current financial and energy resources
don't fully support this.

748
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,500
Are you thinking of

749
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,500
selling it off later?

750
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,860
How do you predict

751
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,300
Fucheng's future land prices will increase?

752
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,380
In my opinion,

753
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,500
within six to eight years,

754
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,130
tripling to quintupling the current value
shouldn't be an issue.

755
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,460
I'm more optimistic.

756
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,980
I'd say within five years,

757
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,980
it could quintuple.

758
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,260
So, I plan to hold onto it
for at least five years

759
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,900
and assess the situation later.

760
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
If you

761
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,460
apply for approval

762
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,260
for a large commercial plaza

763
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,460
and it's granted,

764
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,780
you can't delay the construction.

765
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,420
That might lead to criticism.

766
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,060
So I need your assistance.

767
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,020
I don't want to commit to

768
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,940
a specific construction timeline.

769
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,780
If you can help me with this,

770
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,940
I'll be very grateful to you.

771
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,180
We can discuss that later.

772
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Normally,

773
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,740
constructing
such a large commercial plaza

774
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,940
would take about three years,

775
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,420
five years

776
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,220
is a bit too long.

777
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,140
But it's okay.

778
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,980
I'll try to help with that.

779
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,100
Once you acquire the land,

780
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,740
you need to make some noise.

781
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,940
Don't worry.

782
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,020
After I acquire the land,

783
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,420
I'll start demolishing the food factory,

784
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,820
and make the land ready.

785
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,060
And then I'll hire a word-famous designer

786
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,980
to do that design.

787
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,100
How long will it take?

788
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,180
Who knows?

789
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,660
Of course,

790
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,460
you also

791
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,180
have to solve the problems
of the workers.

792
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,780
Before the demolition,

793
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,860
pay off outstanding wages

794
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,260
and medical expenses.

795
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,260
The city places great importance

796
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,700
on stability and unity.

797
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,220
I'll do my best.

798
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
One more thing I must say,

799
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,420
and I hope you won't take offense.

800
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,900
Go ahead.

801
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,900
Control your woman.

802
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,620
If she successfully revitalizes

803
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,580
the food factory,

804
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,700
the cost of acquiring

805
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,220
the full ownership

806
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,220
in the future

807
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,220
will be significantly higher and

808
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,220
possibly unacceptable.

809
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,500
So,

810
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,220
don't let Miss Bai
cause any trouble for us.

811
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,540
Don't worry,

812
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,700
she won't be a problem.
