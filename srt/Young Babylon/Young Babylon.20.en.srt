Just use this as a cushion.

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,030
Thank you.

27
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,330
Earlier, I had a bad temper

28
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,420
and spoke too harshly.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Don't take it to heart.

30
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,790
It's okay.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,940
You have your difficulties.

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,500
You've seen it all.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,940
The issue with the cold storage
isn't just about me.

34
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,460
Li Guangnan just got married
to Little Pouter

35
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,260
and still owes a mortgage.

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,700
Xiaoying has been working tirelessly

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,140
to support Big Feet's dream.

38
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,540
Over these years,

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,900
we have experienced

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,700
hardship and obstacles together.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,180
Even if I want to help you,

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,020
I can't ignore their feelings.

43
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,660
You all have been through a lot.

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,700
But who hasn't?

45
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,540
Yes,

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,540
I understand.

47
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,140
You have your life

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,020
and your job.

49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,580
But these people in Fucheng

50
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,220
all used to be your friends.

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,060
I've long forgotten what happened

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,140
here in the past.

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,540

I thought you two were like

63

the characters
in "The Return of the Condor Hero".

64
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,980
Even after 16 years apart,

65
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,020
they could pick up where they left off.

66
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,100
Looks like those martial arts novels
are all fake.

67
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,340
She isn't the Dragon Lady,

68
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,580
you aren't Yang Guo.

69
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,380
And Shanghai

70
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,140
is definitely not the Valley of Woe.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,340
Let me tell you,

72
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,940
a woman like her

73
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,060
is probably free and carefree

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,780
in that flashy world of Shanghai.

75
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,260
What are you to her?

76
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,420
Just a fleeting memory,

77
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,660
gone in an instant.

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,180
We even wanted to use
the past memories to persuade her.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,380
We've failed before we even start.

80
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,500
Honey,

81
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,180
please help me talk to him.

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,700
The one who backed out back then

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,980
was not Bai Lan,

84
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,500
but you, Lu Xiaolu.

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,220
You came back to Fucheng.

86
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,820
You have family, a job,

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
and relatives.

88
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,020
What about Bai Lan?

89
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,620
She was alone in Shanghai.

90
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,300
She couldn't finish her master's degree.

91
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,460
She had no money, no house,

92
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,740
nothing.

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,820
What did you just say?

94
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,780
She couldn't finish

95
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,700
her master's degree?

96
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,940
What do you mean?

97
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
See for yourself.

98
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,740
Over these five years,

99
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,100
we've been in contact.

100
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,620
Although she never

101
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,940
complained in her letters,

102
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,220
I can feel that

103
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,060
she's had it tough.

104
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,700
You two have been exchanging letters?

105
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,740
Why don't I know that?

106
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,940
(Bai Lan)

107
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,260
In 1997,

108
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,100
she was expelled from school,

109
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,460
had nowhere to live,

110
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,940
and even slept in the company's
storage room.

111
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,100
In 1998,

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,740
she became a regular employee,

113
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,220
was promoted several times
in three months,

114
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,060
but because of her busy work

115
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,940
and determination,

116
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,380
she got gastritis.

117
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,140
In 1999,

118
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,820
she went to Europe alone

119
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,660
and successfully signed

120
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,740
the first contract
between British clients and China.

121
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,340
In 2001,

122
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,540
she happened to be in Beijing

123
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,330
when the Olympics were successfully bid.

124
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,380
There was a live broadcast,

125
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
and she said she was especially happy

126
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,820
standing at Tian'anmen Square

127
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,380
with over 400,000 people
watching the flag-raising.

128
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,020
Lu Xiaolu,

129
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,700
during her most difficult times,

130
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,620
you weren't by her side.

131
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,860
Now,

132
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,900
her career is her armor.

133
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,180
What right do you have

134
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,100
to think she would compromise for you?

135
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,260
Don't worry, no one followed us.

136
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,700
Master Niu,

137
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,580
everyone from the workshops is here,

138
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,620
waiting for your command.

139
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
I heard yesterday
that the Security Department

140
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,940
clashed with Xiaolu's group.

141
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,820
It seems Bai Lan isn't even

142
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,220
considering Lu Xiaolu's feelings.

143
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,020
You don't understand.

144
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,860
When former lovers meet,

145
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,420
it's even more contentious
than meeting enemies.

146
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,220
I never thought Bai Lan

147
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,060
was easy to deal with back then.

148
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,940
Now that even Lu Xiaolu isn't
accommodating her,

149
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,180
why should we care about her?

150
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,140
In my opinion,

151
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,380
we should just kick her out of the factory.

152
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,820
With so many of us,

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,020
what's there to fear from her alone?

154
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,860
Am I right?

155
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,700
Exactly!

156
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,260
Guys! Guys!

157
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,900
Guys!

158
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,500
We are workers,

159
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,060
not thugs.

160
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,460
Besides, she's a woman.

161
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,060
Master Niu,

162
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,780
don't just see her as an ordinary woman.

163
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,220
She acts like she's tougher than ten men.

164
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,140
If we don't show her some backbone now,

165
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,460
who knows who she'll target next?

166
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,100
The older you get,

167
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,940
the more...

168
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,180
Not being thugs

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,140
doesn't mean we're timid.

170
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,100
Master,

171
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,380
what's your plan now?

172
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,300
Everyone,

173
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,740
do you know how

174
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,820
the Soviet Union disintegrated?

175
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,900
Yes, we do.

176
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,460
To achieve victory in our struggle,

177
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,980
we don't necessarily

178
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,100
need weapons.

179
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,980
So are you saying

180
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,660
we should refuse to work

181
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,140
until we get paid?

182
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,100
♪We always on time♪

183
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,180
As long as we're united,

184
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,220
I don't believe we can't outlast her.

185
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,900
Master is right.
I think this plan will work.

186
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,300
That's how we will do it.

187
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,940
Alright,
let's conclude today's meeting here.

188
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,540
Everyone, go home.
Let's not bring this up again,

189
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,420
especially you, Dakang.

190
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,140
Let it go, okay?

191
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,700
Let's go.

192
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,980
Let's go.

193
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,580
When will this end?

194
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,340
What are you thinking?

195
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Haven't you heard?

196
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,380
The factory is going to implement

197
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,980
layoffs and reassignments.

198
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,700
This means they'll lay off
all of us who haven't performed well.

199
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,300
Where did you hear this?

200
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,100
Don't scare yourself.

201
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,460
How am I scaring myself?

202
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,300
This is being prepared for the future.

203
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,620
If you don't prepare now

204
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,980
and Bai Lan puts

205
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,580
your name on the layoff list,

206
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,740
you'll regret it.

207
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,620
What are you planning to do then?

208
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,740
Master Niu is a gentleman.

209
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,780
I'm not.

210
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,860
Hey, Dakang!

211
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
Dakang!

212
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,100
(What about Bai Lan?)

213
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,700
(She was alone in Shanghai.)

214
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,420
(She couldn't finish her master's degree.)

215
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,980
(She had no money, no house,)

216
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,380
(nothing.)

217
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,660
(The one who backed out back then)

218
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,900
(was not Bai Lan,)

219
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,300
(but you, Lu Xiaolu.)

220
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
(You came back to Fucheng.)

221
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,300
(You have family, a job,)

222
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
(and relatives.)

223
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,660
(What about Bai Lan?)

224
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,260
You all have been through a lot.

225
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,020
But who hasn't?

226
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,060
- Bai Lan!
- Xiaolu!

227
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,220
Xiaolu!

228
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,740
Bai Lan, are you okay?

229
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm fine.

230
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,020
- Are you hurt?
- No.

231
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,260
I slipped

232
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,980
and broke the light cord.

233
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,460
(Gongyuan)

234
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,020
You couldn't tell who he is?

235
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,100
I really didn't see clearly.

236
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,740
When I went in,

237
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,260
I saw blood all over the walls,

238
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,140
which startled me,

239
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,100
so I slipped

240
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,220
and broke the light cord.

241
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,500
Okay.

242
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,340
Did you see anything?

243
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,620
I vaguely saw a blurry figure,

244
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,020
quite tall.

245
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,980
This is really terrible.

246
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,980
Wu. I've been in this factory for decades

247
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,500
and nothing like this has ever happened.

248
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,100
Don't worry, though.

249
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,780
We have surveillance cameras
in the factory.

250
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,930
We'll definitely be able
to identify this person.

251
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,140
- You have surveillance?
- Yes.

252
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,620
Then it's simple.

253
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,060
Let's go check the surveillance footage.

254
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,900
Yeah, let's go.

255
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,940
There's no need to look.

256
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,660
The one who threw pig's blood

257
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,740
- is me.
- Hey, Master Niu!

258
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,700
Don't joke around.

259
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
Master,

260
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,940
it couldn't be you.

261
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,980
Why couldn't it be?

262
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,620
Yesterday, at the cold storage,

263
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,620
my daughter

264
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,660
was surrounded and pushed

265
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,100
because of her.

266
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
You know,

267
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,540
as a father,

268
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,500
watching your daughter being bullied,

269
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,940
what would I do?

270
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,660
Since that's the case,

271
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
Master Niu,

272
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,820
come back to the police station with me.

273
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,020
Sure, let's go.

274
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,380
- No, no, no.
- Uncle Wu.

275
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,220
Wait a moment.

276
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,820
Officer,

277
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
I withdraw the report.

278
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,300
You...

279
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,420
This is an internal issue
within our own factory.

280
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
We'll handle it ourselves.

281
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,060
Yes, that's right.

282
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,460
Have you thought this through?

283
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,780
If you withdraw your report,

284
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,780
more serious incidents may occur
in the future.

285
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
I've thought it through.

286
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,020
Thank you for your trouble.

287
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,500
Alright.

288
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,140
Let's go.

289
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,780
Wu, thank you for your hard work.

290
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,300
Master Niu,

291
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,460
I trust you.

292
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,980
You're an upright person

293
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,100
and wouldn't do something like this.

294
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,460
I understand you want to protect someone,

295
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,820
but please believe me,

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
I don't want to hurt them.

297
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,180
Stop!

298
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,460
Come here.

299
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,340
Come here.

300
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,940
What...

301
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,740
What were you doing?

302
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,580
I...

303
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,020
Did you commit murder or slaughter a pig?

304
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,100
You won't talk, huh?

305
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,340
Fine, I'll have

306
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,700
Officer Wu come and question you.

307
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,540
Hey, Master Niu.

308
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,420
I just wanted to teach Bai Lan a lesson.

309
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
A lesson?

310
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,580
Do you know

311
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,820
what time it is now?

312
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,420
If you make even the slightest mistake,

313
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,620
you'll be the first one

314
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,260
they come after.

315
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,380
Do you understand?

316
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,700
Hurry up, find a place where no one is

317
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,540
and clean up this blood.

318
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,700
- Alright, alright.
- Quickly.

319
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,660
Thank you, Master Niu.

320
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
Nobody wants to be a villain,

321
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,820
but someone always ends up getting hurt.

322
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,140
I'll take you to a safe place.

323
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,700
Although we're not friends right now,

324
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,720
I still don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

325
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,340
Tomorrow,

326
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,060
we can continue being enemies.

327
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,100
You are still living here

328
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,420
after so many years?

329
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,100
I've gotten used to it

330
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,700
and can't be bothered to move.

331
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,780
I'll tidy up the room for you.

332
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,020
You can stay here tonight
with peace of mind.

333
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,980
In the whole Fucheng,

334
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,460
no one dares to harm you.

335
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,580
Thank you.

336
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,260
Dajiang.

337
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,900
You're back.

338
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,380
You're back, too.

339
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,340
It's different.

340
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,340
You've returned in glory,

341
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,780
while I...

342
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,820
I'm not who I was already.

343
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,460
I hope you don't hold a grudge against me

344
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,700
for handing you over to the police.

345
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,540
What are you saying?

346
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,060
I should thank you.

347
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
If it weren't for your words back then,

348
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,780
I might not have

349
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,060
understood many things.

350
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,820
Besides,

351
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,220
how could I hate

352
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,580
my cousin's woman?

353
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,700
Alright, enough talking.

354
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,740
This place is all yours.

355
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,860
Dajiang,

356
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,900
where are you going?

357
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,700
The neighborhood committee
arranged a job for me.

358
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,220
I'm leaving.

359
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,460
(First Love)

360
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,780
You've kept these things all this time.

361
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,300
I thought you would have
thrown them away.

362
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,460
I don't like throwing things away.

363
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,380
But some things aren't important anymore

364
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,220
and can be discarded.

365
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,020
But what if the memories are too deep

366
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,860
to forget?

367
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,540
Then it becomes a burden for yourself

368
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
and others.

369
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,940
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,180
Sorry for what?

371
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,820
It's only today that I learned about

372
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,860
you being expelled
from school in Shanghai.

373
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,740
It wasn't a big deal.

374
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,620
And it's long past.

375
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,900
After that,

376
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,780
did you live the life you wanted?

377
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,100
Have you become the person
you wanted to be?

378
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,820
I don't know.

379
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,820
Over these years,

380
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,180
all I've known is that I have to

381
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,580
keep running forward,

382
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,220
but it seems I don't know
where the finish line is.

383
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,340
It wasn't until today when I came to
your office looking for you,

384
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,380
almost thinking I'd never see you again,

385
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,580
that I realized

386
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,420
my finish line isn't in the future

387
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,340
but in the past.

388
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,340
If I could go back to a certain time
in the past...

389
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,660
If I could have

390
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,540
made a different choice back then...

391
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,220
Hello?

392
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,620
I knew you hadn't rested yet.

393
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,740
Must be tough, huh?

394
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,340
I was just about to rest.

395
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,940
Is everything going smoothly?

396
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,900
Still working on it.

397
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,260
OK.

398
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,540
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

399
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,500
You've still got me.

400
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,660
Tomorrow, I'll personally
make a trip to Fucheng.

401
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,260
Do you doubt that I can handle it myself?

402
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,100
No,

403
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,460
I just want to see for myself

404
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,140
this beautiful city you speak of.

405
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,300
Why? You don't want me there?

406
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,500
As soon as the negotiations were over,

407
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,340
I booked the earliest flight for tomorrow.

408
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,140
Alright,

409
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,940
I'll go pick you up at the airport.

410
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,900
Your boyfriend?

411
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,020
Get some rest.

412
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,220
Tomorrow morning,

413
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,940
I'll take you to the best hotel in Fucheng.

414
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Lu Xiaolu,

415
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,460
even if we could go back to the past,

416
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,980
you wouldn't have had a second choice.

417
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,980
The choice you made was the only one.

418
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,660
Get some rest.

419
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,260
Are you going to
give me the money or not?

420
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,180
I told you, all the money
was gambled away by you.

421
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,540
- No more left.
- Stop talking nonsense

422
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,380
and give me the money.

423
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,140
What do you want?
Are you trying to rob me?

424
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,760
- Are you giving it to me or not?
- I told you there's none.

425
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,140
- Give it to me.
- I told you...

426
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,500
- Let go!
- You...

427
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,340
Let go.

428
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,180
Speak nicely.

429
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,020
Don't hit a woman.

430
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,100
I'm teaching my woman a lesson.

431
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,100
What's it to you?

432
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,380
What's it to you?

433
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,340
Mind your own business.

434
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,700
Look at your stupid face!

435
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,940
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,180
I shouldn't have intervened.

437
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,340
You are sorry?

438
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,180
Now you are sorry?

439
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,940
You're not so tough now, huh?

440
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,660
Get off me.

441
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,340
- Enough.
- Stupid dustman.

442
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,720
- That's enough.
- You'll be a dustman forever.

443
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,820
- How stupid.
- Enough, let's go.

444
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,340
Give me the money.

445
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,980
I don't have any left.

446
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,900
How could you have none left?

447
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,780
Go apologize to the cleaner.

448
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,460
Who do you think you are

449
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,300
to ask me to apologize?

450
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,780
Go and apologize,

451
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,100
and you'll get this money.

452
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
Will you do it or not?

453
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,700
Alright,

454
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,660
I'll go now.

455
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,140
Wait a moment.

456
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,300
Give this to him.

457
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,740
Well,

458
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,300
dude.

459
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,060
I was wrong just now.

460
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,460
I apologize to you.

461
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

462
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,580
I see your hands are bleeding.

463
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,620
Use this

464
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,700
to wrap it.

465
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Sorry, dude.

466
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,340
Hurry up.

467
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,860
Ms. Tao,

468
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,260
do you know that person?

469
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,340
An old friend.

470
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,940
Old friend?

471
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,380
Do you want to go say hello?

472
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,980
Forget it.

473
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,940
When he wants to see me,

474
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,020
he'll come.

475
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,740
When I was in Hong Kong,

476
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,220
a client gave this to me.

477
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,180
Take this as a reward
for the task in Fucheng.

478
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,860
But Mr. Huang,

479
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,820
you're mistaken.

480
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,900
I'm doing this task for myself.

481
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,780
Since it's for myself,

482
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,740
why do I need a reward?

483
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,580
Lyu,

484
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,180
take this watch.

485
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,140
When you have a girlfriend in the future,

486
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,020
you can give it to her.

487
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,220
Oh, and

488
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,380
I've already arranged your accommodation

489
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,980
at the best hotel in Fucheng.

490
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
Tonight,

491
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,300
I have dinner plans
with an important figure in Fucheng.

492
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,740
Arrange it at this hotel for me.

493
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,780
Okay.

494
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,700
I don't have appetite.

495
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
Xiaoying,

496
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,260
bring me the liquor.

497
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,620
You can't drink again!

498
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,100
Did you recover
from last night's drinking?

499
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,940
And you want more?

500
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,300
My heart is troubled

501
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,580
until the matters in the factory

502
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,420
are resolved.

503
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,340
You're at such an age,

504
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,220
why are you so temperamental?

505
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,460
What about you?

506
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,100
You're out there every day

507
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
fighting and causing trouble.

508
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,900
Dad,

509
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,740
you'll retire next year.

510
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,820
Why not enjoy some peace and quiet?

511
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,300
I fight and cause trouble

512
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,940
to protect our business

513
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,780
and earn a bit more money

514
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
for your retirement.

515
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,940
Huh, bah!

516
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,460
Don't think I don't know that

517
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,820
you send

518
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,660
most of the money

519
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,180
to Big Feet.

520
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,740
I'm investing in love.

521
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,100
If Big Feet succeeds in the future,

522
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,300
who will be proud?

523
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,340
It's you, the master.

524
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
Who will benefit from it?

525
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,340
It's you, the father-in-law.

526
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,460
Oh, come on.

527
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,700
You are hardly a couple,

528
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,140
and now I'm his father-in-law already?

529
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,220
As a young girl,

530
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,980
aren't you embarrassed?

531
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,820
I learned it from you,

532
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,660
cheeky Master Niu.

533
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,820
Let me tell you,
I don't approve of you two.

534
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,700
Big Feet is my apprentice.

535
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,580
I know him well.

536
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,740
People say

537
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
you can see a person's future

538
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,260
when he's at seven.

539
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,180
He used

540
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,860
to be worthless,

541
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,420
and growing up won't change that.

542
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,380
What are you saying?

543
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,700
How can you say that?

544
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,660
He's successful now.

545
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,820
Just the other day, he told me

546
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
he wrote a new song,

547
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,540
and several big bosses

548
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,780
are fighting to sign him.

549
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,780
You're just bragging,

550
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,860
you know.

551
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,060
You never understand.

552
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,900
Who is it?

553
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,580
- Did you invite someone?
- No.

554
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,780
Xiaoying,

555
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,980
I'm back.

556
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,860
How... You...

557
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,260
Dad,

558
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,180
guess who's back.

559
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,420
Master.

560
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,900
I thought you'd never come back.

561
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,820
I almost didn't recognize you

562
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,060
after all these years.

563
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,340
What's with this long hair,

564
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,100
you look like a woman now.

565
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,900
Artists are all like this.

566
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,020
So cool!

567
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,980
Stand there,

568
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,860
and look at what you're wearing.

569
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,260
With those big and small holes,

570
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,180
they'd think
you're begging on the streets.

571
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,380
Rock'n'roll

572
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,820
is all about attitude.

573
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,460
And look at this outfit.

574
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,220
You are dressed like a street thug.

575
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,500
Singer is a proper profession,

576
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,420
destined to become a big star.

577
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,740
You mean singing

578
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,020
can fill up your wallet?

579
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,500
So is it fair

580
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,180
for those hard-working laborers?

581
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,740
You won't understand anyway.

582
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,100
Master,

583
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,460
I brought some specialties
from Beijing for you.

584
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,780
Roast duck,

585
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,940
dried fruits.

586
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,060
Look.

587
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,820
And herbal jelly.

588
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,700
Have you ever tried it?

589
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,260
You've lived for so long,

590
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,030
but have you ever been to Beijing?

591
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,820
He brought you Beijing roast duck.

592
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,740
I've tried it before.

593
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,460
When Debao went to Beijing years ago,

594
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,700
he also brought back roast duck.

595
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,580
You also ate it.

596
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,540
Besides,

597
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,700
are you out of your mind

598
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,140
or what?

599
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,220
We work in a food factory,

600
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,140
and you bring dried fruits from Beijing?

601
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,780
These are from Beijing.

602
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,100
I'll eat them if you won't.

603
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,820
I...

604
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,940
Master, you're right.

605
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,820
I've been...

606
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,100
You don't need to be afraid of him.

607
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
The older he gets,
the more sour his temper gets.

608
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,860
Go tidy up,

609
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,380
I'll call Xiaolu and the others,

610
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
and we'll have a feast tonight

611
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,220
to welcome you back.

612
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,780
Let me take this.

613
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,540
Master, I'll go tidy up then.

614
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,820
Why are you staring at me?

615
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,580
Before,

616
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,220
why didn't I notice

617
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,100
you are so handsome?

618
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,020
- Alright, enough.
- Stop staring, Xiaoying.

619
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,740
You look like you are gonna eat me.

620
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,540
When they come in later,
it'll be embarrassing.

621
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm staring.

622
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,340
I'll eat you up when we get back.

623
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,500
Chen Guowei!

624
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,740
They are here.

625
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Guangnan!

626
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,740
What's wrong with you?

627
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,580
You went to Beijing
and never returned in years.

628
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
I thought you forgot us
after becoming a big star.

629
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,100
- Not at all.
- He wouldn't dare.

630
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,900
He came to see you
right after he came back.

631
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,300
And he brought you gifts.

632
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,300
That's not necessary.

633
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,540
Take it. Come on.

634
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,940
Alright.

635
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,340
Welcome home.

636
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,020
Xiaolu.

637
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,460
- Ms. Tao.
- Ms. Tao.

638
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,540
Is this room satisfactory?

639
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,810
I've reserved the largest one for you.

640
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,020
- Yes.
- Of course.

641
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,060
Ms. Tao.

642
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,860
Big Feet, you've seen him before.

643
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,540
He is now a big star.

644
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,820
- A big star?
- Not at all.

645
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,740
Not bad.

646
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,980
In the future,
if you have a concert in Fucheng,

647
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,220
I will arrange it for you.

648
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,660
Great! Come on, say thank you.

649
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,340
Alright, enjoy your time.

650
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,780
- I'll leave first.
- Okay, sure.

651
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,220
- Have fun!
- Thank you, Ms. Tao.

652
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,940
In the next few days,

653
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,540
I'll introduce you to some people.

654
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,820
This is my first time in Fucheng.

655
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,220
Come in.

656
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,340
Sorry for being late.

657
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,700
Let me introduce.

658
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,940
She is the project manager of our company

659
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,780
and also in charge of

660
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,980
this Fucheng Food Factory project.

661
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,740
Her name is Bai Lan.

662
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,220
Manager Bai,

663
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,180
nice to meet you.

664
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,980
Mr. Huang,

665
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,460
you may not know,

666
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,300
but when I was in the SLI Bureau,

667
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,220
I worked with Miss Bai.

668
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,740
She was my subordinate.

669
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,900
Back then,

670
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,740
I had high hopes for her.

671
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,940
Is that so?

672
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,460
I never expected that.

673
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,780
Without Vice Mayor Bi,

674
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,100
I'm afraid I wouldn't be
where I am today.

675
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,900
Well, if that's the case,

676
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,060
Miss Bai,

677
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,660
you must

678
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,740
toast me a drink.

679
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,580
Come in.

680
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,260
- Mayor Bi.
- Hello, Ms. Tao.

681
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,060
Here, these are a gift for your friends.

682
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,740
- Great.
- Would you like to join us?

683
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,220
You have important matters to discuss,

684
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
and I don't want to disturb you.

685
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,380
When you're free,

686
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
I'll invite you to the bar upstairs

687
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,140
for a drink.

688
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,300
Sure.

689
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,900
Enjoy yourselves.

690
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,860
Okay.

691
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,140
Miss Bai doesn't handle alcohol well.

692
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,820
Let me drink for her.

693
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,100
Mr. Huang,

694
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,740
everything is destined.

695
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,860
For example,

696
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,140
the connection between

697
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,900
your company and the food factory,

698
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,620
and my connection

699
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,700
with Miss Bai.

700
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,460
These are irreplaceable.

701
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,220
Am I right, Miss Bai?

702
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,620
Vice Mayor Bi is right.

703
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,340
With our connection,

704
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,980
we definitely need to drink.

705
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,740
But one drink cup is not enough.

706
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,780
If we're drinking,

707
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,820
let's have a bottle each.

708
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,980
If we don't finish it tonight,

709
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,820
no one leaves.

710
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,060
What do you think?

711
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,820
Okay.

712
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,300
Are you alright?

713
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,620
Why are you here too?

714
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
These past few years,

715
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,700
many have been

716
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,940
eyeing the food factory.

717
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,340
There was a local tycoon before

718
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,860
and foreign capital after,

719
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,340
but

720
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,420
nothing came of it.

721
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,900
So, Mr. Huang,

722
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,380
be prepared for fruitless efforts.

723
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,940
I never do anything without certainty.

724
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,220
I always have a backup plan

725
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,020
to avoid coming back empty-handed.

726
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,300
Good.

727
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,460
It looks like

728
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,300
you've already prepared a backup plan.

729
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,700
I'm sure you understand the situation

730
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,060
of the food factory better than me.

731
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,820
I'll take your advice.

732
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,540
This food factory

733
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,340
is indeed

734
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,900
a fat piece of meat.

735
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,060
Everyone wants it.

736
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,020
But

737
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,700
have you ever thought that...

738
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,260
The bones are the most valuable part.

739
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,260
Actually,
I've thought about it before coming.

740
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,700
The production cycle is long,

741
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,660
and the profit margin is thin,

742
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,340
not worth it.

743
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,300
With such a prime location,

744
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,460
the food factory could be maximized

745
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,740
by developing real estate.

746
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,220
Very clever.

747
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,340
But

748
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,860
I must remind you,

749
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,500
some leaders in the city committee

750
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,340
have strong sentiments towards

751
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,620
Golden Peacock Food Factory.

752
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,420
They can't bear to see it collapse.

753
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,220
But the most difficult part

754
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,540
is dealing with the factory workers.

755
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,220
If you

756
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,540
really want this piece of land,

757
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
first,

758
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,100
you should deal with

759
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,660
the resistance from the workers.

760
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,340
Understand.

761
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,260
Come in.

762
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,900
- This is...
- Let me introduce.

763
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,380
This is Mr. Huang.

764
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,140
Hello, Mr. Huang.

765
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,740
- You're from Guangdong?
- Yes, I am.

766
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,020
This is Mr. Hu

767
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,060
of Lide Construction Company.

768
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,780
People call him Boss Hu.

769
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,460
Mr. Huang, if you ever encounter

770
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,180
any problems you can't solve,

771
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,980
Boss Hu will help you handle them.

772
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,340
I don't have any special skills,

773
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,540
but over these years in Fucheng,

774
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,220
I've gained some abilities

775
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,260
to handle some small matters.

776
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,340
Come on.

777
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,300
Mr. Huang,

778
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,780
a toast to you.

779
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,260
Call me if you need me for anything.

780
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,740
Thank you.

781
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,260
You have important matters to discuss,

782
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,660
I won't disturb you.

783
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,500
Sure.

784
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,140
You can go.

785
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
Where is Miss Bai?

786
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,340
I'll go check on her.

787
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,500
Big Feet is back

788
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,930
and we are having dinner together.

789
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,860
Do you want to join us?

790
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,660
I have a business dinner.

791
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,740
Please send my regards to him.

792
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,380
Since it's about work,

793
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,820
why must you drink so much?

794
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,140
What do you think

795
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,140
my work was like over these past years?

796
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,660
I've seen all kinds of difficult situations.

797
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,300
This is nothing at all.

798
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,620
What took you so long?

799
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,540
Are you alright?

800
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,340
I'm fine.

801
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,420
This is...

802
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,220
He's a friend of mine from Fucheng.

803
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
Nice to meet you.

804
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,740
Nice to meet you too.

805
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,620
Let's go.

806
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,500
Xiaoying,

807
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,340
you've invested in a promising stock.

808
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,540
Things will be good in the future.

809
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,380
Speaking of which,

810
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,740
Big Feet, you're really something.

811
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,740
When you went to Beijing alone back then,

812
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,100
it's the bravest

813
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,620
and wisest decision

814
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,060
I've seen you make so far.

815
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,260
Look at our factory now.

816
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,700
Many people
can't even receive their wages.

817
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,980
I regret not going to Beijing with you.

818
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,700
Oh, yes, I heard

819
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,180
he's really famous in Beijing.

820
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,340
The big bosses who want to sign him

821
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,380
are lining up from Tian'anmen Square
to the Great Wall.

822
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,220
- Is that true?
- No.

823
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,740
No, it's not.

824
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,480
You know,

825
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,580
it takes a day and a night to walk

826
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,860
from Tian'anmen Square to the Great Wall.

827
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,140
Besides, I just sing

828
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,300
in a bar street,

829
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,020
and there are hardly
any audience members.

830
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,340
It would take more than a day and a night?

831
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,780
- Beijing is so big?
- It's quite big.

832
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,940
I haven't been there yet.

833
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
Hey, how about this?

834
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
When we go on our honeymoon,

835
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,020
let's go to Beijing.

836
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,420
You always say that,

837
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,700
but you never have time.

838
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,540
You keep delaying.

839
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,130
- I don't believe your nonsense.
- I'll wait for you.

840
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,340
Oh, it's because of work.

841
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,180
Chen Guowei,

842
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,980
didn't you write a song for me?

843
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
When will you sing it for me?

844
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,620
- I...
- Don't forget about us.

845
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,180
Write a song for us too.

846
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,820
We are not greedy.

847
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,780
We just want one.

848
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,780
No problem.

849
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,980
Then Xiaolu's song should be...

850
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,300
What can he get?

851
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,220
"A Song for a Single Man"?

852
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,860
Of course not.

853
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,780
His song should be

854
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,660
"When Love Becomes the Past".

855
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,380
You're really mean.

856
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,060
Xiaolu, come on, cheers.

857
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,700
Cheers, come on.

858
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,740
