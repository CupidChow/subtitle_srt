a person.

66

were stalked by him.

We were all scared.

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,420

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,100

Yeah.

you left the party early yesterday

your work performance
has been outstanding.

114
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,060
So, upon my suggestion,

115
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,030
and with the unanimous agreement
of the bureau leaders,

116
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,220
it was decided

117
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,180
to allocate this graduate opportunity

118
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,540

Ding Dezhong's son?

122
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,700
That's not right.

123
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,300
I heard from people at the factory

124
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,700
that his son joined the army.

125
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,990
He's been bragging about it to everyone.

126
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,420
Wu from the police station knows him

127
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,860
and said he has a mental illness.

128
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,940
I guess Ding Dezhong
didn't want to lose face,

129
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,700
so he kept his son hidden at home

130
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,540
without telling anyone.

131
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,460
Where is he now?

132
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,430
I sent him to the Security Department.

133
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,500
But Wu said
he has a mental illness certificate,

134
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,320
so there's no way
to hold him accountable.

135
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,280
We can only ask Ding Dezhong
to take good care of him.

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,620
What does that mean?

137
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,660
Are we just going to let this slide?

138
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,300
What about those girls?

139
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,380
They were harassed for nothing?

140
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,220
Exactly.

141
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,500
Hey, could that
mental illness certificate

142
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,980
be fake

143
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,820
like the one Afang had?

144
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,740
If it's fake,

145
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,300
it won't pass scrutiny.

146
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,540
But if it's real,

147
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,900
he should be sent to a hospital.

148
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,260
If Ding Dezhong could handle him,

149
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,980
he wouldn't have been able
to do so many bad things.

150
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,500

151
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,500

- Listen to me.
- Yu.

157
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,380
He did something wrong.
It's our fault as parents.

158
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,540
We didn't teach him well.

159
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,580
You can't treat him like this.

160
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,780
Listen to me, listen to me.

161
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,860
Captain Wu, listen to me.

162
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,100
If there's anything, tell us.

163
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
We adults are responsible.

164
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,300
- It's our fault.
- Let's get him to the hospital first.

165
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,860
- No, no.
- Are you planning to go home just like this?

166
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,300
Let's hospitalize the child first.

167
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,380
Your son has scared so many people.

168
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,970
Aren't you going to explain something?

169
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm here.

- Dajiang.

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,620
- Don't be afraid.
- It's our family's trouble.

You've seen it all.

173
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,140
We're all family here. Do me a favor.

174

What are you doing?

178
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,100
You can't do this.

What are you trying to do?

184
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,100
Is there no law anymore?

185
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,820
Stop hitting.

186
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,300
Stop shouting!

187
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
I think

188
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,180
we should take him to the hospital.

189
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,420
In case something happens,

190
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,180
nobody can bear the responsibility.

191
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,100
- No, no.
- Is that right?

192
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,820
No one can take Yu away.

193
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,380
Yu can't leave me. No.

194
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,860
Mrs. Ding, listen to me.

195
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,940
Mrs. Ding, hear me out.

196
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,140
Auntie!

197
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,740
Yu!

198
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,220
Mom! Mom!

199
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,540
Yu! Yu!

200
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,820
Mr. and Mrs. Ding,

201
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,180
I'll go with him, okay?

202
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,740
- I'll go.
- Alright, alright.

203
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,100
Yu, I'm here.

204
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,620
Listen to me. Ma will be with him.

205
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,580
Yu!

206
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,500
Auntie.

207
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,540
Alright.

208
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,380
Lu Dajiang,

209
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,060
since you are ruthless towards me,

210
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,580
don't blame me for not showing mercy.

211
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,100
Let's wait and see.

212
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,540
No need to work in the Bureau today?

213
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,660
The task is over.

214
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,580
I'm back to where I came from.

215
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,220
I thought...

216
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
What did you think?

217
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
Thought being seconded to the Bureau

218
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,940
would turn me

219
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,900
from a small factory doctor

220
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,020
into an official who drives a sedan?

221
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,580
Actually, I wasn't thinking.

222
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,580
I was afraid.

223
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,940
I hate those petty officials

224
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,780
who act all high and mighty.

225
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,420
I can't even imagine

226
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,980
what if one day the person I like

227
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,500
becomes like that.

228
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,140
I...

229
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,980
I mean,

230
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,060
I still prefer
how you look in a white coat.

231
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,540
But I don't want

232
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,820
to be a sedan-driving official,

233
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,860
nor a factory doctor in a white coat.

234
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,460
So, what do you want to do?

235
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm afraid Fucheng

236
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,340
isn't big enough for my dreams.

237
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,380
Come, I'll take you somewhere.

238
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,660
Where to?

239
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,620
Let's go.

240
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,060
Slow down.

241
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,780
(Gongyuan)

242
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,820
Ding Dezhong's niece?

243
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,990
Is there anything good about her?

244
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,900
What do you call her?

245
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,900
Little Pouter.

246
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,540
Well, it's mainly

247
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
because she's just very pretty and sexy.

248
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,340
You like her, but does she like you?

249
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,140
Women look for three things.

250
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,500
Talent,

251
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,500
looks,

252
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,020
or money.

253
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,820
Look in the mirror,

254
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,580
and feel your pocket.

255
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,820
What do you have?

256
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,820
Dajiang,

257
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,780
what do you have then?

258
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,980
Can't you see?

259
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,700
I have all of them.

260
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,620
As for you,

261
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,580
you've lost

262
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,180
the first two.

263
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,580
But money...

264
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,020
If you want to make money in my place,

265
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,580
you need to have the knack for it.

266
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,340
Come on, where are we now?

267
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,540
Dajiang.

268
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

269
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,540
welcome to the New Century Grand Theater.

270
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,500
I am Fucheng's famous singer

271
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,100
for love songs, Lu Xiaolu.

272
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Today, I dedicate

273
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,940
my debut performance here

274
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,820
to the beautiful lady below,

275
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,940
Bai Lan.

How's that?

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,820
Good.

293
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,540
Aren't you afraid they'll kick us out?

294
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,980
You might not know

295
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,460
I'm a lifetime member of this theater.

296
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,300
The most brilliant moments of my life

297
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,460
both happened here.

298
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,820
- Really?
- Yes.

299
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,340
Tell me how brilliant they were.

300
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,820
The first time was
when I was in third grade.

301
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,180
My cousin and I were here

302
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,520
watching a movie, "Shaolin Temple".

303
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,400
The place was so packed,
and people were standing in the aisles.

304
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,900
While watching,

305
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,060
suddenly I noticed

306
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,240
smoke rising beside the screen,

307
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,740
and flames jumping.

308
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,140
I was the first to notice.

309
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
What happened next?

310
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,140
Then, my cousin and I

311
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,980
helped put out the fire
and evacuate the crowd.

312
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,390
Lucky, I spotted it early,

313
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,420
or it could have been too late

314
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,540
and killed someone.

315
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,740
Because of this, the school awarded me

316
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,460
a certificate for bravery.

317
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
This was the first award

318
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,860
I got in my life.

319
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,980
Seems your most brilliant times

320
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,100
were all when you were a child.

321
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,300
There were also times when I grew up.

322
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,030
In the second grade of junior high,

323
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,220
at that time,

324
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,420
I put shampoo

325
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,380
in our teacher's teapot.

326
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,590
As a result,

327
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,700
I was forced

328
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,220
to make a public apology here

329
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,980
during a school-wide movie session.

330
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,420
But that was because the teacher

331
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,500
was always picking on Li Guangnan

332
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,220
for being poor.

333
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,340
Hey, I'm telling you.

334
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,740
It was so funny.

335
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,180
While the teacher was scolding me,

336
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,780
he was also spitting out bubbles.

337
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,700
It was hilarious.

338
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,380
That sounds pretty interesting.

339
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,780
So, how did you make your apology?

340
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,140
At that time, I stood here

341
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,300
and recited a poem.

342
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,060
Over the vast sea,

343
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,340
where wild winds whip up the clouds,

344
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,820
between the clouds and the sea,

345
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,380
the petrel flies like dark lightning,

346
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,940
proudly soaring.

347
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,500
In its cries,

348
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,580
there's a longing for the storm.

349
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,820
In these cries,

350
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,780
the clouds hear the power of anger,

351
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,140
the flames of passion
and the confidence of victory.

352
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,500
The storm,

353
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,820
the storm is coming.

354
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,860
It's the brave petrel,

355
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,420
soaring proudly

356
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,700
over the roaring sea,

357
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,700

We could watch movies

376

yet you're drinking it?

Aren't you disgusted?

388
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
What a waste.

It's okay.

drink from this bottle.

really that popular lately?

407
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,820
Don't know.

you were the class beauty,

to talk or vent,

Just admit it's a love letter.

493
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,820
Only when writing love letters

494
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,260
does one get so serious and troubled.

495
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,140
It's okay if you don't admit it.

No.

499
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,940
Why be shy about it?

500
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,860
You like Xiaolu, and he likes you too.

501
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,020

Alright, I get it.

503
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,720
You're a college girl
with high standards.

504
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,180
Bi Zhigang is also pursuing you.

505
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,380
But our Xiaolu

506
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,460
is actually quite good.

507
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,980
Back in school, many girls pursued him.

508
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,500
He's a good guy.

509
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,860
It's not about him, it's about me.

510
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,580
Well,

511
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,260
what's wrong with you today?

512
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,140
Nothing. I'm going to freshen up.

513
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,460
Try this.

514
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,100
How is it?

515
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,940
The milk isn't fresh enough.

516
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,860
There's too much sugar.

517
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,060
And this tea.

518
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,030
Did you use flavoring additives
because they're cheaper?

519
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,940
You need to use fresh tea leaves.

520
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,740
If it's as bad as you say,

521
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,140
then why do people queue up for it?

522
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,660
That's because everyone's tired

523
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,060
of cola and Jianlibao.

524
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,820
They just want to try something new.

525
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,180
I have a good idea.

526
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Do you want to join me?

527
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,940
Tell us.

528
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,260
Since our tastes are superior

529
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,420
and our formula is unique,

530
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,780
why don't we set up a stall?

531
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,020
Look, Lu, you handle the recipe,

532
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,180
I'll manage the sales.

533
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,780
Big Feet is talented and versatile,

534
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,860
so he can draw in customers.

535
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,420
We could set up our stall
right at the entrance of the skating rink.

536
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,660
Dajiang is the big boss.

537
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,920
Once we start making money,
we can share the profits proportionally.

538
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,420
If we find an outlet,

539
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,260
we can
open a shop and mass produce,

540
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,590
and even expand throughout the city.

541
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,660
Li,

542
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,740
come here.

543
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,380
Take your temperature.

544
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,460
Are you feverish?

545
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
I'm not feverish.

546
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,660
This is the fire in my heart, Lu.

547
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
You're well off.

548
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,540
You have it all.

549
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,640
You can find a girlfriend easily.

550
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,100
But for people like me and Big Feet,

551
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,300
we have nothing.

552
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,740
I want to win over Little Pouter
and make her happy,

553
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,820
so my priority is to make money.

554
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
Alright.

555
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,220
Leave the recipe to me.

556
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,300
But let's get one thing straight.

557
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,140
We start with a trial stall.

558
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,820
We can't be successful overnight.

559
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,660
Well...

560
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,860
Don't worry about my cousin.

561
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,380
I'll convince him.

562
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,180
Thanks, bro.

563
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,420
Hey, hey, save it.

564
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,060
You've been fiddling
with that cassette all day.

565
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,380
Is it fixed yet?

566
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,740
Almost, almost.

567
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,620
Lu,

568
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,340
remind Dajiang.

569
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,540
Little Pouter passed a message,

570
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,060
saying Ding Dezhong might seek revenge

571
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,900
because of his son.

572
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,620
Dear Xiaolu,

573
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,620
I'm sorry.

574
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,660
Congratulations to me.

575
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,500
Does Xiaolu know?

576
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,380
I was just about to tell him.

577
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,420
Why are you suddenly going to Shanghai?

578
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,520
Aren't you afraid
Xiaolu will be heartbroken?

579
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,540
This is something
I've always wanted to do.

580
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,180
So,

581
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,020
after you finish
your sponsored postgraduate study,

582
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
will you come back?

583
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,060
I don't know.

584
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,380
You're being selfish.

585
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,900
Big Feet,

586
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,780
you're here alone?

587
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,640
You want to see Xiaolu, right?

588
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,740
He and Li Guangnan
are studying milk tea.

589
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,860
Milk tea?

590
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,500
Guangnan had a sudden inspiration,

591
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,100
thinking that the milk tea

592
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,500
Xiaolu gave you was especially delicious.

593
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,420
So,

594
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,100
he thought about making more

595
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,060
and then selling it.

596
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,030
Did you come here for something?

597
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,380
Nothing much.

598
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,420
What are you doing?

599
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,180
I'm working on a mobile milk tea cart.

600
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,740
Is this Xiaolu's table?

601
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,660
Yeah, that's right.

602
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,180
Then I'll be going.

603
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,380
When he comes back,

604
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,500
tell him to call me.

605
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,460
Sure.

606
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,980
- Bye.
- Bye.

607
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,740
Ding Dezhong wants to retaliate.

608
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,060
You go and make some inquiries.

609
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,730
- Who am I afraid of?
- That milk was really cheap.

610
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,940
Milk?

611
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,260
Wasn't it goat milk?

612
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,100
Milk.

613
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,260
- That's right.
- Here comes the milk!

614
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,620
So much.

615
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
How much did this cost?

616
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,700
Didn't cost a penny.

617
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,720
This was leftover
from the Cold Beverage Department.

618
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,410
The director said it would be a waste
to throw it away,

619
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,140
so he just gave it all to us.

620
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,300
Can such a good thing happen to us?

621
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,340
Do you know what this is called?

622
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,900
This is called perfect timing

623
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
and wealth flowing in.

624
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,380
Exactly.

625
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,460
- Try it.
- Here.

626
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,780
Hey, good.

627
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Let me have a try.

628
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,500

You can't put it in.

631
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,020
Right.

632
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,980
Bai Lan, your call!

633
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,260
Coming.

There was no problem at all.

637
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,020
Look what happened

638
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,990
after drinking your milk tea.

639
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,380
If you don't
give me an explanation today,

640
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,540
I...

641
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,580
Are you alright?

642
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,260
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

643
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,700
No, no. Hurry. Give me some tissues.

644
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,780
- Here it is, here.
- Here. Here.

645
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,620
Tissues. Tissues.

646
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,340
Xiaolu.

647
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,180
Bai Lan,

648
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,020
you're finally here.

649
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,580
I think it's food poisoning

650
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,460
caused by unclean food.

651
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,220
Distribute these medicines now.

652
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,140
- Is it serious?
- Just a lot of people.

653
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,860
Three pills each.

654
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,380
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I didn't drink it.

655
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,360
Get some cars

656
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,460
and get everyone to the infirmary.

657
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,220
Alright.

658
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,540
You're back.

659
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,380
How are you? Are you feeling any better?

660
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,820
I'm dying, Xiaolu.

661
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,900
If I really kick the bucket,

662
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,820
you'll have to look after my parents.

663
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,680
- What are you talking about?
- Get lost. What are you saying?

664
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,900
Dumb Jar, take him to the infirmary.

665
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,980
Hurry.

666
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,140
- Hey, take it easy.
- Everyone, hold on a bit.

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,920
- Come with me to the infirmary.
- Let's go to the infirmary.

668

Let's go.

669
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,580
Let's go.

670
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,260
Come on.

671
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,300

Thank you, Dr. Bai.

- You're welcome.
- Take it easy.

Finally done.

685
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,660
Tired?

686
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,220
Let me take you out for some food.

687
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,930
Don't you have something to say to me?

688
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,100
What is it?

689
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,740
Thank you

That's it.

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
What do you mean?

697
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,580
Where's your meal box?

699
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Where's the letter I gave you?

700
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,940
Letter?

701
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,580
You wrote me a letter?

Your heart's beating so fast.

709
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,260
You lied, right?

710
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,700
That's because I'm tired.

711
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,180
Everyone, wait a moment.

712
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,140
Let me say a few words.

713
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,940
The factory leadership is already aware

714
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,540
of the food poisoning incident last night.

715
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,700
Secretary Hong takes it very seriously

716
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,940
and is very concerned.

717
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,780
He decided to rush back
from out of town today.

718
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,500
Our Golden Peacock Food Factory

719
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,300
is a time-honored food enterprise.

720
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,140
Food hygiene and safety
are of utmost importance.

721
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,140
Such a serious, egregious,

722
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,820
and widely impacting incident

723
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,900
of food hygiene

724
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,180
in our public health facility

725
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,500
will not be tolerated or overlooked

726
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,980
by the factory leadership
and the Food Bureau.

727
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,060
We will definitely take strict actions

728
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,460
against these speculative profiteers.

729
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,500
These speculative profiteers...

730
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,340
Who are you calling speculative?

731
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,140
Li Guangnan,

732
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,540
did I name you?

733
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,260
Why are you rushing to confess?

734
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,260
You and Lu Xiaolu

735
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,620
will have to bear the consequences.

736
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,900
Neither of you can escape.

737
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,260
Alright,

738
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,220
since it has already happened,

739
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,380
please go home and rest well.

740
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,100
We will surely give everyone

741
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,940
a proper explanation.

742
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,020
Dismiss.

743
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,240
It's all my fault
for being greedy for a bargain,

744
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,900
insisting on using
that nearly expired milk.

745
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,780
We were too hasty.

746
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,900
But don't worry.

747
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,300
This started because of me.

748
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,420
I'll take full responsibility.

749
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,380
It won't affect you and Big Feet.

750
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,900
Uncle,

751
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,580
Li Guangnan has it tough.

752
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,340
Could you please...

753
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,540
Speak well of him

754
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,420
to Secretary Hong?

755
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,380
Why should I help him?

756
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,020
Let me ask you.

757
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,340
When they ganged up

758
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,100
to send your cousin
to the mental institution,

759
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,180
who helped me?

760
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,620
What were you doing then?

761
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,500
Why didn't you stand up

762
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,740
for your cousin?

763
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,020
He did this for me.

764
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,940
If we're really to blame,

765
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm also responsible.

766
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,140
I know he's pursuing you,

767
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,780
but is he worthy of you?

768
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,700
Don't degrade yourself

769
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,820
by crawling into a rat's nest.

770
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,660
Tell him to be here.

771
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,300
I'll talk to him face-to-face.

772
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,100
Alright.

773
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,620
Xiaoying.

774
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,580
Wait a moment.

775
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,300
How prestigious Lu Xiaolu is!

776
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,460
He has never returned it himself.

777
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,540
Something happened
at the skating rink last night.

778
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,860
He was busy all night without rest.

779
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Is he alright?

780
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,940
He should be fine.

781
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,140
Then I should serve him more.

782
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,500
How was the braised pork ribs last time?

783
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,900
They were especially delicious.

784
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,820
Especially delicious.

785
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,660
He said they were especially delicious.

786
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,460
You didn't sneak a taste, did you?

787
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
No, no, no.

788
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,420
I... I just smelled it

789
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,700
when he was eating,

790
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,060
and then felt it was especially delicious.

791
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,940
Alright then. Wait there,

792
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,820
I'll get it ready for you.

793
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,980
(Factory Workers are Like Family,
Love the Factory Like Home)

794
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,820
How is it?

795
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,020
What's this?

796
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,180
You got it wrong.

797
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,780
My milk tea is sold
at the entrance of the skating rink.

798
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,580
But what does this
have to do with Dajiang?

799
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,820
He just lent me a place.

800
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,660
Li Guangnan,

801
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,620
don't rush to play the hero.

802
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,860
You're a smart person.

803
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,740
You should know

804
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,780
this isn't just about selling milk tea.

805
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,460
I understand.

806
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,460
You're trying to take revenge, huh?

807
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,900
Revenge?

808
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,120
I'm just seeking justice
that's rightfully mine.

809
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,980
Ding Dezhong, I'm telling you.

810
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,620
You've asked the wrong person.

811
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,980
I can't betray my friends.

812
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,380
Does Lu Dajiang
even consider you a friend?

813
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,620
He only cares

814
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,340
about his cousin, Lu Xiaolu.

815
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,100
Lu Xiaolu is my brother.

816
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,940
You...

817
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,700
You, Lu Xiaolu, and our Juan

818
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,940
have been old classmates
and friends for years.

819
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,940
But do you know

820
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,980
why I only asked you to be here,

821
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,020
instead of Lu Xiaolu?

822
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,100
Because Juan asked me to help you.

823
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,860
To help you, not Lu Xiaolu.

824
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,190
Really?

825
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,940
Let me tell you the truth.

826
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,980
This matter has blown up.

827
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,580
The Health Bureau
has informed the police.

828
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,660
The police called the factory management,

829
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,340
saying this was
an illegal unlicensed operation

830
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,860
and a serious
poisoning incident occurred.

831
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,260
If they really investigate,

832
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,060
a few years in jail
wouldn't be surprising.

833
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,860
I know the situation at your home.

834
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,740
What will happen to your family

835
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,700
if you end up in jail?

836
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,100
Can your father still see his doctor?

837
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,260
Will your mother survive?

838
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,900
I know

839
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,340
you've been pursuing Juan
for many years,

840
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,260
but even if she says yes,

841
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,420
do you think I'd let her

842
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,900
marry someone who has nothing?

843
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,580
Would I?

844
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,140
It's all been investigated.

845
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,770
The ingredients
that caused the food poisoning

846
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,340
came from the Cold Beverage Department.

847
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,380
Director He from the department admitted

848
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,030
that he took a pack of cigarettes
from Li Guangnan

849
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,260
and then gave him

850
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,400
the two leftover buckets of milk.

851
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,260
Isn't this undermining socialism?

852
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,220
Meticulous inspection day and night

853
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,730
is not enough
to protect us from an inside job.

854
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,040
According to factory rules,

855
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,460
how should this be dealt with?

856
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,340
Per our disciplinary regulations,

857
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,140
Li Guangnan will be dismissed,

858
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,400
and Director He will receive a demerit
and have his salary suspended.

859
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,140
Good.

860
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,260
Proceed with the factory rules.

861
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,140
Handle it seriously

862
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,340
without leniency.

863
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,580
Listen.

864
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,860
Secretary Hong was furious

865
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,500
over this incident.

866
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,810
Mr. Ding, I beg you.

867
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,660
Please don't fire me.

868
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,500
My mom will kill me.

869
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
I beg you.

870
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,340
Get up.

871
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,140
Li,

872
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,860
I want to help you,

873
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,580
but the situation has developed

874
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,540
to this point.

875
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,260
Someone must bear the consequences.

876
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,180
If I don't fire you, who should I fire?

877
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,180
- I beg...
- Get up.

878
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,660
Some consequences

879
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,380
are not yours to bear.

880
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,340
Even if Lu Dajiang
loses the skating rink,

881
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,860
he can still thrive.

882
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,260
But can you?

883
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,300
You can't, kid.

884
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,900
What about Xiaolu?

885
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,220
He's innocent in this matter.

886
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,380
As long as Lu Dajiang leaves the factory,

887
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,420
we'll call it even

888
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,900
and won't involve anyone else.

889
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,220
You can be assured of that.

890
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,660
Sit.

891
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,300
I'm telling you all this

892
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,940
for my niece's sake.

893
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,820
Do you understand?

894
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,940
So, it was Lu Dajiang
who told you to do this,

895
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,940
right?

896
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,060
If there are no other issues,

897
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,540
just sign here.

898
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,620
(Confession Letter: Instructed by Lu Dajiang,
I illicitly used expired and spoiled milk...)

899
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:31,140
(Informant: Li Guangnan)

900
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,060
Isn't this better?

901
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,860
Okay.

902
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,220
If there's nothing else,

903
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,580
you can go.

904
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,700
You...

905
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,180
What are you doing, meditating?

906
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,540
Didn't you already say goodbye?

907
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,760
Why are you still not leaving?

908
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,220
Where's the letter?

909
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,700
It irritated me,

910
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,660
so I burned it.

911
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,620
What right do you have
to burn my things?

912
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,020
Fine then.

913
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,940
I didn't burn it.

914
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,060
- So, where's the letter?
- Burned it.

915
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,890
- You just said you didn't burn it.
- Didn't burn it.

916
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,480
- Did you burn it or not?
- Didn't burn it.

917
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,500
Burned it or not? Burned it or not?

918
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,340
Niu Xiaoying!

919
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,860
Bai Lan!

920
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,020
You think you can outshout me?

921
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,580
Can you?

922
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,860
I can't.

923
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,980
Alright then.

924
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,900
How did the letter end up with you?

925
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,860
Who told you to put the letter
in Lu Xiaolu's meal box?

926
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,180
I prepare

927
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,940
his meals every day.

928
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,780
Let it be burned then.

929
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,500
Maybe it's better that way.

930
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,240
Do you really not want it anymore?

931
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,420
Didn't you say it was burned?

932
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,420
You...

933
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,460
Gets me mad.

934
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,820
(Golden Peacock)

935
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,460
Attention, all factory workers.

936
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,660
This food poisoning incident

937
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,620
has caused serious consequences

938
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,860
and negative impacts.

939
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,580
After deliberation
by the Factory Affairs Council,

940
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,460
it has been decided
to shut down the skating rink immediately

941
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,940
and revoke the business license

942
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,420
of Lu Dajiang's Skate Land.

943
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,700
This incident reminds us

944
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,900
that Golden Peacock,

945
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,980
as a leader in the city's food industry,

946
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,380
- always puts a priority
- Don't run.

947
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,100
on health and safety in our work.

948
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,460
Bai Lan,

949
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,860
where are you going?

950
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,620
I'm thinking of walking by the river.

951
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,340
I'm going to see my cousin.

952
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,300
Let's walk together.

953
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,660
Sure.

954
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,100
Do you ever think

955
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,140
that I'm a very selfish person?

956
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,580
Didn't I already answer

957
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,260
this question for you?

958
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,460
Then maybe you don't really
know me at all.

959
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,040
Didn't you say
we were like two peas in a pod?

960
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,540
Since we are so alike,

961
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,620
shouldn't I understand you
as well as I understand myself?

962
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,580
Xiaolu,

963
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,780
I have something to tell you.

964
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,500
What is it?

965
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,300
I actually got...

966
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,260
Bai Lan!

967
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,940
- Bai Lan!
- Tian?

968
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,860
I've finally found you.

969
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,260
Please

970
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,340
cover my shift tonight.

971
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,380
Shift?

972
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,140
Bi Zhigang just called,

973
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,380
saying we absolutely need someone

974
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,480
on duty at the infirmary tonight.

975
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,780
But today,

976
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,660
it's my wife's birthday

977
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,980
and she really wants me to a movie.

978
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,020
If I don't go,

979
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,220
she'll threaten to divorce me.

980
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,340
You...

981
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,540
Alright, don't worry.

982
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,380
I'll cover your shift.

983
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,780
Happy birthday to your loved one.

984
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,620
Thank you.

985
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,100
Oh no, it's going to rain.

986
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,620
- I better hurry.
- Okay.

987
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,300
- Stay safe.
- Sure thing.

988
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,760
What are you thinking about?

989
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,740
Bi Zhigang said someone
needs to stay at the infirmary.

990
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,260
Has this ever happened before?

991
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,540
Before?

992
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,540
I don't recall it ever happening.

993
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,620
Could he know something

994
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,530
is going to happen tonight?

995
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,100
Remind Dajiang.

996
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,020
Ding Dezhong might seek revenge

997
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,060
for his son.

998
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:28,890
Oh no.

999
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,310
Ding Dezhong wouldn't go
after my cousin, would he?
