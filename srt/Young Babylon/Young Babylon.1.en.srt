I haven't gotten married yet!

Why all this noise?
People are trying to sleep here!

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,130
It was scary!

00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,710
I was having a nice dream,

35
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,750
playing basketball with Joey Wong.

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,710
Forget about that Joey Wong.

37
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,250
You have
the college entrance exam to take.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,310
Get up, get up, get up!

39
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,430
Okay, okay, I got it.

40
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,270
Get up quickly.

41
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,430
Come on, eat.

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,970
These are top-notch goods exported
to Southeast Asia by the food factory.

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,590
Your mom got them with a pressure cooker

45
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,060
to feed your brain.

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,780
We've been eating them
for three days straight

47
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,340
and I'm tired of them already.

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,690
You picky brat.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,910
We are saving it for you.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,150

52

Give it to your son.

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,560
Come on, a big piece.

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
- To feed your brain.
- Eat it.

55
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,950

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,240

57
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,500
and hurry home.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,030
I heard there is a pervert out there.

59
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,210
I can't rest easy with you

60
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,330
going home alone at night.

61
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,690
Why should a boy be afraid of a pervert?

62
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,450
Look at his long hair.

63
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,520
What if the pervert

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,770
mistakes him for a girl?

65
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,940
It's my fault, really.

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,250
I looked too delicate when I was young.

67
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,690
What's with that expression?

68
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,280
What are you trying to say?

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,710
Are you saying our son takes after you?

70
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,440
Yes, exactly. He looks just like
a mirror image of me.

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,840
He looks like me, okay?

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah, he looks like you.

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,560
Our son is so handsome and delicate

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,840
- because I'm pretty.
- You are right.

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
He is...

76
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,160
Hey, Lu Xiaolu,

77
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,740
why are you taking the recorder?

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,320
Today is the last day
of the college entrance exam.

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,200
The head teacher said

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,270
we'll have a party

81
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,110
after it's over.

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,560
I just told you

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,150
to come straight home.

84
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,030
Why do you want to celebrate?

85
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,660
What if you mess up the exam?

86
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,660
He won't. He won't.

87
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,890
This teacher's suggestion is good.

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,760
That kid from the chemical factory

89
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,690
didn't do well in the exam
and jumped off a building.

90
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,770
What are you saying?

91
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,370
Don't worry,

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,910
I definitely won't do that.

93
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,150
Go get the oral solution.

94
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,450
- Okay, okay.
- Let me tell you,

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,740
the teacher personally told me that

96
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,300
you are smart enough

97
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,330
for college.

98
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,250
My son won't mess up the exam, right?

99
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,680
Mom, I think you misunderstood.

100
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,550
Huh?

101
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,880
I meant, even if I do mess up,

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,590
I definitely won't jump off a building.

103
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,250
- You little rascal.
- I'm leaving.

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Hey!

105
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Lu Xiaolu,

106
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,790
check your paper a few more times
before handing it in.

107
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,910
You must be home by six o'clock tonight.

108
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,790
Watch out for that pervert.

109
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,450
Don't worry,

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,030
if I run into that pervert,
I'll smash his head.

111
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,450
Oh, stop bragging.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,640
=Episode 1: Young People at the Food Factory=
Go for it, son!

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,620
- Bye.
- I'll wait for your good news.

114
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,250
Stay safe.

115
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,540

Attention, all factory workers,

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,740
urgent notice.

In the early hours of today,

118
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,840
(Gongyuan)
after a female worker finished her night shift,

119
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,180
(Strive for a Miracle)
she met a pervert in the residential area.

120
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,060
According to the victim's report,

121
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,620
this pervert is of medium build,

122
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,570
wearing a raincoat,

123
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,300
and behaving inappropriately.

124
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,000
If you have any information,

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,890
please contact
the factory security department.

126
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,910
- Li Guangnan.
- Yeah?

127
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm really a good friend, huh?

128
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,450
I came right before the exam
to help you pursue the girl.

129
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,350
You could have chosen any day to confess,

130
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,440
but you insisted on doing it today.

131
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,640
I must be the first person in the world

132
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,540
to wish her a happy birthday.

133
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,270
Okay, but let's set it straight.

134
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,210
If she doesn't show up

135
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,200
within ten minutes,
I have to go for the exam.

136
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,010
Alright, alright, ten minutes it is.

137
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,370
Here, take this.
Good luck with your exam.

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
Thank you.

139
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
Oh, by the way,

140
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,950
this is for you.

141
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,750

Little Pouter.

Li Guangnan, why are you here?

144

Happy birthday to you!

145

I've been preparing for a year.

146
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,760
Look, I know you like Chen Haonan.

147
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,130
I bought you all his magazines.

148
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,460
And remember how you liked

149
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,880
those little cards about the Sailor Moon

150
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,910
in the instant noodles?

151
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,030
I collected them all for you.

152
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,870
How about that?

153
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,840
These are things I liked

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,760
back in middle school.

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,740
I've moved on long ago.

156
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,620
Morning, Uncle Li.

157
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,230
Nice dance, Uncle Li.

158
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,690
- Yeah.
- Don't hurt your back.

159
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,740
Even if you don't like them,

160
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,540
I got some music for you.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,810
Two tapes, played the wrong one.

162
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,890
Are you crazy?

163
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,180
What if my bosses see this?

164
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,100
Hey, wait, Little Pouter.

165
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,110
The moment I first saw you

166
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,910
in middle school, I liked you.

167
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,470
I still like you after six years.

168
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,620
But I don't like you.

169
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,630
No, hey!

170
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,110
Li Guangnan came on the day
of college entrance exam

171
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,770
just to wish you a happy birthday.

172
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,980
Even if you don't accept it,

173
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,500
can't you be a bit more polite?

174
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,770
What does it have to do with you,
Lu Xiaolu?

175
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,540
You used to be lovely.

176
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
Why have you become so rude

177
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,010
after a few years?

178
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,860
None of your business. Move aside.

179
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,370
Hey, Little Pouter.

180
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,070
I really...

181
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,960
- Hey!
- Where are the hooligans?

182
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,300
Dakang, these two.

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,680
Are you crazy?
You came to our factory gate

184
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,540
to harass the most beautiful girl
in our factory?

185
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,930
I'll teach you two a lesson today.

186
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,470
- What's going on? You've misunderstood.
- Get them!

187
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,420
- Little Pouter, say something.
- Let go!

188
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,160
Let go!

189
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,120
We're not hooligans.

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
Let's talk

191
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,540
in the security office.

192
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,870
We have to take the college entrance exam.

193
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,330
We can't go with you to the security office.

194
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,040
We need to hurry.

195
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,470
The mayor invited me to a meeting later.

196
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,310
Move!

197
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,690
- Let go!
- You don't know who his cousin is?

198
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,800
Who is he?

199
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,640
Let go.

200
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,260
His cousin is the undefeated Lu Dajiang,
Scarface Lu along the Min River.

201
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,950
Let go.

202
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,880
You are scared, huh?

203
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,570
Lu Dajiang? I know him.

204
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,210
He is just a stinky thug.

205
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,590
He's a big thug.

206
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,560
You two are little thugs.

207
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,400
How dare you hit me!

208
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,740
(No Parking)

209
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,820
(Gongyuan)

210
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,530
♪You entered my world♪

211
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,320
♪And everything of mine
began to spiral out of control♪

212
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,660
Li Guangnan, run!

213
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,850
(People say)

214
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,690
(real life starts)

215
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,970
(from the moment of awakening.)

216
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,970
(When I was 19,)

217
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,260
(I always wanted to conquer the world,)

218
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,200
(just like how)

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,660
(it wanted to conquer me.)

220
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,570
(On that morning)

221
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,260
(when colorful clothes flew in the air,)

222
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,060
(she walked towards me)

223
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,940
(and the world fell silent.)

224
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,590
(I knew)

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,300
(our story)

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,900
(started)

227
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,140
(from here.)

228
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,180
(Golden Peacock)

229
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
(Gongyuan)
Lift your heads up!

230
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,530
(Chief Ma, Security Department)
Lu Xiaolu, the future college student.

231
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,000
Uncle Ma.

232
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,110
You're about to become a college student,

233
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,420
yet you still hang out all day
like a street punk.

234
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,460
Li Guangnan.

235
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,930
- Yeah?
- Don't give me that.

236
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,860
Turn around.

237
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,940
When I first joined the factory,

238
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,040
the two of you

239
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,460
were still running around
in open-crotch pants.

240
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,780
Now you've got the guts

241
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,060
to fight at the factory gate. I...

242
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,980
Uncle Ma,

243
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,260
save the lecture for another day.

244
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,980
We're about to take the exam today.

245
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,460
Why didn't you think that
before you fought?

246
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,820
Uncle Ma, if he doesn't take the exam,
his parents will kill him.

247
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you think of

248
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,660
your parents when you were fighting?

249
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,900
- I...
- Okay, that's enough.

250
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,860
Ma.

251
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,500
Raise your heads.

252
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,500
Who threw the first punch?

253
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,340
They did!

254
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,180
Hey, you...

255
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,980
What's your name?

256
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,620
Qin Juan.

257
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,300
Wu, she is a clerk in our labor
and management office.

258
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,980
Tell us,

259
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,860
who started the fight?

260
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,220
I... I didn't see anything.

261
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Hey, Little Pouter.

262
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,620
- I...
- Alright,

263
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,380
you're not involved here.

264
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,700
You can go.

265
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,940
She can't leave.

266
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,980
She's a witness.

267
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,060
Shut up!

268
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,060
You're the new factory doctor?

269
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,660
Yes.

270
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,920
(First Love)
Did you see who threw the first punch?

271
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,940
I did.

272
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,820
Ma.

273
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,060
Oh, Bi.

274
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,300
I heard there was trouble here.

275
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,100
There's not much going on here.

276
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,100
Let me introduce you.

277
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,380
This is Officer Wu
from the police station.

278
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,660
Nice to meet you.

279
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,580
Wu, this is Bi Zhigang from

280
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,420
the secretary's office.

281
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,960
(Bi Zhigang, Factory Secretary)
Come have tea with me sometime.

282
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,340
So, what's the situation?

283
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,300
We're interrogating,

284
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
but they all deny
throwing the first punch.

285
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,900
We hold disciplinary

286
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,660
and ideological education sessions
every month.

287
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Our workers are civilized and rule-abiding.

288
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,740
They wouldn't

289
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,820
start fights, right?

290
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,420
That's right.

291
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,860
You are Lu Dajiang's cousin, right?

292
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,900
Your cousin used to dominate Fucheng.

293
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,700
How come you're so worthless?

294
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,620
Getting beaten down like this.

295
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
Hey, Bi...

296
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,340
- What are you doing?
- I may not have my brother's power,

297
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,660
but I can swat flies,

298
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,540
especially annoying ones like you.

299
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,940
- I...
- Dude,

300
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,630
haven't washed your hair in years, huh?

301
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,020
Your mousse is probably stinking.

302
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,540
Look, it must have been him
who threw the first punch.

303
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,470
Arrest him! It's definitely him.

304
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,220
- It must be him!
- Alright!

305
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,260
Calm down.

306
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,100
(Security Department)

307
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,300
- Captain Wu.
- Get down.

308
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,940
She said she saw
who threw the first punch.

309
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,500
Who was it?

310
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,820
- Him.
- I told you!

311
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,300
Dong, take him with us.

312
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,460
Everyone else can go.

313
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,060
- Let's go.
- Have a good day.

314
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,020
You've got the wrong person.

315
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,220
Shut up!

316
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,260
None of your business!

317
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,740
Get lost!

318
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,980
This is not over.

319
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,460
Of course it is not,

320
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,060
you owe me a suitcase.

321
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,580
Xiaolu,

322
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,090
I think you can still make it to the exam.

323
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,540
There's a shortcut
by the vegetable market.

324
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,780
Hurry on your bike, you can get there.

325
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,660
- Just go.
- Thanks, Uncle Wu.

326
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,300
- I'm going.
- Good luck!

327
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,780
Strive to become a college student.

328
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,020
- Don't be like your cousin.
- Okay.

329
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,220
That's it?

330
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,900
We've taken him out of the factory.

331
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,460
Will you buy him lunch if we keep him?

332
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,060
Let's go back.

333
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,580
Honey,

334
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,780
when did you start believing in this?

335
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Li Guangnan's mother taught me this.

336
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,580
She said the students would be blessed.

337
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,140
Didn't you say that

338
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,820
our son is naturally bright,

339
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,740
born to excel in academics?

340
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
I didn't tell the truth

341
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,980
in front of him just now.

342
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,820
Actually, the teachers said,

343
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,300
"Your son, Lu Xiaolu,

344
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,340
is intelligent enough

345
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,740
for college,

346
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,140
but he's mischievous and doesn't study hard.

347
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,460
It's difficult for him to even get
into the top ten in the class."

348
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,680
Mischievous and lazy,

349
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,060
yet he can still make it into the top ten.

350
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,180
What kind of intelligence is this?

351
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,600
Whose intelligence did he get?

352
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,780
Apparently yours, isn't it?

353
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,140
Not at all.

354
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,860
When I was a student,

355
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I was always in the top three of the class.

356
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,940
I was good-looking,

357
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,300
and my grades were decent.

358
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,420
Every teacher liked me.

359
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,780
- Let me tell you.
- What?

360
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,900
Many people

361
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,660
in our factory ask for

362
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,580
a celebratory banquet when they see me.

363
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,380
I've booked a restaurant.

364
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,340
If this brat doesn't do well,

365
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,940
what will we do?

366
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,420
He'll definitely do well.

367
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,460
No problem.

368
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,260
(Brave the waves, pass with flying colors)

369
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,860
Sir, please don't lock the door.

370
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,820
Let me in.

371
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,540
Stop yelling.
They're taking exams inside.

372
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,700
I'm here to take the exam too.

373
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,940
- Let me in.
- I can't.

374
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,620
Mr. Zhang!

375
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,820
Mr. Zhang!

376
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,820
Please don't shout.

377
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,020
Mr. Hu!

378
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,060
Please let me in!

379
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,460
- I'm Xiaolu!
- Young man,

380
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,980
if you shout again, I'll call the police.

381
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,780
Please, sir, please let me in.

382
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,540
Why are you also outside?

383
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,540
We were both in the fight this morning,

384
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,300
how can I go in alone?

385
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,940
My brother.

386
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,700
Take this.

387
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
(Parents, please keep out)

388
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,500
How will you explain

389
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,980
to your mom tonight?

390
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,540
Explain?

391
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,860
Dare I say anything?

392
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,780
The problem is,

393
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,820
even if I go to take the exam,

394
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,100
I might not pass.

395
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,740
But you could

396
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,340
at least pass a vocational school.

397
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,500
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,780
It's all because of me.

399
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,860
No big deal.

400
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,500
It's just the college entrance exam.

401
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,740
With my intelligence and talent,

402
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,300
even if I don't go to college,

403
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,460
I can do anything.

404
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,620
Maybe we can work in a factory.

405
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,180
In a factory?

406
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,020
Yeah.

407
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,060
Working in a factory is honorable,

408
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,900
especially if you can

409
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,980
get into that food factory.

410
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,540
Not only is the welfare good,

411
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,300
with endless bread and soda every month,

412
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,020
but more importantly, it's the factory
with the most girls in the city.

413
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,260
Little Pouter works there too.

414
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,540
Let's focus on surviving tonight now.

415
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
Alright,

416
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
stop sulking. It's no use.

417
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,820
Come with me

418
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,620
to find my cousin.

419
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,500
My mom's waiting for me at home.

420
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,100
It's too early to go back and meet death.

421
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,380
Early death, early reincarnation.

422
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,780
The basketball court renovation project

423
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,540
(Welcome to Golden Peacock)
can't be taken by Lu Dajiang,

424
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,580
do you understand?

425
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,820
Although he used to be
a worker in our factory,

426
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,580
he committed some bad deeds

427
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,820
and ran off to Hong Kong.

428
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,100
Now he's a

429
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,940
complete troublemaker.

430
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,860
So what if he has money?

431
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,060
We don't associate with such social scum.

432
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,500
Anyway, don't give him the project.

433
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,260
Just do as I say.

434
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,860
He can talk to me at the factory!

435
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,020
He's on his way?

436
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,660
(Lu Dajiang, Domineering Man of Fucheng)

437
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,020
Why didn't you say this earlier?

438
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,780
Director,

439
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,980
this is Bai Lan,

440
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,500
our new factory doctor.

441
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,980
I just graduated from university,

442
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,380
and I brought her to meet with you.

443
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,900
You...

444
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,500
You are...

445
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,900
Where is my cousin?

446
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,860
Who's your cousin?

447
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,900
Cut the crap!

448
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,580
Someone told me you had him arrested.

449
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,300
That's right,

450
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,820
he openly harassed
one of our factory workers

451
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,300
and got involved in a fight.

452
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,100
The evidence is clear,

453
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,820
and the witness is right here.

454
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,100
He was just taken away by the police.

455
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,460
Good for you, Bi Zhigang,

456
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,260
now you're acting all dignified

457
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,220
and you dare to touch my cousin.

458
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,060
I...

459
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,420
Don't forget

460
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,340
how you begged me

461
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,180
when I beat you up back then.

462
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,740
I was a student cadre.

463
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,300
I couldn't stoop to your level.

464
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,140
You...

465
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,020
Hey, you...

466
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
What are you doing?
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

467
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,540
You're the witness?

468
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
What did you see?

469
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,060
I don't know if your cousin
harassed the female worker,

470
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,900
but he did hit someone

471
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,740
and damaged my suitcase.

472
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,580
That's right.

473
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,260
I'll pay you double for the suitcase.

474
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,940
Call the police now

475
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,300
and tell them he didn't hit anyone.

476
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,900
Get him released right now.

477
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,780
Lu Dajiang, stop messing around here!

478
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,460
Just shut up.

479
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,900
- Hey, you...
- He hit someone. That's the truth.

480
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,340
I can't lie to the police.

481
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,700
That's right.

482
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,380
Pig Teeth,

483
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,220
Dumb Jar,

484
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,700
close the door.

485
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,020
- You...
- What are you doing?

486
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,340
You... You...

487
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,060
- What do you want?
- In broad daylight, this is...

488
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,540
- Stop making trouble!
- What do you want?

489
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,820
If they don't release him today,

490
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,980
no one will leave.

491
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,340
- Wait.
- Listen,

492
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,820
your logic is flawed.

493
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,540
He's not even here.

494
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,180
If you have the guts,
go to the police and ask for him.

495
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,140
That's right.

496
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,580
If you have the guts, go ahead.

497
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,100
You are talking about logic?

498
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,940
I may only have
a middle school education,

499
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,180
but I understand logic.

500
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,700
You framed him,

501
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,780
so the police arrested him.

502
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,660
Change your tune,

503
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,420
and they'll release him,

504
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,980
right?

505
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,380
This is not logic at all.

506
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,460
This is unreasonable.

507
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,020
Let me tell you,

508
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,260
this is the factory director's office,

509
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
not where you can act wild.

510
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,300
- Get out of here.
- Hit him!

511
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,900
Don't do that!

512
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,340
Why are you doing this?

513
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,580
Call the police now.

514
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,300
Let him go. You let go first.

515
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,500
Let go, it's dangerous.

516
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,380
- Make the call, will you?
- You...

517
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,820
- Fine, I'll make a call.
- Do it now.

518
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,660
Stop wasting time.

519
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,300
Police officer?

520
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,860
- Dajiang!
- Boss!

521
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,700
Oh dear.

522
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,340
She hit him hard.

523
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,340
You... You guys...

524
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,620
Stop messing around.

525
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,540
Are you okay?

526
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,940
No... No...

527
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,620
Boss.

528
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,980
Quickly release him.

529
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,940
If you don't,

530
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,540
just wait and see.

531
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,980
Let's go.

532
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Pig Teeth, open the door.

533
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,780
This

534
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,060
is not over!

535
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,340
You should go to the hospital

536
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,860
in case of a concussion.

537
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,700
They're gone. They're gone.

538
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,020
No need to come here.

539
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,660
Hit him! Hit him!

540
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,460
Hit him!

541
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,620
Punch him! Punch!

542
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,180
Take it easy.

543
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,220
Boss, are you okay?

544
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,280
(A Better Tomorrow)
Boss Ma,

545
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,140
please protect my big brother
and keep him safe.

546
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,260
What happened to him?

547
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,580
He was...

548
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,580
He was attacked by a woman.

549
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,260
That crazy woman!

550
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,660
Who is she?

551
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,060
She wore a blue floral dress,

552
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,180
white shirt,

553
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,820
big eyes,

554
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,900
quite pretty,

555
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,140
but she's too vicious.

556
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,420
Dajiang was fine when he was there,

557
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,840
but once he came out,
he was in bad shape.

558
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,180
Blue floral dress, white shirt...

559
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,100
- Dajiang.
- Boss.

560
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,180
- Dajiang.
- Be careful. Slowly.

561
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,020
Are you okay?

562
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,700
Why am I here?

563
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,740
Your head

564
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,620
just got hit at the food factory.

565
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
You should rest a bit more.

566
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,140
It's okay, it's okay.

567
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,020
I remember now.

568
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,700
Lu Xiaolu?

569
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,300
You came out so quickly.

570
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,180
It was her.

571
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,700
She's the one who attacked Dajiang.

572
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,140
It's really you.

573
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,680
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

574
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,220
You hit me

575
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,980
and then want me to go to hospital.

576
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Why are you treating me so well?

577
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,220
If there really was a concussion,

578
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,380
there would be consequences.

579
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,580
I let my guard down today,

580
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,940
but I never hit women.

581
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
I won't pursue this matter with you.

582
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
Stop bothering me.

583
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,300
Get out of here.

584
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,700
Leave now.

585
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,300
Leave right now.

586
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,300
We'll settle this with a game of snooker.

587
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,740
If you win, I'll go with you.

588
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,460
If you lose, get lost.

589
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,900
Nice shot.

590
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,780
You've got some skills.

591
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,700
Do you college girls often play this?

592
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I played for two years
with my foreign teacher

593
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,260
to learn English in university.

594
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,260
My cousin just got injured

595
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,340
and is not feeling well.

596
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,900
I'll play for him.

597
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,980
Whatever.

598
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,660
The power is out.

599
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,780
Who's cooking again?

600
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,420
The fuse

601
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,580
is blown again.

602
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,860
Do what we always do.

603
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,220
- Good shot.
- Nice.

604
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,620
Amazing!

605
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,220
(Lu Dajiang)

606
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,980
Mom? What are you doing here?

607
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,260
What are you doing?

608
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,820
You skipped the exam

609
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,060
and came here to play billard?

610
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Mom, please calm down.

611
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
Listen to my explanation.

612
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,580
What explanation?

613
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,340
Dajiang! Help!

614
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,780
Stop! Little brat!

615
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,380
Mom, I'll explain when I get home.

616
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,700
Lu Xiaolu,

617
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,820
stop right there.

618
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,220
Where are you going?

619
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
Lu Xiaolu!

620
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,260
You can't leave.

621
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
You lost to me.

622
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,580
Xiaolu!

623
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,660
Hop on.

624
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,860
Mom, stop chasing.

625
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,980
(Dajiang Entertainment)
Where are you going?

626
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,980
Come back here!

627
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,700
You failed the college entrance exam

628
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,700
and your parents won't let you off.

629
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,140
What will you do next?

630
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,780
Dajiang,

631
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,140
what were you doing

632
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
at 18?

633
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,540
Me?

634
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,180
I got expelled from middle school.

635
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,180
When I was 18,

636
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,540
I was fighting,

637
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,540
chasing girls, and selling cigarettes.

638
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,300
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

639
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Because

640
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,140
I want to be like you.

641
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,220
What do you mean like me?

642
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,540
I mean as tough as you.

643
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,020
You do whatever you want

644
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,460
and protect whoever you want

645
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,780
just like Boss Ma.

646
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,140
You should study hard.

647
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,500
You failed this year,

648
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,580
but you can do another year.

649
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,340
Today,

650
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,460
there was a moment

651
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,260
when I felt like my life was doomed.

652
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,940
I didn't know what to do next

653
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,940
or how to

654
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,100
face my mom and others.

655
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,580
But now,

656
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,180
I've figured it out.

657
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,780
Since fate made me
miss the college entrance exam,

658
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,380
why not venture out?

659
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,300
Heroes have no fixed origins.

660
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,300
Maybe you can work in the food factory,

661
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,420
you may achieve something there.

662
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,940
Why must I enter a factory?

663
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,780
You don't want me to work for you?

664
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,700
Are you looking down on me?

665
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,740
Life isn't a movie.

666
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,660
It's much harder than that.

667
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,140
You'll understand in the future.

668
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,660
Dajiang.

669
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,380
What

670
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,380
would Boss Ma do

671
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,060
in this situation?

672
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,260
I don't know.

673
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,700
But whether he chooses right or wrong,

674
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,980
he'll definitely rise again.

675
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,900
(A month later)

676
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,500
In the hot summer air

677
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,140
when everything

678
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,420
is flourishing,

679
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,500
our factory welcomes...

680
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,060
Secretary Zhao. Secretary Zhao.

681
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,740
Mrs. Li.

682
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,260
I've chased you for a while.

683
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,700
I didn't see you.

684
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,060
Thank you so much.

685
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,140
What for?

686
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,180
It's all thanks to you that

687
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,860
my son Guangnan entered the factory

688
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,300
together with your son Xiaolu.

689
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,260
I'll bring two bottles of good liquor
for Mr. Lu tonight.

690
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
We've been friends

691
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,300
for so many years.

692
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,540
Why all the formality between us?

693
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,420
We should thank you anyway.

694
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,990
He couldn't have gotten in
without your help.

695
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,100
- Next up, please welcome
- Oh, come on.

696
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,340
- the representative of the young workers,
- Let's go.

697
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,580
Comrade Lu Xiaolu,

698
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,220
to address everyone.

699
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
It's Xiaolu.

700
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,140
Who asked him to speak?

701
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,620
What right does he have to speak?

702
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,020
Because he's talented.

703
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,100
- Just listen.
- Not at all.

704
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,380
Respected leaders and seniors,

705
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm Lu Xiaolu.

706
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,940
Due to failing the college entrance exam,

707
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,740
I lost the opportunity for higher education.

708
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,180
I felt lost and

709
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,100
desperate in life.

710
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,580
I let my teachers,

711
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,860
classmates,

712
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,020
and my parents down.

713
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,060
Can you be serious?

714
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,700
Speak properly. I might be punished.

715
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,900
You called me here

716
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,740
and then blame me?

717
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,700
At this time,

718
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,580
my mom opened the Xinhua Dictionary

719
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,540
for me to read a passage.

720
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,740
Zhang Hua got into Peking University,

721
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,620
Li Ping entered a vocational school,

722
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,980
and I ended up as a salesperson
in a department store.

723
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,340
We all have bright futures.

724
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,500
That enlightened me!

725
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,060
That's right!

726
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,060
Every road leads to Rome.

727
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,620
I can't be defeated
by such a small obstacle.

728
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,060
I want to thank the leadership
of the food factory

729
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,740
for providing me with a new

730
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,420
and bright future

731
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,380
when I was lost and confused.

732
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,780
So, starting today,

733
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,660
I'm dedicating

734
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,180
all my youth and passion

735
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,140
to this food factory.

736
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,940
I want to put down roots here, grow,
and flourish.

737
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,260
Yeah!

738
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,780
See how well Xiaolu speaks?

739
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,340
He's always been

740
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,460
good at making a speech.

741
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,220
He's a perfect boy!

742
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,300
His writing is pretty good too.

743
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,340
That's right.

744
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,220
Was that speech just now
good enough for you?

745
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,940
I almost had a heart attack.

746
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,300
It's all your fault.

747
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,900
But honestly,

748
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,900
don't ask me to do this again in the future.

749
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,900
I used to be good at self-criticizing,

750
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,560
but now everything I say
feels like a self-critique.

751
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,140
You are not bad

752
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,260
when you are serious.

753
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,660
You should change yourself.

754
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,540
I can't change anyway.

755
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,940
You can let that female college student

756
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,100
make the speech.

757
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,300
She looks most suitable for

758
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,620
making those righteous speeches.

759
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,060
You mean Bai Lan?

760
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,900
Yes.

761
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,700
My grudge with her isn't settled yet.

762
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,860

764
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,580
Why?

765
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,180
She is

766
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,300
not quite clean.

767
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,820

768

What do you mean?

769
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,700
Her record is not clean.

770
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,220
She's stabbed someone with a knife.

771
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,620
Really?

772
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,300
Bai Lan stabbed someone with a knife?

773
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,940
No wonder she's so wild.

774
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,100
She even dared to hit my cousin's head.

775
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,980
So she's a repeat offender?

776
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,540
That little brat!

777
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,340
But she didn't kill anyone.

778
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,500
It was just a minor injury.

779
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,020
But she was once arrested.

780
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,140
That's absolutely true.

781
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,220
Don't tell anyone.

No need. I live in the dormitory.

796
