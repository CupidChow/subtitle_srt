What's that?

the most important thing

191
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,620
Whatever you think.

192
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,740
Just don't tell him
it was me who told you.

193
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,250
Fine.

194
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,350
I'll hang up now.

195
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,180
What are you thinking?

196
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,890
Wondering how many days
Xiaolu has been gone?

197
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,450
I've cut ties with him.

198
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,060
Why would I think about him?

199
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,140
Please don't mention him in front of me.

200
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,500
What if I said

201
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,650
there's an opportunity to go to Shanghai?

202
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,140
So what?

203
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,350
If you want to go, go by yourself.

204
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,410
I won't go to see him.

205
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,450
I didn't say we were going to see him.

206
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,740
There's an import food fair in Shanghai

207
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,700
with many foreign drinks being sold.

208
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,860
Let's go take a look.

209
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,260
Maybe it'll be enlightening.

210
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,100
- Really?
- Yes.

211
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,530
Then let me take a look.

212
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,340
(Whole Wheat "Gold Bricks"
From Australia)

213
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,770
Looks pretty good.

214
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,290
When should we book our tickets?

215
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,740
Why are you laughing?

216
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,460
I just want to

217
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,410
attend

218
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,120
this import food fair,

219
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,580
not to see Lu Xiaolu.

220
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,590
Alright, alright.

221
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,550
We'll attend the fair.

222
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,790
We won't see Lu Xiaolu in Shanghai.

223
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,950
Of course we won't.

224
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
I don't have time for him.

225
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,010
Don't end up soft-hearted
and go see him when we are there.

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Ma'am.

227
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,550
Miss Bai.

228
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,290
Why are you back so early today?

229
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,260
I went to buy some dinner.

230
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,490
Where's your younger brother?

231
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,530
Is he upstairs?

232
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
He's not here.

233
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,760
He's at the hospital.

234
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,290
He needs to be observed
for a few more days.

235
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,410
Come on.

236
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,550
Stop sneaking around,

237
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,810
you two.

238
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,810
Do you think I'm blind and deaf?

239
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,380
You're lying to me.

240
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,830
And lying is not right.

241
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,740
Do you understand?

242
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,930
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

243
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,140
We've been going through
a really tough time lately.

244
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,950
Once we start making money,

245
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,070
we'll move out right away.

246
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,260
Well, I don't mean that.

247
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,010
Everyone goes through a youthful phase.

248
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,510
I must say,

249
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,460
I can see you are having it tough.

250
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,770
Oh well, whatever.

251
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,640
Seeing as

252
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,500
you observed the rules,

253
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,010
I won't hold it against you.

254
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,580
Really, Ma'am?

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,980
Thank you so much.

256
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,530
But

257
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,410
living like this

258
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,500
is tough.

259
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,530
In the long run,

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,080
I don't think

261
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,170
you can keep it up.

262
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,290
What do you mean?

263
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,410
You know.

264
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,260
Mr. Yang.

265
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,930
Miss Bai.

266
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,630
About that new assignment
you mentioned last time,

267
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,410
is there still a chance?

268
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
Miss Bai,

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,860
you just gave it up like that,

270
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,620
the opportunity won't wait for you.

271
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,000
Look.

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500
So many girls are here

273
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,980
to interview for it.

274
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,480
Has the model been decided?

275
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,120
Not yet.

276
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,410
The competition is fierce,

277
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,690
and the standards are high.

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,410
We'll have to choose carefully.

279
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,650
Count me in.

280
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,630
Hey, Miss...

281
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,270
Hey, Xiaolu.

282
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
I've been winning money recently
playing mahjong,

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
but one of the losers
didn't have cash to pay me,

284
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,140
so he gave me a German-imported camera.

285
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,070
Do you want it for your girlfriend?

286
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,910
How much is it?

287
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,460
It's cheap, only 1,000 yuan.

288
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,980
That's too expensive.

289
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,890
I haven't even received
my first month's salary yet.

290
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,170
Not expensive at all.

291
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,760
If you're not willing
to spend on your girlfriend,

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,550
she'll be upset.

293
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,910
If she finds out I'm spending recklessly,

294
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,980
she'll be even angrier.

295
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,360
Alright.

296
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,290
Who told you to put that there?

297
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,390
It can't be put here.

298
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,000
Who are you to meddle so much?

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
- This can't be here.
- Stop it!

300
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,050
Are you crazy?

301
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,760
- Sorry, sorry.
- You don't know how to walk?

302
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,190
- You have no eyes?
- I didn't mean to do that.

303
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,030
I am sorry.

304
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,580
What do you mean by that?

305
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,710
- You didn't mean to?
- Lu Xiaolu!

306
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,670
Are you blaming me?

307
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,510
No.

308
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
Why do you cause trouble everywhere?

309
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,650
If you want to quit, just say it.

310
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,000
A star-rated hotel

311
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,430
should have star-level service.

312
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,310
With a service like this,
how many stars do you deserve?

313
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,980
We apologize sincerely.

314
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,380
We'll punish him.

315
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,410
Apologize now.

316
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,750
I am sorry.

317
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,500
You've dirtied the guest's heels.

318
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,460
Clean them.

319
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
Lu Xiaolu,

320
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,340
do you want to get fired?

321
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
Can you wipe it clean
with your dirty sleeve?

322
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,260
If you can't,

323
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,050
then use your face.

324
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,580
Oh, forget it, forget it.

325
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,500
Stupid doorman. Such bad luck.

326
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,690
I'm really sorry.

327
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,710
Where are you going?

328
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,810
Let me call a taxi for you.

329
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,310
That woman humiliated you like that

330
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,340
and you actually endured it?

331
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,170
Are you still Lu Xiaolu?

332
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,580
It's none of your business.

333
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,100
I know it's none of my business.

334
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm here for the food exhibition.

335
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,260
Who knew I'd stumble upon

336
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,460
something I shouldn't have seen.

337
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,410
I know you're still mad at me.

338
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,240
I was really wrong about
what happened with Dajiang.

339
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,170
I apologize to you.

340
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,310
You can even cripple me right now

341
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,340
as long as you can forgive me.

342
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,480
Alright?

343
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,890
I just have one request, Xiaolu,

344
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,010
go back with me.

345
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,890
Let's leave this mean city.

346
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,510
Really.

347
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,230
Let's go back and focus on our business.

348
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,280
In the future,
we'll be the guests of big hotels.

349
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,050
You won't have to bow
and scrape to them anymore.

350
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,530
Don't worry about me.

351
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,380
I'm doing fine in Shanghai.

352
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
Stop being stubborn.

353
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,530
I saw what happened just now.

354
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,290
You are suffering as a doorman,

355
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,810
moreover, that picture of Bai Lan...

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
That's your woman!

357
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
Are you really so eager for money?

358
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,620
Li Guangnan, if you say one more word,

359
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,100
do you believe I'll kick you out?

360
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,030
Li Guangnan!

361
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,710
Sorry, Xiaolu.

362
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,980
Li Guangnan didn't mean that.

363
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,770
Lu Xiaolu, what are you doing here?

364
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,010
Zhang is so busy,

365
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,410
and you're hiding here drinking coffee.

366
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,890
Do you think you're a customer?

367
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,310
I'm discussing business
with a guest here.

368
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,580
Who do you think you are to interfere?

369
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm sorry, sir.

370
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,830
Lu Xiaolu is our doorman.

371
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,190
It's his working hours now.

372
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,460
He's my guest at the moment.

373
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,740
Is this how you treat my guest?

374
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,380
Apologize to him.

375
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,860
I'm sorry, sir.

376
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,580
Please take your time.

377
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,150
Wait a minute.

378
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,220
Do you need anything else, sir?

379
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,530
My shoes are dirty.

380
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,860
You have
shoe polishing service here, right?

381
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,290
Please wait a moment.

382
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,650
I'll call someone to assist you.

383
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,380
I don't need anyone else.

384
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,650
I want you to do it.

385
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,380
It's just about money, right?

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Polish them.

387
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,650
Not mine.

388
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,170
His.

389
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,810
Li Guangnan, that's enough!

390
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,820
I don't need you to show off here.

391
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,860
Do you think I'm showing off?

392
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,930
I'm just trying to prevent someone

393
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,960
from breaking your dignity with money!

394
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,280
This is the path I've chosen for myself.

395
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,120
What path?

396
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,730
The path of a doorman?

397
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,000
Working like a dog every day

398
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,150
just to be a good doorman?

399
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,060
Li Guangnan, keep quiet for a bit.

400
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,780
Now you find my words offensive, huh?

401
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,820
What did he say back then?

402
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,060
Why did he come to Shanghai?

403
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,590
To see the new world
and live a better life.

404
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,690
What about now?

405
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,080
Lu Xiaolu,

406
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,100
look at what you've become.

407
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,710
Leave.

408
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,950
Get out.

409
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,930
How's life

410
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,780
over here?

411
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,280
Good.

412
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,250
If my mom asks,

413
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,170
tell her

414
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,450
I'm doing fine in Shanghai,

415
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,410
making money.

416
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,620
Li Guangnan isn't good with words.

417
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,540
Don't take it to heart.

418
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,730
This is from Li Guangnan.

419
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,000
You need money

420
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,970
while you're away from home.

421
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,490
Take it.

422
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,340
When you meet problems,
don't keep them to yourself.

423
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,140
Give us a call.

424
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,140
(Health Milk)

425
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,780
(Milk Tea)

426
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,730
If I knew this was your daily job,

427
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,580
I definitely wouldn't have let you go.

428
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,890
Don't go there tomorrow,

429
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,560
okay?

430
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,620
Am I embarrassing you by being a model?

431
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,630
No,

432
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,250
I just don't want you
to take that kind of photo.

433
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,180
The original price is 2,300 yuan,
I'll give it to you for 1,000.

434
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,380
You've won quite a lot
playing mahjong, huh?

435
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,890
Just some old friends

436
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,970
playing for fun.

437
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,790
Why did you change your mind

438
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,020
and decide to buy the camera now?

439
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,370
It's my girlfriend's birthday.

440
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,470
Got it.

441
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,410
Your girlfriend asked you for a gift,
didn't she?

442
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,380
I actually hope she'd ask for something.

443
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,490
But she doesn't do that,

444
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,730
she just endures in silence.

445
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,860
You naive guy,

446
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,250
do you really believe that?

447
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,550
The girl on that human-shaped signboard

448
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,580
was your girlfriend, right?

449
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,970
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

450
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,780
That industry is like a big vat of dye,

451
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,070
full of temptations.

452
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,890
Even the best girls will change.

453
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,870
The less she tells you,

454
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,340
the more you should watch her closely.

455
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,630
Zhang,

456
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,580
don't speak ill of my girlfriend.

457
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,060
I'm just reminding you.

458
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,250
Why are you upset?

459
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,620
I can see you've had it tough.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,840
How about this?

461
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,250
I'll give you a 20% discount.

462
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
How about that?

463
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,670
Really?

464
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,710
Yes.

465
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,190
Thank you, Zhang.

466
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,390
You are welcome.

467
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,690
We're friends, aren't we?

468
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,310
- Manager Cao!
- Lu Xiaolu.

469
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,590
I couldn't find you anywhere.

470
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,020
I just delivered the luggage upstairs.

471
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,360
Hurry up

472
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,580
and push these suitcases over.

473
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,170
Alright, on it.

474
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,870
Listen,

475
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,890
I have an old client

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,410
who insists on seeing you.

477
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,150
You mean that Health Milk?

478
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,070
No,

479
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,250
it's a bigger client.

480
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,870
You'll see him in a moment.

481
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,250
Come on, this way.

482
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,670
There he is.

483
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,390
Mr. Huang.

484
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,990
Oh, hello.

485
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,620
Let me introduce you.

486
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,530
This is

487
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,280
Mr. Huang Qing from
Hong Kong Investment Group.

488
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,200
He's been in the mainland
for a short time

489
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,450
and has opened several subsidiaries.

490
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,730
He's young and promising.

491
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,060
Miss Bai Lan,

492
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,410
nice to meet you.

493
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,730
- Please, have a seat.
- Sure, thank you.

494
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,990
Miss Bai,

495
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,450
I saw your photo at the hotel exhibition,

496
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,450
and I was immediately drawn to it.

497
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,730
Thank you.

498
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,200
In my opinion,

499
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,020
those photos are sexy but not vulgar,

500
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,970
thanks to your skill

501
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,100
and your personal charm.

502
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,300
That's also why
I'm here to meet you today.

503
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,970
Do you also want me to be your model?

504
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,280
Yes.

505
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,170
My company is promoting
an Italian jewelry brand,

506
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,100
and I want you to be the model for it.

507
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,650
But I'm afraid I can't accept this job.

508
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,730
Last time it was 500 yuan a month,

509
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,890
this time I'm offering you
500 yuan a day.

510
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,690
I still can't accept.

511
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,860
Miss Bai,

512
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,890
please think it over.

513
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,580
It's such a rare opportunity.

514
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,380
If it was a few days ago,

515
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,490
maybe I could accept it.

516
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,760
Why?

517
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,780
Because my boyfriend
doesn't want me to be a model.

518
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,620
Although I really need money,

519
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,670
my boyfriend

520
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,340
is more important.

521
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm sorry.

522
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,020
I'll take my leave.

523
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,300
Miss Bai, Miss...

524
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,490
Let me talk to her again.

525
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,430
Miss Bai,

526
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,820
500 yuan a day,

527
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,730
not 500 a month.

528
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,540
(Blue Road)

529
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,020
I thought you weren't coming.

530
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,170
I thought you were angry and not coming.

531
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,820
Even if I were angry, I'd still come.

532
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,790
That's right. Of course we'll come.

533
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,930
It was a deal.

534
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,110
Luckily, the place didn't close.
Let's go.

535
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,690
I suddenly changed my taste.

536
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,040
Let's go.

537
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,700
(Blue Road)

538
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,890
Noodles instead of Western food.

539
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,690
That's another fancy dinner I owe you.

540
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,080
Not at all.

541
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,240
It's our own restaurant anyway.

542
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,540
We can eat whenever we want.

543
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,080
True.

544
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,100
Close your eyes.

545
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,070
Why?

546
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,910
Just close them.

547
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,910
Happy birthday!

548
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,690
A camera?

549
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,070
This is for you,

550
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,100
but also for me.

551
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,140
What do you mean?

552
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,300
I want to learn photography.

553
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,920
In the future, I'll find clients for you

554
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,890
and help you take photos.

555
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,790
That way,

556
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,250
you won't have to suffer so much.

557
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,580
It's not that simple.

558
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,390
It does sound a little far-fetched.

559
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,280
But if we work together,

560
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,590
there's nothing we can't achieve.

561
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,650
What if we succeed?

562
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,620
But right now, your main focus
should be on studying.

563
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,790
If you don't want me
to go to the advertisement,

564
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,780
I won't go.

565
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,820
I just don't want you to be too tired.

566
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,170
Let me share some of the burden.

567
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,300
You don't trust that
I can learn photography?

568
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,820
No,

569
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,410
it's just not the right time now.

570
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,820
I just don't want you
to become more tired

571
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,250
or do things you don't want to do

572
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,860
because I am here.

573
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,020
Are you still mad at me?

574
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,020
Actually, I don't see anything wrong
with those photos.

575
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,410
I just

576
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,380
feel bad for you.

577
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,970
Let's take a picture.

578
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,670
I'll do it.

579
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,930
Three, two, one.

580
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,250
How is Lu Xiaolu usually at work?

581
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,590
Oh, he's pretty diligent,

582
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,440
just a bit mischievous.

583
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,620
- Mischievous?
- Hey, stop.

584
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,300
Yes, sir.
Manager Cao, what's the matter?

585
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,730
He's Lu Xiaolu.

586
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,000
You are Lu Xiaolu?

587
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,840
That's me.

588
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,110
A guest lost something.

589
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,220
We have some questions for you.

590
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,410
What was lost?

591
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,540
The front desk staff

592
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,930
saw you yesterday at lunch break

593
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,440
taking pictures of foreign guests

594
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,620
in the garden with a German camera.

595
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes, I did that.

596
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,760
What's the issue?

597
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,140
Manager Cao, that didn't affect my work.

598
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,300
Let's discuss this somewhere else.

599
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
Okay.

600
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,380
Tell me,
where did you put the stolen camera?

601
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,280
I told you, the camera wasn't stolen.

602
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,580
It was sold to me by Zhang.

603
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,860
Who is Zhang?

604
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,020
Zhang Teng, my colleague.

605
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,350
He said he won the camera

606
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,630
in a mahjong game

607
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,730
and sold it to me cheaply.

608
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,390
Do you have any proof
of this transaction,

609
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,820
like a note?

610
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,450
I thought we were friends,

611
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,860
so I didn't ask for any proof.

612
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,200
Do you think this is our small town?

613
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,870
This is Shanghai, you know.

614
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,020
Who would be friends with you?

615
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,890
It's okay. Ask him and you'll get clarity.

616
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,140
Manager Cao,

617
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,630
I checked.

618
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,390
Zhang resigned last weekend.

619
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,820
No one knows where he went.

620
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,100
Do you have anything else to say?

621
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,490
In modern business cooperation,

622
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,490
the spirit of the contract
is one of the most important qualities.

623
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,360
However,

624
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,890
there is also a force majeure clause

625
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,730
in the terms.

626
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,450
Just last week,

627
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,410
I was a victim of theft

628
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,730
at the hotel

629
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,020
where I stayed.

630
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,020
I had to call the police,
which delayed our lecture

631
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,620
and caused a breach of contract.

632
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,820
Everyone,

633
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,550
do you think what I just said

634
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,930
constitutes force majeure?

635
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,550
No.

636
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,390
Yes.

637
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,890
- No.
- Yes.

638
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,080
Quiet,

639
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,580
everyone quiet.

640
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,140
Miss Bai Lan,

641
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,490
what do you think?

642
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,490
How did he know your name?

643
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,540
I don't think it does.

644
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,320
Why?

645
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,300
You only realized today
that something was missing,

646
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,170
indicating that you are usually
negligent with your belongings.

647
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,450
After you noticed,
you promptly reported it,

648
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,300
which was your proactive choice.

649
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,000
However, if you felt that

650
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,930
this lecture was important enough,

651
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,020
you could have waited until it ended
before reporting it.

652
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,580
Perhaps this incident

653
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,300
was a distraction for you,

654
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,930
but it's not enough
to justify your lateness.

655
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,430
She's right.

656
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,930
A mere camera

657
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,690
shouldn't be an excuse for me
to violate the spirit of the contract.

658
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,710
Alright,

659
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,560
let's continue.

660
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,590
- Comrade.
- Move.

661
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,170
It really wasn't me.
You've got the wrong person.

662
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,900
- It was Zhang Teng.
- Go explain it at the police station.

663
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,990
Zhang Teng has already fled.

664
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,930
- Cooperate.
- Manager Cao.

665
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,220
- Manager Cao.
- Get in the car.

666
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,970
- Manager Cao, please believe me.
- Cooperate.

667
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,340
- Listen to my explanation.
- Get in the car.

668
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,310
Stop dawdling. Get in the car.

669
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,210
It was Zhang Teng!

670
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
Manager Cao!

671
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,560
Mr. Huang,

672
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,650
thank you very much for giving such

673
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,490
a wonderful presentation to the students.

674
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,390
Don't mention it.

675
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,250
Next time you come to Hong Kong,

676
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,590
I'll take you to eat some great food.

677
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,560
Alright.

678
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,060
How was the food in Shanghai this time?

679
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,350
It suited my taste.

680
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,200
Great. Next time, try Shanghai potstickers.

681
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Mr. Huang.

682
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,890
- Professor.
- Bai Lan.

683
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,970
Where did you go this afternoon?

684
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,300
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

685
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,880
Mr. Huang,

686
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,870
I have an unwelcome request to make.

687
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,860
Miss Bai, you have changed your mind

688
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,410
and want to accept my invitation?

689
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,910
What,

690
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,930
you know each other?

691
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,150
You can take your time.

692
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,090
I have something to attend to.

693
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,450
- Alright, thank you.
- Goodbye.

694
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,410
It's about the camera incident.

695
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,860
Can you please stop pursuing it?

696
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,430
Why?

697
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,170
Because if you continue pursuing it,

698
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,820
a good person might be wronged.

699
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,020
So, the person who stole my camera

700
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,100
is your friend?

701
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,730
It's my boyfriend.

702
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,100
But I assure you,
he's not that kind of person.

703
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,340
He wouldn't steal.

704
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,100
If he's truly been wronged,

705
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,970
the evidence will clear his name.

706
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,410
That's not my responsibility.

707
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,060
If you can help me with it,

708
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,070
I can shoot those advertisements

709
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,200
according to your requirements,

710
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,380
free of charge.

711
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,650
If you agree because of this reason,

712
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,020
it will seem like I coerced you.

713
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,730
Please help us.

714
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,410
I can't interfere with legal procedures.

715
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,490
I'm sorry.

716
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,170
What if I say

717
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,140
I made him steal it?

718
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,380
Is it worth it for a boyfriend

719
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
like this?

720
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,730
There's no other way.

721
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,930
If you really do this,

722
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,060
it's your choice.

723
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,020
If you're willing to face
the consequences, then fine.

724
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,060
You're back.

725
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,480
I just made instant noodles.

726
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,410
Let me get you a bowl.

727
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,060
Here, eat while it's hot.

728
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,580
You went to

729
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,410
the police station today?

730
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,140
Why would you take the blame for me?

731
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,480
I'd rather go to jail myself

732
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,340
than leave any blemish on your record.

733
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,380
Let's forget about this.

734
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,620
Don't mention it anymore.

735
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,100
How can we just forget?

736
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,630
It wasn't me who stole it.

737
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,890
Why admit to it?

738
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,380
Or were you never really sure about me?

739
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,370
I believe in you, so what?

740
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,520
I believe in you,

741
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,980
but others won't.

742
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,250
If they don't believe,
we can prove it to them.

743
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,580
There's always a way.

744
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
We've faced many

745
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,580
challenges in Fucheng,

746
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,850
so why can't we get through this one?

747
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,210
That was in Fucheng.

748
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,690
Now we're in Shanghai.

749
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,100
So what if it is Shanghai?

750
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,800
The Bai Lan I know

751
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
would never compromise

752
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,240
no matter how much she's been wronged.

753
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,950
What about you?

754
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,800
The Lu Xiaolu I know

755
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,690
wouldn't willingly be a doorman.

756
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,250
What do you mean?

757
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,620
Am I embarrassing you
by being a doorman?

758
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,510
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,330
That's not what I meant.

760
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,500
But I feel...

761
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,770
I feel...

762
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,170
I don't want to argue with you.

763
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,810
Let's eat noodles.

764
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,580
They are getting mushy.

765
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:58,220
(Disciplinary Action Against Bai Lan)

766
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,730
I'm back.

767
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,770
I brought some pan-fried buns for you.

768
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,240
Bai Lan,

769
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,110
I'm sorry.

770
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,160
I have left.

771
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,770
You're right.

772
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,140
Shanghai is big

773
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,730
and nice,

774
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,420
but it belongs to you,

775
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,370
not me.

776
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,650
Perhaps you'll call me a coward

777
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,370
or even a liar.

778
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,950
I know,

779
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,730
we made many promises back then,

780
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,360
and I tried hard

781
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,020
to realize them with you.

782
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,690
But now I realize

783
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,250
I can't do it.

784
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,860
I chose to stay in Shanghai

785
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,220
to brighten and warm

786
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,260
your life

787
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,860
with my presence,

788
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,180
but in reality,

789
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,620
it made your life just as messy as mine.

790
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,340
Those moments of happiness

791
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,060
are like sand by the sea.

792
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,940
Even if we both
give our all for each other,

793
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,100
(Blue Road)
they still slip away bit by bit.

794
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,940
I try desperately

795
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,860
just to find I can't even
catch the passing breeze.

796
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,300
If I could go back,

797
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,420
I would still tell that Lu Xiaolu

798
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,220
sitting on the train,

799
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
he'll spend beautiful times

800
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,020
in Shanghai.

801
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,500
But please forgive me

802
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,180
for choosing to be a disgraceful deserter.

803
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,660
I willingly disappear from your life.

804
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,420
I hope

805
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,620
you forget the arguments we had,

806
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,980
forget my disturbances,

807
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
my entanglements,

808
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,380
and also the immature
and insignificant me

809
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,420
to embrace the future
that truly belongs to you.

810
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,380
I wish you a smooth life

811
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,940
and success in all your endeavors.
