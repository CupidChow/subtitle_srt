Did you hear the news?

Dr. Bai has been reassigned
to the boiler room.

34
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,340
The boiler room?

35
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,300
They say it's because she issued

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,060
a fake mental issue certificate for Afang

37
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,260
and got reported to the police

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,840
by Ding Dezhong's wife.

39
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,540
Xiaolu!

40
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,860
Anyone here?

41
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,460
Hello,

42
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm Bai Lan.

43
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
I'm reporting in.

44
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,020
It's not like

45
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,940
anyone can work in our boiler room.

46
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,580
There are rules here.

47
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,380
What rules?

48
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,900
The first rule is

49
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,460
we never welcome traitors

50
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,060
who bully the working class.

51
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,620
What do you mean?

52
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,380
What do I mean? You don't understand?

53
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,820
Everyone in our factory knows

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Afang isn't mentally ill.

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,690
Why did you issue a fake certificate
to harm her?

56
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
Today, I'm going
to uphold justice for her.

57
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,300
Are you in love with Afang?

58
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,580
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

59
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,500
Our relationship is pure
working-class friendship.

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,900
It's just that I can't stand

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,140
your despicable tactics.

62
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,140
So despicable.

63
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,300
Unbelievable.

64
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,130
What about the second rule?

65
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140
The second rule...

66
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,420
I'll tell you when I think of it.

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
Okay, then, I'll go to work.

68
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,700
If you want to join our working class,

69
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,140
you need to have the skills of us.

70
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,620
See that?

71
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,660
That pile of coal,

72
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,980
move it all

73
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,940
to the opposite corner within an hour.

74
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,300
Then you pass the test.

75
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,420
How about that?

76
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,580
Get started.

77
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,220
Hey, don't just stand there.

78
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,300
Clock is ticking.

79
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
Hurry up.

80
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,620
- You scumbag!
- I...

81
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,940
How could a man like you bully a woman?

82
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,780
- No...
- Xiaolu.

83
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,900
She cozied up to Ding Dezhong.

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,260
I'm avenging Afang.

85
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,940
- Continue.
- We should stick together.

86
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,860
Lu Xiaolu,

87
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,980
what are you doing?

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,580
Don't think you can act arrogant
because you're

89
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,660
a hero in the factory now.

90
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,740
Let me tell you...

91
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,780
Xiaolu!

92
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,540
You wait!

93
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,980
Don't go. I'll come back.

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,660
- Wait for me.
- This is not over.

95
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,540
Let's go.

96
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,820
- What are you doing?
- Come.

97
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,460
Hey, let go.

98
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,740
Pack up and go back

99
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,460
to the medical room to work.
Don't come here again.

100
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,820
I accepted it.

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
I issued the fake certificate,

102
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,140
it's only right that I'm punished.

103
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,540
But the one who suggested it was me.

104
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,300
If anyone's punished, it should be me.

105
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,220
Do you regret it?

106
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,140
Do you regret helping Afang?

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,740
Of course not.

108
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,740
I don't regret it either.

109
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,700
But if you stay here,

110
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,620
what if Dakang and the others
bully you again?

111
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,380
Do you think they can bully me?

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,340
Catch.

113
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,260
Next time they bully me, I'll hit them.

114
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,260
- Hit them hard.
- Hit them hard.

115
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,900
Hey, why are you hitting me?

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,260
- You should hit them.
- I'm practicing on you.

117
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,460
=Episode 6=
=Pink Memories=

118
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,660
You're all dirty.

119
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,780
Oh my! You scared me.

120
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,300
Why are you hiding here

121
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,260
during lunch break?

122
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,380
This electric fan is in such bad shape.

123
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,380
Why bother fixing it?

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,900
You don't understand.

125
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,020
I can turn even

126
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,500
rubbish into treasures.

127
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,500
Not bad.

128
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,420
Where did you find these things?

129
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,220
These are all treasures.

130
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,020
Big Feet.

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,060
Alright, I'll help you make a new one.

132
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,780
Thanks.

133
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,980
How is it?

134
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,340
- It's nothing.
- Xiaolu,

135
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,620
come have a cup of tea.

136
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,660
Debao.

137
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,140
What did you put in this tea?

138
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
It's the cooling tea I prepared.

139
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,220
I brewed mint and tea leaves together.

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,380
Isn't it refreshing?

141
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,100
This invention is amazing!

142
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,460
What are you saying?

143
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,860
It's hardly an invention.

144
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,860
You are even speaking up for Bai Lan?

145
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,420
Have you forgotten how she

146
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
slandered your uncle?

147
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,100
You know if it was a slander or not.

148
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,020
What are you saying?

149
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,060
Who raised you from childhood?

150
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,900
You forgot?

151
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,020
Now that you have grown up,

152
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,540
you're turning against me, right?

153
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,580
Then I'll just leave now.

154
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,900
I'll give you back everything
you've given me.

155
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,260
How are you going to repay me?

156
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,940
What?

157
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,780
Go away!

158
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,860
What are you...

159
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,220
Hey, sweetie, sweetie.

160
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,740
I don't want you. I want meat.

161
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,820
What are you doing here?

162
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,860
Are you alright?

163
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,860
Did Ding Dezhong scold you again?

164
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,460
Not only did we argue,

165
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,780
but I was also kicked out.

166
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Now I have nowhere to go.

167
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,300
Are you happy now?

168
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,460
Stop crying.

169
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Don't look this way.

170
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,180
Turn around.

171
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,180
Ding Dezhong is Ding Dezhong,

172
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,300
and you are you.

173
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,420
Even if others don't understand you,

174
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,740
I do.

175
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,940
What's the use of your understanding?

176
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,660
Lu Xiaolu, that heartless scoundrel.

177
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,740
He knows nothing.

178
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,820
Lu Xiaolu is just a big fool.

179
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,020
When we go back,
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

180
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,380
I don't want to go back.

181
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,980
Everyone will hate me because

182
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,420
I'm Ding Dezhong's niece.

183
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,420
No one will like me.

184
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,380
How do you know no one likes you?

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,340
Clearly,

186
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,500
someone is full of thoughts about you,

187
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,940
but you just can't see it.

188
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,100
If you have nowhere to go,

189
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
I'll just take care of you.

190
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,060
Li Guangnan,

191
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,020
I consider you a friend.

192
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,100
Don't think about taking advantage of me.

193
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,020
What you are saying is unreasonable.

194
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm just willing to help a friend.

195
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,100
Why do you think of me like that?

196
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,340
Even if you're pretty,

197
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,900
that's not enough for me
to make mistakes.

198
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,580
And let me tell you,

199
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,620
you're not that pretty.

200
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,620
At most,

201
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,260
you're third in Fucheng.

202
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,300
Third?

203
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
Why am I third?

204
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,820
Who's first?

205
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,060
First is, of course, Guanyin Bodhisattva.

206
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,700
And second?

207
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,260
Second

208
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,020
is Mazu.

209
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,620
Smooth talker.

210
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,060
I'm telling the truth.

211
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,300
You're definitely third.

212
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,540
Don't be greedy.

213
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,460
Li Guangnan, turn around.

214
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,380
I'm hungry.

215
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,420
You said you'd help your friend, right?

216
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,460
Treat me to a meal.

217
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,500
See?

218
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,060
How did he start

219
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,940
fiddling with these bottles and jars?

220
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,340
What is he messing around with?

221
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,260
He doesn't look like he's messing around.

222
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,180
Is he creating a new product

223
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,580
for the factory?

224
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,100
What new product?

225
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,580
He's in maintenance.

226
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,820
What,

227
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,900
did he switch to R&amp;D?

228
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,460
That's a good thing.

229
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,020
What future does maintenance have?

230
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,820
Technical jobs are different.

231
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,380
You fool.

232
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,180
Your son's in love.

233
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,020
He's grown up?

234
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,820
He's grown up.

235
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,900
Seeing you, a college graduate,

236
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,260
doing this kind of work

237
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,940
really pains my heart.

238
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,540
Unfortunately,

239
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
my abilities are limited,

240
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,500
and I couldn't help you.

241
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,830
College graduates are also human beings.

242
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,340
Why can others do things

243
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,860
while I cannot?

244
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,140
But...

245
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,540
Let me do it.

246
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,300
I'll help you.

247
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
I feel it's such a waste for you.

248
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,340
This matter

249
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,500
shouldn't be blamed on you at all.

250
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,820
It's just because

251
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,100
you're here without any support.

252
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
No one is backing you.

253
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,780
It's working hours now.

254
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Don't disturb me at work.

255
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,940
Do you just

256
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,100
want to keep staying here?

257
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,260
Bai Lan.

258
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,500
What are you doing?

259
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,140
As long as you're willing to trust me,

260
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,460
I can take care of you

261
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
and protect you.

262
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,180
Bai Lan.

263
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,020
You guys in the boiler room work late.

264
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,260
I know you haven't taken a hot shower
in days.

265
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,540
You can do it here.

266
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,220
Bah! Lunch time!

267
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
Hey, I...

268
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,220
Who's this?

269
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,860
Lu Xiaolu?

270
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,940
Why are you here during work hours?

271
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,300
It's lunch break.

272
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,260
Lunch break...

273
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,980
What are you doing?

274
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,860
What are you doing?

275
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,040
Stay away from me!

276
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,680
I heard there are a lot of flies
in the boiler room,

277
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,580
so I came to chase them away.

278
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,540
Flies?

279
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,340
There are the most flies in your
maintenance department,

280
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,940
and they're all headless flies.

281
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
With these gloves,

282
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,780
you won't be afraid of getting burned

283
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,620
or cut in the future.

284
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,940
It's quite thick.

285
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,220
Thank you.

286
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,220
What's this?

287
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,380
It's a specially made
jasmine iced tea for you,

288
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,020
plus your favorite milk.

289
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,780
Try it.

290
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,700
How is it?

291
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,580
Is it good?

292
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,780
It's a bit strange

293
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,940
but still good.

294
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,620
See? I knew it.

295
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,340
Just now, I saw Bi Zhigang

296
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
handing you a letter.

297
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,180
A love letter?

298
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,820
Are you curious?

299
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,340
What's there to be curious about?

300
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,620
I'm just reminding you as a good friend.

301
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,900
Bi Zhigang is not a good person.

302
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,060
He's scheming, cunning,

303
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,900
and hypocritical.

304
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,300
Don't fall for his tricks.

305
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,420
Come on,

306
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,340
take a look.

307
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,420
Hmm?

308
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,700
Didn't you say you weren't curious?

309
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,700
I'm just helping you

310
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
as a friend

311
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,300
so you don't get deceived.

312
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,380
Come on, let me see.

313
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,540
Let me see.

314
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,140
Why are you smiling?

315
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,740
This scoundrel.

316
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,520
(Grand Hotel)
I knew he was bearing evil intentions.

317
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,460
It's a three-star hotel.

318
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,980
You're not allowed to go.

319
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,420
Why not?

320
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,700
Hello, sir. Do you have a reservation?

321
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,180
Has anyone come to room 412?

322
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,300
Let me check for you.

323
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,860
Oh, the guest has already checked in.

324
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,540
Bai Lan.

325
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,620
It's me, Bi Zhigang.

326
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,460
Take your time showering.

327
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,020
I'll wait outside for you.

328
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,060
Honestly,

329
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,780
I didn't expect you to actually come.

330
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,940
I feel like

331
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,980
I'm dreaming.

332
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,230
I remember the day
you first came to the factory.

333
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,420
You were wearing a snow-white

334
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,100
polyester skirt,

335
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,260
elegant

336
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,260
and stylish,

337
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,820
unlike any of

338
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,060
the other girls I've met before.

339
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,660
But I'm

340
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,380
just ordinary

341
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,180
and too introverted,

342
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,620
so I never

343
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,100
dared to confess to you.

344
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,900
Yeah,

345
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,860
I'm just ordinary.

346
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,790
Even though my dad is a leader
in the Second Light Industry Bureau,

347
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm

348
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,100
just a small,

349
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,620
ordinary office secretary.

350
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,180
Who knows when I'll become

351
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,260
a big leader?

352
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
I'm too introverted.

353
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,940
Many young and beautiful female comrades

354
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,540
in the factory try to talk to me,

355
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,900
but I don't know how to respond

356
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,520
and just end up blushing
and running away.

357
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,780
The female comrades
have opinions about me,

358
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,220
blaming me

359
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,380
for not giving them a chance.

360
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,020
But it's not that I don't want to...

361
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,940
No, no.

362
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Don't come out yet.

363
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,500
Let me finish.

364
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,660
Do you remember the chocolate I gave you?

365
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,780
When I was a child,

366
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,620
my parents always argued.

367
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,980
Whenever they did,

368
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,700
I would hide in a corner of the house

369
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,380
with a box of chocolates

370
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,020
and quietly eat them

371
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,460
because chocolates

372
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,180
gave me a sense of security.

373
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,020
I've seen your file.

374
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,060
I think in some ways,

375
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,140
we're both lonely people.

376
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,940
Lan,

377
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,380
I really don't want to see you

378
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,900
falling into despair

379
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,020
with someone like Lu Xiaolu.

380
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,420
If you're with me,

381
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,900
I promise you'll live a life

382
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,780
ten times,
a hundred times better than now.

383
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,660
I promise

384
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,540
you won't suffer any

385
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,360
innocent repercussions again.

386
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,820
Do you believe me?

387
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,780
I do.

388
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,460
Bi Zhigang,

389
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,700
your words just now are truly touching.

390
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,540
I'm really moved.

391
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Too moved.

392
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,300
Wait a minute. Why is it you?

393
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
Why couldn't it be me?

394
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,900
Where's Bai Lan?

395
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,700
I... I...

396
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,340
Unfortunately,

397
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,780
I'm a guy.

398
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
I've been working in the factory all day,

399
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,580
dirty and smelly.

400
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,780
Hey, haven't you been concerned about

401
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,800
your colleagues in the factory?

402
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,100
Can't I come over and take a shower?

403
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,540
No, I... I...

404
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,580
Besides, I'm just a lowly worker

405
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,220
who's never even stayed
in a star-rated hotel.

406
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,980
Secretary Bi,

407
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,060
you're so thoughtful.

408
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,780
You even bought me supper.

409
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,060
How considerate.

410
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,780
- Thanks.
- Put it down. Put it down.

411
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,220
It's not for you.

412
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,220
What's this?

413
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,820
You want to fight?

414
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
Can you beat me?

415
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,740
I...

416
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,660
Lu Xiaolu,

417
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,660
don't think you can act recklessly

418
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,340
just because your cousin backs you up.

419
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,340
Do you believe I can make things
very ugly for you?

420
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
I... I...

421
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,580
So, you're scared of my cousin, huh?

422
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,220
But let me tell you,

423
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,420
dealing with you

424
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,220
doesn't require his intervention.

425
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,060
Alright.

426
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,580
You guys wait and see.

427
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,500
I'll make you regret this.

428
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,060
Shameless.

429
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,220
Good speech.

430
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,620
Goodbye.

431
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,580
Hey, you're looking great in that outfit.

432
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,900
Couldn't tell you just got off
from the boiler room.

433
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,340
Cut it out.

434
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,260
Oh, you have no idea.

435
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,620
When I came out

436
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,460
of the shower just now,

437
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,900
Bi Zhigang's eyes nearly

438
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,300
popped out of his head.

439
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,580
It was so hilarious.

440
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,020
Too bad

441
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,340
you weren't there to witness
such a great scene.

442
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,900
I actually wanted to go.

443
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,240
You were the one who said I shouldn't.

444
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,620
Are you hungry?

445
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,820
Yeah.

446
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,820
Let's go.

447
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,340
(Gongyuan)

448
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,180
Ding Dezhong!

449
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,580
I'm telling you!

450
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,540
I will definitely leave the boiler room!

451
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,620
Definitely!

452
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,420
What should we do next?

453
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,060
Let's go back to sleep.

454
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,900
Oh, come on,

455
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,620
it's too early to sleep.

456
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,360
How about we go

457
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,900
catch that pervert?

458
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,140
We only caught a fake one.

459
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,540
The real one is still out there.

460
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,260
He's too scared to leave

461
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,580
his house for days.

462
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,860
We should just go to bed.

463
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,740
Hey, who's there?

464
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,800
Security.

465
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,180
Go.

466
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,580
Here.

467
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,140
Hey, who's that?

468
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,380
Wanna do something

469
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,260
more exciting?

470
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,820
With your poor tolerance for alcohol,

471
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,220
you shouldn't have drunk so much.

472
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,660
You got yourself all dirty.

473
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,780
Who said I have a poor alcohol tolerance?

474
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,780
Which room? Give me the key card.

475
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,900
See?

476
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,700
I told you I'm not drunk.

477
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,620
I can even find the key card.

478
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,260
Let's go.

479
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,060
Ding Dezhong,

480
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,580
come out and face me.

481
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,380
I'll teach you a lesson.

482
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,980
Lower your voice,

483
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
it's late at night.

484
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,380
Bai Lan.

485
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,620
Why are you calling my name?

486
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,460
Are you Bai Lan?

487
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,180
Yeah.

488
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,380
You're not Bai Lan.

489
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,260
Bai Lan is much prettier.

490
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,420
Is Bai Lan really that pretty?

491
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,500
Of course.

492
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,940
In my heart, Bai Lan

493
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,500
is so, so beautiful.

494
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,940
She's almost as pretty as Joey Wong.

495
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,580
Don't you think

496
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,140
she's weird

497
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,260
and violent?

498
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,300
If you badmouth Bai Lan again,

499
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,460
I'll punch you.

500
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,940
Even if I don't punch you,

501
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,740
if Bai Lan hears you,

502
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,020
she'll punch you too.

503
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,980
That woman is terrifying.

504
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,820
Then why are you defending her?

505
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,540
People are afraid of her

506
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,340
because they know nothing about her.

507
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,900
But I know

508
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,100
she's alone and

509
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,040

and Factory Director.

537
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,420
Next,

538
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,780
we invite Secretary Hong

539
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,140

Comrades and colleagues

of Golden Peacock Food Factory,

543
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,900
good morning.

544
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,060
First of all,

545
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,140
I would like to thank
the higher-level leadership

546
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,820
and the factory party committee

547
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,020
for their trust and support,

548
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,140
allowing me to temporarily
assume the positions

549
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,760
of secretary and factory director.

550
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,740
How was your sleep last night?

551
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,940
I fully obey the decisions of

552
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,880
- the party committee and leadership.
- What do you mean?

553
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,790
- I didn't return to the dorm last night.
- I hope that all comrades

554
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,330
- Didn't you sleep alone?
- can support and assist me

555
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,320
- Of course.
- in carrying out

556
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,540
- Otherwise, who would I sleep with?
- the factory's work.

557
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,020
You are weird.

558
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,060
Now,

559
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,980
the primary task of our factory

560
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,020
is to ensure production,

561
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,970
secure the welfare of all workers,

562
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,420
and quickly restore profitability.

563
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,380
Of course, to achieve this goal,

564
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,540
we need the concerted efforts

565
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,060
of everyone in the factory.

566
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,340
Why did you not come back last night?

567
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,300
Where did you go?

568
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,060
Little Pouter

569
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,460
was kicked out of her house.

570
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,740
She didn't want to yield

571
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,980
nor did she want to go back

572
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,100
to the dorm to face Bai Lan,

573
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,860
so I helped her carry her things out

574
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,380
and we spent the night at the guesthouse.

575
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,020
So you didn't come back all night.

576
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,740
You two stayed at the guesthouse?

577
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,860
Yeah.

578
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
So you two...

579
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,100
What are you thinking?

580
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,740
Who would do that before

581
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,260
confirming a relationship?

582
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,900
That's so improper.

583
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,300
Who could do such a thing?

584
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,380
I will humbly learn from everyone.

585
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,940
Let's all work together

586
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,980
to quickly make our Golden Peacock

587
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,100
bloom its beautiful feathers again.

588
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,980
Lu Xiaolu, if you don't confess today,

589
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
you're not a man.

590
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,620
Do you have something to say to me?

591
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,980
No.

592
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,420
- Last night...
- Last night...

593
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Did you sleep well last night?

594
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,940
Not bad.

595
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,540
Are you sober now?

596
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,020
Yes.

597
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,500
Do you remember
what happened last night?

598
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,980
Last night?

599
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,740
What do you mean?

600
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,240
It's good that you don't remember.

601
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,620
It's good that I don't remember?

602
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,900
What does she mean by that?

603
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,660
You rogue woman.

604
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,060
My cousin

605
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,940
met that woman at the skating rink.

606
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,980
She's extremely beautiful,

607
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,620
looked like the combination of

608
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,020
Rosamund Kwan and Vivian Chow.

609
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,900
From the first time they met,

610
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,460
she was all over my cousin.

611
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,140
So what happened next?

612
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,500
My cousin couldn't resist,

613
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,420
and that night, he confessed to her.

614
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,340
After dating for a week,

615
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,740
they talked about getting married.

616
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,080
But after they got married,

617
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,140
guess what?

618
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,340
What happened?

619
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
After they got married, he found out that

620
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,940
she had been a mistress

621
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,900
to a wealthy businessman.

622
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,420
She only came to my cousin

623
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,220
after the businessman was arrested.

624
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,300
That's why in those

625
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,660
martial arts novels,

626
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,260
the prettier the woman,

627
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,740
the better she is at deceiving.

628
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,940
See?

629
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,820
You young people,

630
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,420
before you get married,

631
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,660
you must go to the hospital

632
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,300
for a check-up.

633
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,200
You must check thoroughly
before you get married.

634
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,980
How do men get checked?

635
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,500
For men,

636
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,500
it's not about checking,

637
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,700
it's about observing.

638
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,540
Observing?

639
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,860
Here is the fruit.

640
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,820
Here is the fruit.

641
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,060
Virgin mark?

642
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,500
Look,

643
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
my virgin mark is gone!

644
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,220
Then you should go to the hospital.

645
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,240
Why are you in the boiler room?

646
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,740
Why the hospital?

647
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,980
To see a psychiatrist.

648
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,060
Come on,

649
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,140
Bai Lan, I'm serious.

650
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,660
I admit I drank too much that night,

651
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,340
but I swear, I am definitely not someone

652
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,490
who dares not take responsibility.

653
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,920
How will you take responsibility?

654
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,020
Will you invite me to dinner
or help me with work,

655
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,020
or...

656
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,940
Or what?

657
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,100
Or do it again?

658
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,340
Okay, okay.

659
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,380
Let's just forget about

660
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,300
that night.

661
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,740
It's the alcohol's fault.

662
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,260
Don't take it to heart.

663
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,420
What do you mean, don't take it to heart?

664
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,740
This was my

665
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,980
first time.

666
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,700
What?

667
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,980
You and Bai Lan...

668
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,260
Bro!

669
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,700
Lower your voice.

670
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
That old saying is right.

671
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,620
Younger generations

672
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,240
always surpass the older ones.

673
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,540
You're better than me.

674
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,420
And you're quite brave.

675
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,880
It is hard to say

676
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,920
who was the one being brave.

677
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,220
True.

678
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,140
A fierce woman like Bai Lan

679
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,980
is really hard to deal with.

680
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,220
Dajiang,

681
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,580
what should I do now?

682
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,780
Given your situation,

683
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,620
you're quite passive.

684
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,740
Then how can I
turn passivity into initiative?

685
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,820
She's just a woman.

686
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
Is it that difficult?

687
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,540
Do you really like her?

688
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,540
The key is I don't even know

689
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,540
if she likes me or not.

690
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,940
If she doesn't like you,

691
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:45,940
why did she do that with you?

692
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,140
If she likes me,

693
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,180
why say

694
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,140
"don't take it to heart"?

695
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,020
You just don't understand.

696
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
A woman's heart

697
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,180
is hard to understand.

698
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,220
Really?

699
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,660
You brat.

700
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,740
The initiative is in your hands.

701
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,700
You've been in Fucheng for so long,

702
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,730
and I've never treated you to fish balls.

703
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
This place serves my favorite fish balls.

704
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,140
When I was a child, my mom always used

705
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,060
pork belly and dried shrimp

706
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,580
to make fake fish balls for me.

707
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
It was only when

708
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,780
my cousin brought me here
for the first time

709
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,380
that I realized

710
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,220
fish balls are so delicious.

711
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,700
Fish balls are made with conger eel.

712
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,980
Actually,

713
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,540
since that night,

714
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,340
there are some things
I've wanted to tell you.

715
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,940
It's not just about taking responsibility
for what I've done,

716
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,060
but I've wanted to

717
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,260
say something for a long time.

718
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,860
You know what?

719
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,500
You're like this bowl of fish ball soup.

720
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,180
Before I met you,

721
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,300
I didn't know
there was another side to the world.

722
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,780
Yes,

723
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,660
I'm a small worker,

724
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,060
but so what?

725
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,300
I'll do my best to treat you well.

726
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,140
Bai Lan,

727
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,900
I like you.

728
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,260
Xiaolu.

729
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,340
What do you think?

730
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,300
If I were a girl,

731
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,060
I'd marry you.

732
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,140
Shut up.

733
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,260
Here.

734
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,540
It was so touching.

735
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,740
You're sure to succeed.
