Earlier, I...

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Do you still want me
to help you catch that flasher?

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
Let me tell you, no way.

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,980
Hold on a second,

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,580
I just helped you out.

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,980
Why are you turning against me now?

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,460
You don't really think

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,780
I wanted to kiss you, do you?

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,100
You've got it all wrong.

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,420
I was just helping you out.

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,820
I just had to go all the way.

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,100
Otherwise, how would you escape?

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,700
Could they really kidnap me?

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,820
Hard to say.

38
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,820
Lu Xiaolu,

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,660
I'm starting to think

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,140
you're the pervert who followed me.

41
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,300
Bai Lan, you're too full of yourself.

42
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,860
Everyone else might not know
what you're like,

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,980
but I sure do.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,300
You appear all angelic on the outside,

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,700
like a fairy come down to earth,

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,580
but in reality, you're just a scoundrel—

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
rough, cunning,

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,820
heartless,

49
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,740
and even a bit crazy.

50
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,020
Why should I follow you?

51
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,180
You know I'm a scoundrel

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,620
and still keep bothering me.

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,380
Do you believe I'd kill you with a knife?

54
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,220
I don't.

55
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,820
Because you can't beat me.

56
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
You...

57
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,720
What are you doing?

58
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,900
- Let go.
- I won't.

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,820
You...

60
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,100
You even use sneak attack!

61
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,660
Thank goodness I reacted quickly.

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,580
You...

63
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,340
You kissed me without my consent.

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,260
That's harassment.

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,020
Apologize to me.

66
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
I won't.

67
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,620
You repaid kindness with enmity

68
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,460
and attacked suddenly.

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,940
Why should I apologize to you?

70
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,260
Bai Lan, let me tell you.

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,260
In my dictionary,

72
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,980
there's no such thing as "I'm sorry"!

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,100
=Episode 3=
=Thank You, I'm Sorry for the Trouble=

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,460
Why are you venting
on an iron bar in the morning?

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,380
Lu Xiaolu.

76
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,580
Good for you.

77
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,340
You are famous already.

78
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,060
You brought honor
to our maintenance department.

79
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,620
You've really got Dr. Bai.

80
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,140
What do you mean?

81
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,660
Lu Xiaolu,

82
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,820
the Labor Department received a report

83
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,380
saying you harassed Dr. Bai.

84
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,020
Come with me
to explain to the supervisor.

85
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,420
I am innocent.

86
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
There is nothing to explain.

87
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,820
Come here.

88
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,860
Come.

89
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,220
Why

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,700
did you kiss her?

91
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,020
If you're not harassing her,

92
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,860
then

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,380
are you two together?

94
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,540
How is that possible?

95
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,460
She's such a two-faced woman.

96
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,260
I will never like her.

97
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,500
You should go explain to everyone

98
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,340
that you two...

99
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,220
No pulling and pushing during work hours.

100
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
You still know it's work hours?

101
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,060
There's a job for you.

102
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,860
- What kind of job?
- What is it?

103
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,740
The kind that'll open your eyes.

104
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,220
Dr. Bai.

105
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,460
Get out.

106
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,500
Sorry,

107
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,740
I didn't know there was a patient inside.

108
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,500
Dr. Bai, are you okay?

109
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,980
Lu Xiaolu didn't hurt you, did he?

110
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,260
This is my private matter.

111
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,220
No need to trouble you.

112
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,340
I actually have
something private to ask you.

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,700
Do you really have a boyfriend?

114
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,060
It's none of your business.

115
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,340
Looks like
this has had quite an impact on you.

116
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,780
I'll come back

117
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,690
when you're feeling better.

118
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,340
No need to see me out.

119
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,460
Secretary Bi is much better

120
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,900
than the workers at our factory.

121
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,900
He's a junior college graduate.

122
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,200
His dad is the deputy director
of the Second Light Industry Bureau.

123
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,580
You should consider it.

124
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,860
That way,
you don't need to study so hard.

125
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,380
Then why don't you go pursue him?

126
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,500
Since when do girls pursue guys?

127
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,980
Could Lu Xiaolu really like you?

128
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Impossible.

129
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,300
He was arrested because of me,

130
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,500
missed the college entrance exam,

131
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,820
lost his welding mask,

132
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,460
was suspected of being a flasher,

133
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,700
and was even forced
to fix a bicycle by me.

134
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,660
I think he's the person in the factory

135
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
who hates me the most.

136
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,380
So many things have happened
between you two.

137
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,420
I had no idea.

138
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
I don't want to talk about him.

139
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,860
Lie on your back.

140
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,900
I thought you were dead,

141
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,660
not moving for ten minutes.

142
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,260
Let's go watch a movie this weekend.

143
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,580
A movie?

144
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,820
Is there anyone worth seeing recently?

145
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,260
All's Well, Ends Well Too?

146
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,980
Fight Back to School?

147
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,740
Why is your head always
filled with such dirty thoughts?

148
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,980
Disgusting.

149
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,860
What's dirty about that?

150
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,740
I just wanted to confirm something.

151
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
Confirm what?

152
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,540
In reality,

153
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,460
why do those women wear

154
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,660
such different things

155
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
than in the movies?

156
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,900
How do you know they're different?

157
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,740
Have you seen it?

158
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,940
You pervert!

159
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,820
You are still full of dirty thoughts.

160
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
Sleep.

161
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,020
Why did you throw that at me?

162
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,180
Bai Lan.

163
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
Bai Lan.

164
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,140
Xiaolu.

165
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,220
So much food.

166
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,260
Can you finish it all?

167
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,820
He helped Xiaoying catch the pig.

168
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,300
Xiaoying gave him the food.

169
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,700
Beautiful, huh?

170
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,980
Not at all.

171
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,340
I didn't even say what I was saying.

172
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,420
Why are you looking down
if it's not beautiful?

173
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,740
I didn't sleep well last night.

174
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,820
I'm tired.

175
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,100
You didn't sleep well?

176
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,140
He had a nightmare last night,

177
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,060
scared me.

178
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,940
What kind of dream?

179
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,820
Let me interpret it for you.

180
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,500
Since when do you interpret dreams?

181
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,340
Impressive.

182
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,180
All girls in our department can do it.

183
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,420
Just for fun.

184
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,140
Xiaolu, tell me.

185
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,540
Did you dream about

186
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,780
something or someone that scares you?

187
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Kind of.

188
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,780
If so,

189
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,700
there are two types of people
you're afraid of.

190
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,860
One is someone
who will change your destiny,

191
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,540
and you're worried
about your destiny changing,

192
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,820
so you're afraid of them.

193
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,580
The other is someone

194
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,060
you love dearly,

195
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,380
and you're worried about losing them,

196
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,540
so you're afraid.

197
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,780
Which one are you?

198
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Aren't those

199
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,620
the same?

200
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,540
How could they be the same?

201
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,440
Are you even listening to me?

202
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,140
You care about the first one
and like the second.

203
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,190
- Guangnan.
- Since you like them...

204
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,950
Something's happened.

205
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,740
What happened? What's going on?

206
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,100
Come with me and you'll know,
and you too.

207
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,380
Come on, come on, hurry.

208
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,100
What's going on?

209
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,940
Wait a minute.

210
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,100
Turn that breaker back on for me.

211
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Okay.

212
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,220
Do you know why they respect your master?

213
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,740
Because he's good.

214
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,580
It's because he fixed foreign water pumps,

215
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,940
beat the workshop manager,

216
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,540
and even blew up in the sky
with the reactor once.

217
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,700
Nothing major,
maybe a loose screw inside.

218
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,940
Open this big cover for me.

219
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,300
Okay, Master.

220
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,500
- Don't do it.
- Hurry up.

221
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,540
Don't touch it.

222
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,420
This machine was imported from abroad.

223
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,740
(Ding Dezhong, Director of the Factory Office)
There's only one in Fucheng.

224
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,060
If you break it, who will be responsible?

225
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,580
I find it strange.

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,780
At this time, he shows up.

227
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,900
Ding,

228
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,900
tell me,

229
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,980
is there a machine in the factory
that I can't fix?

230
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,820
Every horse has its saddle.

231
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,300
This is a German machine.

232
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,580
We can invite a German expert to fix it.

233
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,620
Hey, Director Ding.

234
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,980
So what you're saying is

235
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,060
my master isn't qualified

236
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,580
to fix this German machine?

237
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,980
Look at him being so obsessed
with foreign things.

238
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,020
Foreigners' farts would be his perfume.

239
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,860
You...

240
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,940
Ding, when will

241
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,140
this expert arrive?

242
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,300
It might take a week.

243
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,220
A week?

244
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,940
That's too long.

245
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,460
- One long week.
- Once the production line stops,

246
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,010
one day's losses
are over a hundred thousand.

247
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,660
Waiting

248
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
for a week

249
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,540
means losing the bonus.

250
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,660
Anyway, no matter what,

251
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,580
nobody can touch it.

252
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
Hey, Ding.

253
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
What's more important,

254
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,060
the person or the machine?

255
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
I've said my piece.

256
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,300
You can touch it.

257
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,340
If you break it,

258
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,980
it's on you.

259
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,820
Master.

260
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,220
Let's go.

261
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,180
Should we talk to Master?

262
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,020
Sometimes it's better
to have fewer problems.

263
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,100
Talk to him how?

264
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,020
When has our Master

265
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,280
ever endured this kind of frustration?

266
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,640
He's about to retire, and that Ding Dezhong

267
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,070
is stomping all over him.

268
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,020
If it were me, I couldn't swallow
this insult either.

269
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,180
But the director
doesn't care about the shutdown.

270
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,900
Why rush ourselves?

271
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,820
Big Feet, you go talk to Master.

272
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,620
How can you do this to me?

273
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,620
Everyone knows
that person will get scolded.

274
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,260
Xiaolu is bold. Let him go.

275
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,620
So Xiaolu,

276
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,020
you do it.

277
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
Master,

278
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
I'll do it with you.

279
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,340
Let's do it together!

280
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,780
Count me in too.

281
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,980
You little brat,

282
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,620
look at what you've got.

283
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,300
How do we approach that?

284
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,100
There are two doors in that workshop,
one north and one south.

285
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,020
Enter from the south door,
turn right for 20 meters,

286
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,240
and you'll reach the ventilation area.

287
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,140
Enter the corridor
to reach the cold storage room

288
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,220
where the broken machine is.

289
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,980
But the security guards outside

290
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,300
the cold storage room patrol every night.

291
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,380
If we want to get in,

292
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,900
we'll need to distract the security guards.

293
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,260
Not bad, Xiaolu,

294
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,380
you've only been there twice.

295
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,380
How do you remember?

296
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,940
With my brain.

297
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,600
(Cold Storage, Corridor, Dark Hallway)
Master, will we fix it or not?

298
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,940
Just tell us about it.

299
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,980
You think you can read my mind?

300
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,180
Who said we would go?

301
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,020
No one's going.

302
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,900
Not a single person.

303
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,660
Who are you?

304
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,380
Master?

305
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,820
Didn't I tell you not to come?

306
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,820
But you came too.

307
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,660
I...

308
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,780
Anyone else?

309
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,220
Master.

310
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,460
- You all...
- Master.

311
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,180
Debao is the shiftleader.

312
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,100
If something happens to him,

313
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,860
the entire maintenance team
won't have anyone to lead.

314
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,420
So I didn't call him to come.

315
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,860
Look at you

316
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,380
making arrangements.

317
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,180
- Let's go.
- Come on.

318
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,220
Go, go, go.

319
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
Hurry.

320
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,420
Take this.

321
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,340
Someone's coming, someone's coming.

322
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,580
Over here, over here.

323
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,940
What's going on?

324
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,260
Ma! Ma!

325
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,100
There's a ghost, a ghost!

326
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,900
Why are you yelling like that?

327
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,860
Are you the ghost?

328
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,300
There really is a ghost.

329
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,460
Wearing a white robe, floating

330
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,900
with long legs.

331
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,140
What are you two waiting for?

332
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,260
Come with me.

333
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,300
You go!

334
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
Wait for me!

335
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,500
Wait for me!

336
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,020
(Security Department)
Wait for me! I'm scared!

337
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,460
People are coming.

338
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,260
Watch closely.

339
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
Big Feet,

340
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,740
please don't take it off.

341
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,500
Stop right there!

342
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,420
Hey, don't run!

343
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,940
Stop, be it ghost or human!

344
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,540
Hurry, hurry.

345
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,740
- Who are you?
- Stop running!

346
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,780
- Hurry, hurry!
- Don't run!

347
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,700
- Get him!
- Stop!

348
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,060
Stop right there!

349
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm sorry, sorry.

350
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,620
- Dr. Bai?
- Big Feet?

351
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,580
Why are you pretending to be a ghost?

352
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,540
I'm not, I'm not.

353
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,340
Caught you!

354
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,860
Dr. Bai,

355
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,140
did you see a ghost?

356
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,380
Are you talking about this?

357
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,180
You go, you go, you go.

358
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
This is ridiculous.

359
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,290
- Dr. Bai, look.
- Dr. Bai.

360
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
Master!

361
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,380
Master!

362
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,500
Did you hear?

363
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,540
There was a ghost
in the bottling workshop last night.

364
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,300
Really?

365
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,380
Where did the ghost come from?

366
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Can something like that happen?

367
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,340
Yeah, it's strange.

368
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,140
It's true,

369
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,580
and because there was a ghost last night,

370
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,780
the German machine is working now.

371
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,100
It's a shame that

372
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,660
Director Liu and Ding Dezhong
still won't let us work.

373
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,940
Why not?

374
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,420
Why do you think?

375
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,740
They insist on
waiting for that foreign expert.

376
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,020
(Warm Welcome to German Expert)

377
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,660
Do you need a hand?

378
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,020
No, I'll do it myself.

379
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,780
Okay.

380
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,180
So what do you think the problem is?

381
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,260
Is it because of the machine's engine?

382
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,540
Of course not.

383
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,980
This is not our original screw.

384
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,260
I don't know where it came from,

385
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,850
but it definitely shouldn't be here.

386
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,260
Is this not an original one?

387
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,100
No.

388
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,340
He said that this screw is not original.

389
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,940
Explain it to me.

390
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,420
Why was there a Chinese screw

391
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,700
in the German machine?

392
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,620
The German machine

393
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,300
is used in China,

394
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,380
so it's not surprising
to find a Chinese screw in it.

395
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,540
If there were an American screw,

396
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,180
that would be strange, wouldn't it?

397
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,540
Bai Lan, could you explain to him

398
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,100
what the German expert said?

399
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,260
The German expert said that

400
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,980
we cannot change machine parts
without authorization,

401
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
otherwise

402
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,030
they will no longer provide
maintenance services

403
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,020
and we will have to pay
a penalty of 100,000 yuan.

404
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,380
A hundred thousand

405
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,300
for just one screw?

406
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,420
Isn't that robbery, Director?

407
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,620
Mr. Niu,

408
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,180
I have great respect for you
after all the years

409
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,340
you've worked in the factory.

410
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,220
We should value contract

411
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,780
and honesty,

412
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,540
or nobody will work with you.

413
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,660
The factory pays me

414
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,780
and I do what I should do.

415
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,500
I don't know anything

416
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,780
about a contract.

417
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,900
I've never read it anyway.

418
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,940
Get out of the way.

419
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,020
Director,

420
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,100
we shut the machines down

421
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
just for this little screw?

422
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,100
We lost over

423
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,780
one hundred thousand a day

424
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,900
and you know that.

425
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,260
Mr. Niu,

426
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,140
you are an old employee of our factory.

427
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,740
I remember you were already here
when I entered the factory.

428
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,540
But why are you
becoming unreasonable now?

429
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
If I remember correctly,

430
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,660
you're about to turn 55 in two years,
right?

431
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,180
What are you trying to say?

432
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,020
We won't discuss who's right or wrong

433
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,340
in this matter for now,

434
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,140
but for the sake of our factory's interests,

435
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,420
we should give the Germans an explanation.

436
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,700
What explanation do you want?

437
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,580
What do you want?

438
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,580
If you want to fire me, go ahead.

439
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,740
If that's your attitude, how will we

440
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,700
- solve this matter?
- Master!

441
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,080
- Xiaolu.
- Master.

442
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,100
Lu Xiaolu,

443
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,100
why are you

444
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,140
in every trouble?

445
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,180
Director Liu,

446
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
I came up with the idea

447
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,660
to fix the machine that day,

448
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,060
I drew the topographic map,

449
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,700
and I handed the tools to my master.

450
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,380
If you want to punish someone, punish me,

451
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,260
not my master.

452
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,220
I kept watch that night.

453
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,420
I did that too.

454
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,740
Anyway,

455
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,540
my master's business is our business.

456
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,740
You can just fire us all.

457
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,140
Do you think Big Feet can do it?

458
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,480
Among the few of us,

459
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,980
he is the only one
who knows a little English.

460
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,780
- Hello.
- It has to be him.

461
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,900
Tell him

462
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,060
Mr. Niu is our master.

463
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,340
Hey, man.

464
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,260
Don't be arrogant.

465
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,100
Do you know who we are?

466
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,300
We apologize to him.

467
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,740
Believe it

468
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,020
or no believe it,

469
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,140
we can beat you down.

470
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,980
We are sincere.

471
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,460
Let you see what we are.

472
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,980
You better shut up.

473
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

474
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,420
- Lu Xiaolu.
- You better run. Beat it.

475
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,260
Come out with me.

476
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,660
- Go.
- Eat. Eat.

477
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,660
What are you doing?

478
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,660
That's also what I want to ask you.

479
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,380
I am trying to apologize to him.

480
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,500
We admit that

481
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,800
violating the contract was wrong,

482
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,020
but replacement comparison method

483
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,180
is a basic method

484
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,620
that I knew about since middle school.

485
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,180
He wouldn't even let us touch it.

486
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,980
I just want him to trust us.

487
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,820
Rules are rigid,

488
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,060
but people can not be.

489
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,620
Could you please stop causing trouble?

490
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,340
Trouble?

491
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,860
Are you also just like Bi Zhigang

492
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,940
and Ding Dezhong,

493
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,660
thinking we workers know nothing

494
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,540
but making trouble?

495
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,580
Isn't that true?

496
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,700
You sneaked into the workshop at night

497
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,040
and let Big Feet play the ghost,

498
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
and now you are
threatening the German expert.

499
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,340
Didn't you do all that?

500
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,720
How do you know about Big Feet
playing a ghost?

501
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,140
Do you think you are being a hero

502
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,020
and solving problems?

503
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,140
Let me tell you,

504
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,540
in my eyes,
you're just like a clumsy bear.

505
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,340
Master,

506
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,700
do I really

507
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,260
look like a bear?

508
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,460
Bear?

509
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,260
You are my bloodline,

510
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,340
how can you be a bear?

511
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,060
Bloodline?

512
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,020
What do you mean?

513
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,860
Your veins flow

514
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,900
with my blood.

515
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,860
Didn't your mom tell you?

516
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,700
No, no, no, Master,

517
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
you can't say things like that.

518
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,420
What do you mean my veins flow
with your blood?

519
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,380
You mean my mom...

520
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,540
You little rascal,

521
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,180
what are you thinking?

522
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,540
When you were little,

523
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,540
you fell down the stairs

524
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,620
in the factory

525
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,700
and got seriously injured.

526
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,140
We have the same blood type,

527
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,060
so I gave you a big bag of blood.

528
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,740
You scared me there,

529
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,620
you shouldn't start the story like that.

530
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,700
Drink up, Master.

531
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,340
Drink.

532
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,900
You have

533
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,980
my blood flowing in you,

534
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,980
so your temper

535
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,860
and character are just like mine

536
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,380
when I was young.

537
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,780
The day

538
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,100
you joined the maintenance team,

539
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,860
when I saw you,

540
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,100
I thought,

541
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,780
isn't this my son?

542
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,970
Mr. Niu,

543
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,060
think before you say anything!

544
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,900
If he's your son,

545
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,820
then what am I?

546
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,580
So,

547
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,100
you two can be

548
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,260
brother and sister.

549
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,100
No!

550
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,580
He can't be my brother.

551
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,540
Wait,

552
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,820
why is she angry?

553
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,860
I've been

554
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,540
in this factory

555
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,860
for over 40 years,

556
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,580
never late

557
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,260
or left early once.

558
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,380
When Xiaoying's mother passed away,

559
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
I only took half a day off.

560
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,860
There's no machine in this factory
that I can't fix.

561
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,580
With me around,

562
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,220
I'll never let the production line stop.

563
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,740
But they

564
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,420
said I'm

565
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,860
outdated

566
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
and asked me to leave.

567
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,140
I...

568
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,420
Master,

569
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,700
don't be sad.

570
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,940
You still have me.

571
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
Good.

572
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,140
Good.

573
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,020
(Gongyuan)
We are very sorry for this mistake.

574
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,700
Hope there will be opportunities
for cooperation.

575
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,820
Bye-bye.

576
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,380
Come in.

577
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,020
Secretary Bi.

578
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,420
Dr. Bai?

579
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,100
Why are you here?

580
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,660
This is for you.

581
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,300
For me?

582
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,140
Yes.

583
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,820
Didn't you say last time
that you wanted to learn English?

584
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,460
These tapes should be helpful.

585
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,740
(University English)

586
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,700
I appreciate it.

587
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
Next time, just let me know.

588
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,260
You didn't have to come personally.

589
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
I could go pick it up.

590
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,460
How about this?
I'll treat you to dinner tonight

591
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,460
as a token of thanks.

592
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,540
No need to be so formal.

593
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,180
I'm not being formal with you.

594
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,180
By the way,

595
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,300
are all the contracts
of the factory with you?

596
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,140
Yes.

597
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,540
Can I borrow the contract signed with

598
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,420
the German manufacturer?

599
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,660
I mainly want to learn

600
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,940
how English contracts are written.

601
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,820
Although my spoken English is not bad,

602
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,380
reading is quite difficult for me.

603
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,660
So, I thought I could learn a bit more.

604
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,340
It's better to be a slow learner
than not at all.

605
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,740
How can you be a slow learner?

606
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,140
You're so smart.

607
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,660
So, are you refusing to lend it to me?

608
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,220
Of course not.

609
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,340
Well, I...

610
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,500
You can't take the contract
out of this room.

611
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,580
It's a rule.

612
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,860
I'll read it here.

613
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,820
You can watch me.

614
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,940
There won't be a problem.

615
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,540
Okay, okay.

616
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,900
- Wait for me a moment.
- Sure.

617
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,140
For January and February...

618
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Wait, hey!

619
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
Wait a minute! Hey!

620
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,740
Dr. Bai!

621
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
What is this?

622
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,660
Hop on!

623
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,020
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

624
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,860
Let's go.

625
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,340
Can you go any faster?

626
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,500
Don't worry. Xiaolu will surely
hold the German expert off.

627
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,740
Dr. Smith.

628
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,780
Lan.

629
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,220
Sorry.

630
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,460
This man is crazy.

631
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,660
- Xiaolu!
- Please take me away from here.

632
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,980
I just got something
very urgent to tell you.

633
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,340
This is our contract.

634
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,540
I just read through it.

635
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,620
And seems like we were not the one
who broke it.

636
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,260
So according to it, we should

637
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
be given solutions within three days.

638
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,980
After which we can open the shell
of the machine.

639
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,820
What?

640
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,620
So your company is the one
who breached the contract first.

641
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,060
Your persistence really beat me down.

642
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,180
This is not just about persistence.

643
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,860
It's just that we have the right

644
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,700
to speak for ourselves and find out the truth.

645
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,700
Can you let me go

646
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,500
if we withdraw
our breach-of-contract claim?

647
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,180
Of course!

648
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,140
We are friends.

649
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,620
Friend.

650
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
Xiaolu...

651
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,780
Although we don't have to
compensate the Germans anymore,

652
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,900
is this your achievement?

653
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,420
It's all thanks to

654
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,060
Dr. Bai Lan.

655
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,980
However,

656
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,860
for not following
the factory's regulations

657
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,940
and repairing equipment privately,

658
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,980
I still

659
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,660
need to punish you.

660
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,180
Plus that Lu Xiaolu,

661
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,660
you three will all be punished.

662
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,980
Director,

663
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,740
are you only punishing the three of us?

664
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,940
Our master won't be punished?

665
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,420
What does this have to do with Mr. Niu?

666
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,860
He fixed the machine,

667
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,060
so let's call it even.

668
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,460
Thank you, Director. Thank you.

669
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,180
But to redeem himself,

670
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,500
Xiaolu also got injured.

671
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,940
Is this a negotiation with me?

672
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,140
No.

673
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Considering your

674
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,740
dedication to the factory,

675
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,220
just write

676
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,980
a self-criticism report each.

677
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,980
That's it?

678
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,260
You want more?

679
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,300
How about

680
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,420
you write it in another language?

681
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,540
No problem.

682
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,380
Let's go.

683
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,780
Thank you, Director.

684
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,660
Dr. Bai.

685
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,660
Stop pretending to be asleep

686
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,580
and get up.

687
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,340
If you keep sleeping,
you'll really be a bear.

688
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
I'm warning you,

689
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,460
don't call me a bear again.

690
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,940
Didn't you see

691
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,860
how cool and stylish I looked

692
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,380
in that windbreaker?

693
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,060
Yeah, you did look cool,

694
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,300
like a kid

695
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,220
wearing adult clothes.

696
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
But what you did

697
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,020
was quite manly.

698
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,620
(Gongyuan)

699
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,460
What are you doing?

700
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
- Master.
- Master.

701
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,300
When I'm not around,

702
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,940
no one's working?

703
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,500
No, we were just waiting
to welcome you back.

704
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,820
Glib-tongued.

705
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,900
Big Feet,

706
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,340
sing a song to celebrate!

707
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,740
You can sing, Big Feet?

708
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,580
Oh.

709
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,020
You didn't know?

710
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,260
Big Feet is the most famous

711
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,700
singer in our factory.

712
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,460
No, no, I really can't sing.

713
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,580
I really can't.

714
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,580
Set sail!

715
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,660
Depart!

716
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,540
