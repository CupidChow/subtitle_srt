- Dajiang.

- Let's go. Hurry.
- Let's get out of here.

Impressive, Lu Dajiang.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,570
Even with a limp, you run so fast.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
You're killing me.

56
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,010
Keep it up, huh?

57
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,130
Keep clashing with the factory.

58
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm telling you.

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,490
You've killed a man.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
You're done for!

61
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,400
I've been a hero all my life.

62
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,930
Never thought I'd die at the hands
of a bug like you.

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Bug?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,050
You sent my son
to the mental institution.

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,050
Do you think
I'd let you get away with it?

66
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,810
Keep running.

67
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,630
How is it?

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,610
Did he break a bone?

69
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,400
It doesn't look good.

70
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,870
He needs to go to the hospital right now.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
No way.

72
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,130
Going to the hospital now

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,370
would be walking into a trap.

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,710
But he's bleeding too much.

75
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,160
He needs to take care of it right away.

76
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,280
I'm fine. I won't die.

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
Stay here.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,450
I'll go to the infirmary.

79
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,730
- What for?
- I'm getting medical supplies.

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Tell me what you need.

81
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,200
Can't you be rational?

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,520
I can't watch my cousin go to jail.

83
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,510
Wait for me.

84
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,990
Lu Xiaolu!

85
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,130
Wait for me to come back!

(Gongyuan)

87
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,010
Sooner or later, you'll get caught.

88
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,990
You'll end up in jail.

89
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,590
You might as well turn yourself in now.

90
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,630
You might get a lighter sentence.

91
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,030
If it were you, what would you choose?

92
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,910
I would never be as stupid as you

93
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,970
and end up like this.

94
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,960
Even if I had to die in the wilderness,

95
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
I wouldn't go to jail.

96
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,840
At worst, I'll go to Hong Kong

97
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,200
and never come back.

98
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
What about Xiaolu?

99
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,630
What will happen to him?

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,230
That's between me and him.

101
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,070
It's none of your business.

102
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,890
Xiaolu's business is my business.

103
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,450
He's so young, so talented.

104
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,130
He has a bright future.
I can't let you ruin him.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,870
Dajiang!

106
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,010
I'm back, Dajiang.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,040
Dajiang!

108
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Dajiang!

Bai Lan!

110
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,070
- Let's go.
- Wu.

111
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,670
- Thank you.
- That's it.

112
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,010
I'll keep you posted if anything happens.

113
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,680
- Wu.
- Okay.

114
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,840
I heard you've been
looking for me everywhere.

115
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,870
Lu Dajiang.

116
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
No need to bother.

117
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,680
I've come myself.

119
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Xiaolu,

120
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,310
don't be sad.

121
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,530
If something really happens to Dajiang,

122
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,440
we'll seek justice together.

123
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,010
What justice is there to speak of?

124
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,310
Wait a minute.

125
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,830
Well,

126
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,160
I have a letter for you.

127
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,970
I thought about it for a long time,
and I shouldn't keep it from you.

128
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,890
Here, take it.

129
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,920
It's not my fault.

130
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,130
Bai Lan didn't want it.

131
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,330
Dear Xiaolu,

132
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,190
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,970
This is the most important

134
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,920
and the hardest decision

135
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,930
of my life so far.

136
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,540
But in your eyes,

137
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,180
it might seem the most selfish one.

138
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,540
I've been lucky to meet you

139
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,660
during my days in Fucheng.

140
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,780
Thank you for everything
you've brought to me.

141
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,420
You've lit up my dreams.

142
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,500
Everyone dreams.

143
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,660
What's in your dream?

144
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,900
Do I appear in it?

145
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Of course,

146
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,940
you are

147
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,300
in my dreams too.

148
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,380
But there's a slight difference.

149
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,180
In my dream,

150
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
we're not under the chimneys
of the food factory,

151
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,820
but by the Huangpu River.

152
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,220
Fucheng is your hometown.

153
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,300
You love this place.

154
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,660
You're attached to it.

155
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,140
I'm even a bit jealous

156
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,900
that you have a place to miss

157
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,660
and long for.

158
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,340
But I haven't found

159
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,540
such a place worth staying for myself.

160
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,020
So, I must keep moving.

161
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,580
I didn't come to Fucheng for you.

162
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,820
I came here to leave.

163
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
That was my plan

164
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,060
from the day I arrived.

165
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,660
Please forgive me

166
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,060
for not being able to change my dream

167
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,500
and my steadfast path for you.

168
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,540
Xiaolu,

169
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,060
are you alright?

170
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,860
Don't be like this.

171
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,500
I know it's hard for you.

172
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,380
What exactly happened that night?

173
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,060
How did my cousin get taken away?

174
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,940
Why couldn't you
wait for me to come back?

176
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,030
You went to work as a translator
at the Second Light Industry Bureau

177
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,180
just to get a sponsored position, right?

178
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,900
You've always wanted to leave Fucheng,

179
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,140
but you kept it from me.

180
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,700
I wish you all the best

181
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,540
and a bright future.

182
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,820
Xiaolu,

183
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,020
pass me the file.

184
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,580
Master,

185
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
you forgot

186
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,560
that Xiaolu hasn't been here
for several days.

187
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,180
Mr. Ding,

188
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,460
what brings you here?

189
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,140
Where's Lu Xiaolu?

190
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,180
Ding,

191
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,900
your head is wounded,

192
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,130
yet you're still looking for trouble.

193
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,220
Lu Xiaolu and his cousin gathered a crowd

194
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,620
to beat people.

195
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,980
If I see him,

196
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,540
I'll kick him out right away.

197
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,820
Don't scare me.

198
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,820
Whether my apprentice stays or goes
is up to me.

199
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,820
What you said

200
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,140
is just nonsense.

201
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,220
What are you doing?

202
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,380
A bunch of savages.

203
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,580
I won't stoop to your level.

204
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,660
You...

205
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,510
Master, this...

206
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,980
Look at him.

207
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,460
Master,

208
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,340
Dajiang is so capable,

209
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,940
yet he ended up in prison.

210
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,460
Xiaolu must be really upset.

211
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,820
Get to work.

212
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,940
You're finally back.

213
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,030
Uncle's situation is troublesome.

214
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,340
Right, Juan.

215
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,340
Do me a favor.

216
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,820
Give this to Xiaolu for me.

217
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,060
You're asking for my help?

218
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,860
What is it?

219
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,580
A joke book?

220
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,300
After Lu Dajiang's incident,

221
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,740
Xiaolu has been feeling quite down.

222
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,180
I was thinking about
how to cheer him up.

223
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,380
No, I...

224
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,260
I never thought

225
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,700
you'd do something so childish.

226
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,620
Childish?

227
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,820
I think it's pretty good.

228
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,220
Very childish.

229
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,500
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

230
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,940
I don't want to see him.

231
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,180
And I wouldn't know what to say if I did.

232
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,180
Alright then.

233
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,580
By the way,

234
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,660
can you cook?

235
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,460
A little.

236
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Then teach me how to cook.

237
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,540
Sure.

238
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,740
What do you want to learn?

239
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,900
Fishball soup.

240
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,620
Fishball soup?

241
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,780
And

242
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,780
something with beef.

243
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,740
There's a lot of seafood here.

244
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,780
So what should we make?

245
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,980
How about clam soup?

246
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,820
It moistens and cools.

247
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
These are razor clams, not clams.

248
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,140
Alright, let's go.

249
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,580
Thank you for agreeing to teach me.

250
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,740
This one isn't sweet.

251
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,180
This kind is sweet.

252
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,220
You don't have to thank me.

253
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,300
My uncle and aunt

254
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,180
treated you badly before

255
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,740
and even sent you down
to the boiler room.

256
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,700
You should hate me.

257
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,260
That way, I'd feel more at ease.

258
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,460
Didn't you hate me before too?

259
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,980
We're even now.

260
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,980
I disliked you before

261
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,700
because I liked Lu Xiaolu.

262
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,380
So, you don't like him now?

263
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,860
I just think he's actually
not that handsome.

264
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,060
He's childish and self-centered,

265
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,700
and he always does

266
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,100
weird things.

267
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,980
That's annoying.

268
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,020
I think there must be someone else

269
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,940
in this world worth liking.

270
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,540
Someone else?

271
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,140
Like Li Guangnan?

272
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,220
I didn't say him.

273
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,540
Actually, Xiaolu's mom

274
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,140
and Xiaoying are both pretty good cooks.

275
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,460
Why don't you ask them for help?

276
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,780
I just want to make something
for him myself.

277
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,980
Ah, of course.

278
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,540
If I were you,

279
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,900
and the person I like was in such a state,

280
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,030
I wouldn't be able to leave in peace.

281
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,460
This one is Chinese style.

282
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,700
Mine is Western style.

283
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,460
This one has three dishes and one soup,

284
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,350
with a full range of flavors.

285
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,380
Mine has a nutritionally balanced mix
of meat and vegetables.

286
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,700
These are all Xiaolu's favorite dishes.

287
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,700
I deliver them to him every day,

288
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,020
and he always eats them all up.

289
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,140
When have I ever eaten all of it?

290
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,100
He... He definitely doesn't always

291
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,180
eat it all up, right?

292
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,500
Sometimes when he leaves a bit,

293
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,060
I help him finish a couple of bites,

294
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
right, Xiaolu?

295
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,740
Yes.

296
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,300
Hey, please

297
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,180
don't bring me food again.

298
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,420
Don't come to see me anymore.

299
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
I'm fine at home,

300
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,300
eating well and sleeping well.

301
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,540
Stop worrying unnecessarily.

302
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,300
Then why aren't you coming to work?

303
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,020
Yeah, everyone is worried about you.

304
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,060
Is it because of Dajiang?

305
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,060
And Bai Lan.

306
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,060
Hey, Xiaoying.

307
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,660
Alright, stop worrying unnecessarily.

308
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,820
I just want to be alone at home for a bit.

309
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,860
I'll be back in a few days.

310
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,020
Don't worry.

311
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,460
Then come back soon.

312
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,540
We're waiting for you.

313
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,980
Let us know if you need anything.

314
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,220
Alright.

315
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,700
Well, we're leaving then.

316
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,540
Let's go. I'll see you out.

317
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,060
- Remember to eat.
- Have your meals.

318
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,380
- Eat mine.
- You guys focus on work.

319
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,220
Stop coming to see me.

320
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,020
Go.

321
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
Don't worry.

322
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,820
Having known Xiaolu for so many years,

323
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,100
always bustling and bustling,

324
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,500
I've never seen him this quiet.

325
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,740
Right. He says he's fine,

326
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,060
but he's lost a lot of weight.

327
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,820
It's your fault.

328
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,730
What are you doing here
with your lousy cooking skills?

329
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,980
If it weren't for you,
Xiaolu would have eaten mine long ago.

330
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
What do you mean?

331
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,860
Is it only you
who can care about Xiaolu?

332
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,460
You're hanging on to Li Guangnan

333
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,540
and still care about Xiaolu.

334
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,380
Aren't you ashamed?

335
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,220
What? Come on.

336
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,540
I don't need to explain to you.

337
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,660
Whatever!

338
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,300
She's crazy!

339
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,460
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

340
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,820
Maybe he just wasn't feeling well today.

341
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,900
But I gave him his favorite dishes.

342
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,140
Is your information wrong?

343
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
No.

344
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,100
It can't be.

345
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,900
Think about it.
Eating the same thing for months,

346
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,580
he must get tired of it,

347
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,420
right?

348
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,820
Isn't he coming back in a few days?

349
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,940
You have a couple of days

350
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,860
to think about the recipes, right?

351
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,140
(Safe and Civilized Community)

352
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,980
That makes sense.

353
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,740
What should I add then?

354
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,160
Roast chicken with crispy skin.

355
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,420
No, that won't do.

356
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,780
Fried pork with vinegar.

357
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,700
Oh wait, he likes sweet things.

358
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,140
Still thinking about your cousin, huh?

359
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,700
Ever since I was little,

360
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,400
I've always thought my cousin

361
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,460
was the most incredible person
in the world.

362
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,260
As long as I was behind him,

363
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,540
nobody dared to bully me.

364
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Although

365
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,180
he wasn't well-educated,

366
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,220
not particularly handsome,

367
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,900
and sometimes not the sharpest,

368
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,700
in my heart,

369
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,740
he has always been a hero.

370
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
So what?

371
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,900
Now your cousin isn't a hero?

372
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,700
When heroes defeat villains,

373
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,220
shouldn't they have a happy ending?

374
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,940
My cousin caught the stalker

375
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,780
and gave Li Guangnan a spot

376
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,540
to sell milk tea.

377
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,220
He did so many good things.

378
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,020
Why did it end up like this?

379
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,460
Was he wrong in the first place?

380
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,820
Xiaolu,

381
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,740
have you ever thought

382
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,860
about why your cousin gave you this coat?

383
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,700
He said I looked like Boss Ma in it

384
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,800
and that it could help me win Bai Lan.

385
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,660
Did Boss Ma have a happy ending?

386
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,220
Even so,

387
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,940
aren't there still many people

388
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,140
who want to be like Boss Ma?

389
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,220
Aren't there countless heroes?

390
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,700
Time for dinner.

391
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,060
Stop chatting. Let's eat.

392
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,220
Mom, Dad,

393
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,420
I need to go somewhere.

394
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,220
(Billing of Hospitalization)

395
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,140
Hello,

396
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,220
is there a patient named Zhao Dabao here?

397
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,860
The one with the head injury?

398
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,700
Yes, right.

399
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,300
Oh, the room at the end of the hallway.

400
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,020
Thank you.

401
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,740
(Neurosurgery, Ward 18)

402
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,020
Hello,

403
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,460
are you related to Zhao Dabao?

404
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Who are you?

405
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,210
I'm Lu Xiaolu.

406
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,600
Lu Dajiang is my cousin.

407
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,220
I came to check on Zhao Dabao for him.

408
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,500
Get out!

409
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,700
Get out!

410
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,940
Get out of here!

411
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,620
All of the Lus are murderers!

412
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,700
You're sorry?

414
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,060
My son is only 20.

415
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,460
His head was smashed by you guys.

416
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,780
Now he can't even hear.

417
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,620
What will he do in the future?

418
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,180
You all are murderers!

419
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,980
- Mrs. Zhao...
- Murderer!

420
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,780
Xiaolu.

421
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,900
What are you doing here?

422
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,060
I heard from the nurse

423
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,300
you've been staying with him.

424
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,660
You even helped find the ward.

425
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,020
I'm a doctor, after all.

426
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,380
I can take care of him better than others.

427
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

428
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,940
You don't need to thank me.

429
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,660
It was your cousin
who asked me to do this before he left.

430
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,940
He's a good person.

431
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,620
You don't need to apologize.

432
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,420
I was too impulsive that day.

433
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,780
And I know

434
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,560
you meant well for my cousin.

435
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,220
I also know

436
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
you have your pursuits.

437
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,500
Though, I...

438
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,180
Let's not talk about this now.

439
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,060
When did we become
so formal with each other?

440
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,540
So, how about you?

441
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,660
How have you been recently?

442
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
Me?

443
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,980
I'm doing quite well.

444
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,980
Everyone's been really nice to me.

445
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,020
Li Guangnan helped me take leave.

446
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,420
Big Feet helped me with my work.

447
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,460
Xiaoying sometimes brings me meals.

448
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,500
But Little Pouter...

449
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,620
She's been acting strange.

450
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,100
What's wrong with her?

451
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,700
She used to be a little princess
who couldn't cook.

452
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,860
Suddenly, she's cooking for me,

453
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,100
bringing me burnt steak

454
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,460
or undercooked vegetables.

455
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,820
Do you think she's doing it on purpose

456
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,140
and trying to give me diarrhea?

457
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,380
Oh, and also,

458
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,780
she keeps cutting

459
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,460
jokes from magazines out for me.

460
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,980
But those jokes...

461
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,380
Aren't they funny?

462
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,740
They're from the Reader's Digest.

463
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,980
Do you think those are funny?

464
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,620
They're worse than the jokes
my high school principal used to tell.

465
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,700
If I have that much spare time,

466
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,090
I might as well
go back to the repair class

467
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,420
and listen to Mr. Niu tell me jokes.

468
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,500
Now that's fun.

469
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,340
What's wrong?

470
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,900
Are you upset?

471
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,380
You're Lu Xiaolu,

472
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,660
and you're Bai Lan?

473
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,180
Why is it always you two?

474
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,140
Come with us then.

475
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,420
On the night of the fight
at the skating rink,

476
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,580
where were you?

477
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,180
I was in the food factory's infirmary.

478
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,780
Who were you with?

479
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,020
By myself.

480
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,260
Can anyone vouch for that?

481
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,700
What's the matter, officer?

482
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,060
Be serious.

483
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,420
Ding Dezhong
from your factory reported

484
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,060
that someone attacked him that night.

485
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,790
(Severe Punishment to Resistors)
According to his clues,

486
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,060
the suspect who attacked him

487
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,660
is between you and Bai Lan.

488
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,540
That night I indeed
was at the food factory.

489
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,500
Dr. Tian went home
to celebrate his wife's birthday.

490
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,700
He asked me to cover his shift.

491
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,060
That's all?

492
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,980
After 10:30 pm,

493
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,820
I went out.

494
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,540
Where did you go?

495
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,980
Near the skating rink.

496
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,100
What were you doing there?

497
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,980
Here's the thing.

498
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,940
Ding Dezhong
had a grudge against my cousin.

499
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,940
We heard

500
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,000
that the infirmary
received a notice from the factory

501
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
that someone must be on duty that night.

502
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,830
We were worried something might happen
at the skating rink,

503
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
so we tried to go and stop it.

504
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,260
But we were too late.

505
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,860
When we arrived,

506
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,380
we saw Ding Dezhong attacking my cousin
with an electric baton.

507
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,420
So you grabbed a stick

508
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,660
and hit Ding Dezhong first, right?

509
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,140
I was the one who hit him.

510
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,420
You hit him?

511
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,500
Yes.

512
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,180
But it was self-defense.

513
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,180
What?

514
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,460
You don't believe me?

515
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,260
If you don't believe me,
you can check my record.

516
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,220
When I graduated from college,

517
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,460
I got in trouble for assault.

518
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,180
Just ten minutes ago,

519
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,220
Lu Xiaolu just admitted

520
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,980
he was the one
who attacked Ding Dezhong.

521
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,180
Young man,

522
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
you need to think this through.

523
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,620
Crimes can't be admitted to carelessly.

524
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,500
Once you're charged,

525
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,420
you'll be fired from the factory.

526
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,980
I know that.

527
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,700
If it wasn't me, I wouldn't admit it.

528
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,030
Everyone should be responsible
for their own actions.

529
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,700
This has nothing to do with Bai Lan.

530
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,780
Let her go.

531
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
From the motives and capabilities,

532
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,060
Lu Xiaolu's suspicion

533
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,140
is indeed much greater than yours.

534
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,740
Comrade Bai Lan,

535
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,940
think about it again.

536
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
If you have no objections

537
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,140
to Lu Xiaolu's confession,

538
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,540
you can sign here.

539
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,540
But officer,

540
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,740
isn't this supposed to be about evidence?

541
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,500
How can you calculate probabilities?

542
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,060
You're educating me now?

543
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,260
Since you're a college graduate,

544
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,020
you should know the consequences

545
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,280
of fighting and injuring someone.

546
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,420
If it's serious, you could end up in jail.

547
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,540
It's precisely because
I know the consequences

548
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,980
that I can't wrongfully
accuse a good person.

549
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,700
But every word I say is the truth.

550
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,700
I've handled many cases,

551
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,180
but this is the first time
I've seen someone

552
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,140
eager to confess to a crime.

553
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,460
Then you both better think it over again.

554
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,060
When you figure it out,

555
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,700
we'll release one of you.

556
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,180
This girl is really tough.

557
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,540
She didn't eat a thing we sent in.

558
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Not a bite

559
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,300
all day.

560
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,100
Good for you.

561
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,260
Director Bi,

562
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,060
I really didn't expect you to show up.

563
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,900
We haven't known each other long,

564
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
but

565
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,780
I really admire you.

566
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,420
When I saw you,

567
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,540
I felt an immediate connection.

568
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,460
You're particularly like my...

569
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,220
Daughter?

570
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,940
Do I really look that old?

571
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,460
I think I'd better
ask the questions clearly

572
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,430
before I start eating.

573
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,620
Why exactly are you helping me?

574
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,380
You want the truth, right?

575
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,540
Alright, I'll be straightforward.

576
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,620
It's strange,

577
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,780
but I can't stand to see you get wronged.

578
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,540
I felt like I should come over.

579
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,220
You need someone to protect you,

580
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,740
and to believe in you.

581
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,980
What if I told you

582
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,700
you believed the wrong person,

583
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,900
and the one who hit him was indeed me,

584
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,060
not someone else?

585
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,620
To me,

586
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,220
that doesn't matter.

587
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,420
This seafood porridge

588
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,900
is a dish from our hometown.

589
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,700
With some ginger,

590
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,740
it removes the fishiness

591
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,620
and warms the body.

592
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,340
Here.

593
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,020
Have some.

594
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,420
Actually,

595
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,060
I didn't specifically

596
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,180
invite you here.

597
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,620
I've been

598
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,700
having dinner here lately.

599
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,660
I...

600
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,620
couldn't find anyone to talk to
about my feelings.

601
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,460
I'm sick

602
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,980
of those official receptions.

603
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,700
My son has grown up,

604
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,060
and he always avoids me.

605
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,900
His mother...

606
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,460
We

607
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,140
don't have anything in common anymore.

608
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,700
Now we're going through a divorce.

609
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,140
It's been a while.

610
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,540
Enough about that.

611
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,900
I just think you're particularly

612
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,220
like the outstanding female classmates
I had in college.

613
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,620
Smart,

614
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,780
beautiful,

615
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,860
elegant, and graceful.

616
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
You have a real personality.

617
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Honestly, meeting you makes me

618
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
feel like

619
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,620
my life was reignited,

620
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
full of energy.

621
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,460
Bai Lan,

622
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,020
I really hope

623
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,140
you could be the one to have dinner
with me in the future.

624
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,020
With just one word from me,

625
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,180
this sponsored position

626
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,340
is yours.

627
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
You mean

628
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,500
I have to sleep with you.

629
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,340
Don't make it sound so unpleasant.

630
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,180
You...

631
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,220
Actually,

632
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,940
I also really like Shanghai.

633
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,940
I could go to Shanghai to see you.

634
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,820
We could walk on the Bund together

635
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,660
and eat at the Peace Hotel.

636
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,460
None of that matters.

637
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,060
What's important is

638
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,580
I can protect you

639
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,420
and your friend.

640
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,340
How would you protect us?

641
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,380
If you agree,

642
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,140
your friend

643
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,460
can walk out of the police station

644
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,940
safe and sound tomorrow.

645
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,620
(Good Cat Restaurant)

646
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,540
I just had a shower.

647
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,140
No, you just came out of the station.

648
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,180
You gotta wash off properly.

649
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,740
Otherwise, bad luck will stick to you.

650
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,420
Careful, careful.

651
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,900
Here comes the brasier.

652
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,580
Come on, jump over it.

653
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,660
Isn't that a bit too much?

654
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,820
- Hurry.
- Can't skip the ritual.

655
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,740
- Jump over.
- Jump.

656
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,740
Let's go, come on.

657
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,300
Come on, let's have one. Come on.

658
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,140
- Cheers.
- Come on.

659
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,340
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

660
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,300
Tell us.

661
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,780
What did you say to them?

662
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,380
How did they let you out?

663
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,940
I don't know what happened.

664
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Suddenly, they just dropped it.

665
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,180
Could it be

666
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,500
someone changed his mind?

667
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,580
Ding Dezhong isn't that kind-hearted.

668
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,060
Little Pouter.

669
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
You just called your uncle
by his full name.

670
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,620
Are you guys crazy?

671
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,060
No, no.

672
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,300
Could it be

673
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,300
Bai Lan took all the blame

674
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,500
on herself?

675
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,540
Right, where is Bai Lan?

676
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm here.

677
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,940
Hey, Bai Lan.

678
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,140
Come here.

679
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,980
Come and sit by me.

680
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,060
Come on.

681
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,460
Let's have a toast.

682
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,500
To celebrate our exoneration.

683
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,460
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

684
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,660
Congratulations.

685
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,500
Honestly,

686
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,900
I should thank you.

687
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,620
You saved my cousin.

688
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,460
What's there to thank for?

689
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,420
Anyway, it was me who hit him.

690
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,060
I'll toast to everyone.

691
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,500
Actually, I came today

692
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,660
to say goodbye.

693
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,580
I'm planning to leave the food factory.

694
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,180
What do you mean?

695
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,740
Attention, all factory workers.

696
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
Due to provocation

697
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,060
and intentional injury,

698
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,240
with multiple charges combined,

699
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,300
the former worker Lu Dajiang

700
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,460
(Notification)
was sentenced to five years

701
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,660
in prison.

702
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,880
Justice is extensive and meticulous,

703
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,940
and it spares no one.

704
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,740
Let this serve as a reminder to all staff

705
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,940
and officials in our factory.

706
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,500
Take this as a warning.

707
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,180
Those who play with fire
will eventually get burned.

708
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,060
Additionally,

709
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,460
Lu Xiaolu, a worker at the repair class,

710
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,460
has not only been absent multiple times,

711
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,860
violating factory regulations,

712
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,660
but has also been involved

713
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,420
in Lu Dajiang's illegal activities.

714
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,380
Wasn't Xiaolu caught

715
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,620
along with Bai Lan?

716
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,980
How come only Xiaolu is being punished?

717
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,340
Bai Lan is unscathed.

718
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,460
She's not demoted but promoted.

719
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,820
What does that mean?

720
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,820
Yes.

721
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,260
As for the sponsored position,

722
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,700
the entire Second Light Industry Bureau

723
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,580
only has one slot per year.

724
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
And a fine of 200 yuan...

725
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,860
What does this tell us?

726
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,300
What?

727
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,980
It shows Dr. Bai has her tactics.

728
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,540
What kind of brilliant tactics could it be?

729
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,100
Xiaolu was so good to her,

730
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,260
yet she climbed up by stepping on him.

731
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,980
How can Xiaolu
help her to go to Shanghai?

732
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,780
It might not be that simple.

733
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,300
Let's not talk about it anymore.
We'd better go.

734
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,580
Let's go.

735
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,780
Let's go.

736
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,980
This kid...

737
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,820
He's so mad.

738
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,860
Really?

739
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,940
Such a loyal friend.
