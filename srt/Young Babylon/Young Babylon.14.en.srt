25
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,230
Professor Wang,

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,580
thank you for accepting me.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,380
You don't need to thank me.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,940
This is the result of your hard work.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,660
Moreover, with your work experience

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,860
in a state-owned factory,

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,900
you surely have a deeper understanding

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,420
of the urgent need
for economic system reform.

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,860
After the semester begins,

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,980
I hope you can engage in

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,720
more discussions with your classmates
on this topic.

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,660
I believe

37
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,460
you have a bright future ahead.

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,500
No problem.

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,940
Since I am able to return to campus,

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,860
I will cherish this opportunity.

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,060
The semester hasn't started yet,

42
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,470
and the dormitories
haven't been assigned.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,220
Where are you staying?

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,460
I've rented a small place.

45
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,620
I want to get into study mode
as soon as possible.

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,340
Are you eager
to experience the atmosphere

47
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,780
of this big city, Shanghai?

48
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,220
Oh, by the way,

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,820
I heard from the admissions office that

50
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,500
your file hasn't arrived yet.

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,420
The semester is about to start.

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,980
Make a call and ask about it.

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,020
Don't let it be a trouble.

54
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,940
Really?

55
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,660

I hope you can study hard here

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,860
and get good scores.

61
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,630
(Public Telephone)
They haven't received the files?

62
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,740
How is that possible?

63
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,860
Every year, the files are sent out

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,700
from the factory months in advance.

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,300
Is it stuck somewhere?

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,640
You have a cadre status,

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,140
so it's not handled
by our Labor Department

68
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,200
but the Administration Office.

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,220
You know that.

70
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,220
But I'll start school next Monday.

71
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,820
Can you ask again for me?

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,220
Okay, okay, don't worry.

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,580
I'll ask my uncle later

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,460
and call you when I have news.

75
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,300
Okay.

76
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,580
Yeah.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,860
Xiaolu?

78
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,380
There's a problem?

79
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,980
Bai Lan's personnel file
hasn't been received.

80
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,540
Didn't you say

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,940
you wouldn't be involved

82
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,180
in her affairs
after she went to Shanghai?

83
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,540
Did I say that?

84
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,300
Yes.

85
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
I forgot.

- What are you...
- Uncle Ma.

89

Let me in.

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
This isn't your concern.

91

I...

92
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,340
You need to calm down.

93
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,820
Let me tell you,

94
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,540
Director Ding said it was sent out,

95
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,860
so it must have been sent.

96
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,180
Why would we lie to you?

97
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,060
You wouldn't lie to me,

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,220
but Ding Dezhong might.

99
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,340
Hey,

100
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Xiaolu.

101
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,220
You're still part of the factory.

102
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,900
I'm not from now on.

103
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,620

106
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,460
Outrageous!

107
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,100
Absolutely outrageous!

108
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,260
Secretary Hong, look at this.

109
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,780
Look at what he's done to my office.

110
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,020
Ma, shouldn't we call the police?

111
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,220
That's enough.

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,460
Lu Xiaolu.

113
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,660
What are you doing?

114
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Secretary Hong, let me ask you.

115
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,220
Did the factory allocate a spot
for someone to go to college?

116
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,060
Yes, why?

117
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,500
Bai Lan got into graduate school.

118
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,140
Did the factory agree to let her go?

119
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
No problem.

120
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,980
Do you think that

121
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,620
as a secretary, I would go back

122
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,620
on my word?

123
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,740
You wouldn't go back on your word,

124
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,260
but someone might.

125
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,660
Bai Lan is about
to start school in Shanghai,

126
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,780
and the school
still hasn't received her file.

127
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,140
Can you tell me why this is happening?

128
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,820
This is under
the Administration Office's jurisdiction.

129
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,260
Director Ding,

130
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,060
do you know what's going on?

131
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,700
How would I know?

132
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,140
You don't know?

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,940
Okay.

134
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,780
You said you sent it out,

135
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,720
show me the registered mail receipt.

136
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,340
I don't keep that kind of thing around,

137
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,700
I don't know where I put it.

138
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,540
Is that so?

139
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
- Of course.
- Feeling guilty?

140
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,420
Lu Xiaolu,

141
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
let me tell you,

142
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,260
stop trying to slander me.

143
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,340
I have better things to do.

144
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,020
Why would I keep Bai Lan's file?

Is this the Golden Peacock Food Factory?

146
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,520
Could you please transfer me
to the Administrative Office?

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,500
Secretary Hong,

148
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
I dare to bet with you that

149
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,660
the file is right in this drawer.

150
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,860
Do you believe it or not?

151
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,980
Can't I even take a call?

152
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,340
If I can't get the file today,

153
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,300
no one can do anything!

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,140

Could you please transfer me
to the Administrative Office?

156
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,900
Director Ding,

157
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,660
open the cabinet

158
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,580
and let him see.

159
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,620
Secretary Hong, I don't have the key.

160
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,530
No need to trouble yourself.

- Xiaolu!

165
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,460
stop making things difficult
for Director Ding.

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,940
Apologize to Director Ding

167
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,580
and let's just move on from this.

168
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,820
Apologize and move on?

169
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,460
Secretary Hong, you can't let him
get away with this.

170
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,820
Look at how
he's made a mess of my office.

171

end up with you?

182
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,740
Ding Dezhong gave it to my dad.

183
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,580
I stole it from his office.

Why are you helping me?

185
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,020
I am not helping you

but Bai Lan.

187
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,860
I remember you slapped Bai Lan

188
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,140
because of your dad.

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,940
(Good food at a low price,
long live delicious food)

190
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,820
You know,

191
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,740
everyone envies me because

192
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,220
I'm the son of a deputy

193
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,020
factory director.

194
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,020
And then?

195
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,180
So what?

196
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,380
The person I envy and am jealous of

197
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,460
the most

198
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,740
is you.

199
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,500
Your cousin loves you.

200
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,820
Bai Lan loves you.

201
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,140
Your parents also love you.

202
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,700
You can be yourself.

203
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,540
You...

204
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,340
You can do whatever you want.

205
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,300
What about me?

206
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,820
I've been forced to follow my father's lead
since I was a kid.

207
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,460
Follow my father's lead!

208
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,340
Follow my father's lead!

209
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,540
But you know what he did.

210
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,580
You saw it.

211
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,500
Hey, I don't even know...

212
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
I just wanted to know

213
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,620
what it's like to be self-willed.

214
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,780
I also want to try

215
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,300
to follow my heart.

216
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,180
This,

217
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,060
this thing,

218
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,180
is my first try.

219
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,380
In a few days,

220
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,180
I'll be transferred away
from the food factory.

221
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,420
Farewell.

222
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,300
In my opinion,

223
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,660
they both deserve it.

224
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,660
That's right.

225
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,300
If Deputy Director Bi can do such things,

226
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,900
how much better can his son be?

227
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,780
I think Secretary Bi is pretty good.

228
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,460
Good looks,

229
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
education,

230
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
and taste.

231
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,860
Although he didn't win Bai Lan over,

232
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,700
he truly loves her.

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,460
This is called deep affection.

234
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,740
Deep affection?

235
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,820
So you just said I'm good, right?

236
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,140
Then how about I marry you tomorrow?

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,860
Marry her?

238
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,300
Are you crazy? You are drunk!

239
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,620
(Welcome New Students)

240
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,460
Miss.

241
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,380
Hey, Miss.

242
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,020
Please wake up.

243
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,660
Why are you sleeping here?

244
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,340
Ma'am, you're finally back.

245
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,940
Hello, I'm Bai Lan.

246
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,100
I have something very important

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,140
to talk to you.

248
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,780
Because I don't have
your contact information,

249
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,700
I've been waiting here

250
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,820
since yesterday afternoon.

251
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,020
It's okay, take your time.

252
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,820
Please listen, my file
still hasn't been delivered,

253
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,540
but could you please
make an exception for me

254
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,100
and give me a little more time?

255
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,980
This is really important

256
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,860
for me.

257
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,180
Although I know it's against
the standard procedure.

258
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,260
The school has rules, you know.

259
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,300
Our school has already made
all the schedules

260
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,780
open to the whole society.

261
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
It's impossible to make an exception
for just one person.

262
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,500
But could you be a little flexible?

263
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,020
I've put in a lot of effort

264
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,780
to pursue this master's degree.

265
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,460
By 5:00 this afternoon,

266
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,460
we need to enter

267
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
all the new students' files.

268
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
If you can't get it here by then,

269
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,180
I might not be able to help you.

270
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,460
Can't you give me a bit more time?

271
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,620
If you can't make it this year,

272
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,660
why not try again next year?

273
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,900
Our school welcomes every student
who strives for progress.

274
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,420
- But...
- Sorry, I need to take this call.

275
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,020
Hey, Miss!

276
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,580
Miss!

277
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,740
Wait a moment.

278
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,620
The receiving office
just called to say that

279
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,180
a young man delivered your file

280
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,500
a minute ago.

281
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,420
Young man?

282
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,100
Yes, you will be accepted.

283
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,820
Oh, where is he?

284
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,780
He just left.

285
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,820
Okay.

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,300
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- You're welcome.

287
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,260
Lu Xiaolu!

288
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Lu Xiaolu!

289
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,580
Stop right there!

290
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,180
Why are you running?

291
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,340
I'm...

292
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,940
I'm just here to deliver your file,

293
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,860
not to see you.

294
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,660
I have to catch a train.

295
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,940
You rushed over here in such a hurry

296
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,060
and haven't eaten yet, right?

297
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,460
Let me treat you to a meal
before you go.

298
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,900
Picking vegetables, huh?

299
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,220
You are off work?

300
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,580
We are here.

301
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,860
Shh,

302
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,940
keep it down. The landlord
is very sensitive to noise.

303
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,940
Okay.

304
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
Come in.

305
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,380
You've been living in

306
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,420
such a small place
for the past two months.

307
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,220
Anyway, school is starting soon,

308
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,740
and I'll move to the dormitory.

309
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,060
Oh, I have a lot of things.

310
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,300
Can you help me move them?

311
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,220
Looks like
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

312
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,420
Tell me.

313
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,060
Lu Xiaolu,

314
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,100
do you really have a grudge
against my suitcase?

315
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,260
- Who's it?
- Get up, get up.

316
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,020
Ma'am,

317
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,060
I've told you many times,

318
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,620
you have to knock before entering.

319
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,780
What are you doing?

320
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,420
Why is there so much noise?

321
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,580
I was moving a suitcase.

322
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,740
You know,

323
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,060
my nephew is studying downstairs.

324
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,180
He can hear even

325
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,940
the slightest noise from upstairs.

326
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,940
He's just a primary school student.

327
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
I know.

328
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,740
Miss Bai,

330
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,700
we agreed before that

331
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,460
you'd live here alone

332
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,820
without any issues.

333
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,420
But

334
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,180
if it's two people living here,

335
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,980
I definitely wouldn't have agreed.

336
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,060
You young people

337
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,020
are too noisy

338
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,380
at night.

339
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,660
Young man,

340
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,780
come out.

341
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Stop hiding.

342
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,740
Ma'am,

343
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,180
this is my younger brother.

344
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,980
He's not feeling well.

345
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,740
He came to Shanghai
for medical treatment.

346
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,500
When is he leaving then?

347
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,380
He'll leave
after he finishes his treatment.

348
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,380
The sooner, the better.

349
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,820
Oh my...

350
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,900
It's really unlucky for me.

351
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,060
He can't stay here for long.

352
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,980
Okay.

353
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,380
It's the last box, right?

354
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,900
Thank you.

355
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,940
Bai Lan,

356
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,060
you've moved to the dormitory?

357
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,980
Is this your boyfriend?

358
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,940
Ah, no.

359
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,220
- No.
- Yes.

360
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,300
Well, you two go ahead.

361
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,420
I have a class to attend.

362
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,940
Is that the Oriental Pearl Tower?

363
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,020
It's really tall.

364
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,740
Yes,

365
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,500
too bad I don't

366
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,700
get a chance to take you around,

367
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,140
and show you some good places to eat.

368
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,260
These pan-fried buns are delicious.

369
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,260
Didn't you say before that

370
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,300
delicious food isn't necessarily
found in fancy restaurants,

371
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,980
but in those street corners?

372
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,420
Let me try your beef bun.

373
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,740
Want to try mine?

374
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,860
Young man,

375
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,180
can you help me take a picture?

376
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,020
Sure.

377
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,420
Three, two, one.

378
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,500
Thank you, thank you.

379
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,940
Do you want me
to take a picture of you two?

380
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,660
No need, we didn't bring a camera.

381
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,140
It's okay, I have one.

382
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,580
I'll take the picture and send it to you.

383
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,980
Let's take one together.

384
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,940
We won't know
when we'll meet again after you leave.

385
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,020
Right, right, make a memory.

386
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,260
Okay.

387
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,740
Get closer, closer.

388
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,780
Okay, look here.

389
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,940
Smile.

390
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,060
One, two, three.

391
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,580
Okay.

392
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,340
Give me your address.

393
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,140
Here's my address.

394
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,380
Okay,

395
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll make sure

396
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,420
to send you the photo,

397
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,100
but it might take a while.

398
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,540
But you're both young

399
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,940
- and you can wait.
- Thank you.

400
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,020
- Okay, thanks.
- Goodbye.

401
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,140
Once I receive the picture,

402
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,020
I'll send it to you.

403
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,180
Okay.

404
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,780
And you can write to me.

405
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
You have my address, right?

406
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,580
Yeah,

407
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,940
I know it.

408
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,140
Maybe

409
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,460
I should leave in a couple of days.

410
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,220
You're right.

411
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,820
It's rare for me to visit Shanghai,

412
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,140
but I haven't seen much yet.

413
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,140
I'll stay for a couple more days, okay?

414
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,580
Sure.

415
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,460
Hey, what's with this kid?

416
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,260
He's been in Shanghai for so many days.

417
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,460
Why hasn't he come back yet?

418
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,080
It's rare for him to go to a big city.

419
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,660
Let him have some fun
and broaden his horizons.

420
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,860
Isn't that good?

421
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,340
Are you heartless or what?

422
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,620
Come on, dear, have a bite.

423
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,300
Am I not letting him have fun?

424
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,540
I'm worried that

425
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,980
he won't come back.

426
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,820
Where else would he go if not back?

427
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,420
He'll definitely come back.

428
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,260
Don't worry.

429
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,980
Look at this one.

430
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,660
Phone call.

431
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,220
- Hello?
- Mom.

432
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,460
Lu Xiaolu,

433
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,020
you finally remembered to call home.

434
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,780
(Convenience Store)
Mom, calm down.

435
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,500
I want to discuss something with you.

436
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,980
Just say it.

437
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,460
I want to stay in Shanghai for a while.

438
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,340
I still want to go to college.

439
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,220
Lu Xiaolu,

440
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,900
you said

441
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,060
you wouldn't repeat a year

442
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,140
or go to college.

443
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,500
Now

444
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,380
you're saying you want to go to college?

445
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,100
Do you want me to spend my life
carrying sacks in the warehouse?

446
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,020
Even if I go back to the repair team,

447
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,220
what's the difference?

448
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,660
It is still a dead-end job.

449
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,500
I don't want to live like that again.

450
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,820
After all this talk,

451
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
it's still because of Bai Lan, right?

452
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,540
Yes,

453
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,700
it's for Bai Lan.

454
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,780
I came to Shanghai because of her.

455
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,460
But after arriving here,

456
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,020
I realized that Shanghai and Fucheng
are like two different worlds.

457
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,220
Looking at these skyscrapers,

458
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I feel full of motivation.

459
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,980
Mom,

460
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
I want to work hard

461
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,020
and strive for a better future.

462
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,900
Is that not okay?

463
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,340
Let me talk to him.

464
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,180
Mom,

465
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,260
why aren't you saying anything?

466
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,540
Xiaolu,

467
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,780
you really need to think this through.

468
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,860
What is that place?

469
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,580
That's Shanghai.

470
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,700
It's not easy to stand firm in Shanghai.

471
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
(Convenience Store, Public Telephone)

472
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,620
It takes a lot of hardship,

473
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,820
it's not easy at all.

474
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,980
Mom, I know it's not easy,

475
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,100
but I still want to give it a try.

476
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,300
I plan to

477
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,420
start looking for work today,

478
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,540
earning money to support myself

479
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,340
while preparing for next year's
college entrance exam.

480
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,700
Who knows,
if things go well in the future,

481
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,540
I might be able to bring
you and Dad here to enjoy life.

482
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,820
Don't worry about me and your dad.

483
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,700
But you have to think carefully

484
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,500
about your future plans.

485
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,140
Hello?

486
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Oh honey,

487
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,860
your health matters the most.

488
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,340
Eat more fruit to calm down.

489
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,180
Calm down.

490
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,820
Here you go.

491
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,620
Bai Lan,

492
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,500
there's a new student exchange meeting
in the auditorium tonight.

493
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,340
Are you going?

494
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm not going.

495
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,140
I have a friend coming to see me.

496
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,060
You mean boyfriend?

497
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,820
Come on.

498
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,140
Please come.

499
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,980
Next!

500
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,500
Your resume.

501
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,500
What?

502
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Your resume.

503
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
That.

504
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,820
Xiaolu.

505
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,380
Oh, right.

506
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,860
- Xiaolu.
- What position are you applying for?

507
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,060
What position?

508
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,260
Position.

509
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
The position you're applying for.

510
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,620
Maintenance Manager.

511
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,420
Maybe assistant?

512
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,300
Alright,

513
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,540
go back and wait for news.

514
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,380
Okay.

515
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,820
(Taihe Hotel)

516
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,820
I've worked as an electrician,

517
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,800
handling both high and low voltage,
installation, debugging,

518
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,980
and line maintenance, no problem.

519
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,840
(Housekeeping Department)
I just arrived in Shanghai,

520
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,060
so I'm not very familiar with the area,

521
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,140
but I can learn.

522
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,180
(Are you smiling today?)
Smell? What smell?

523
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,660
I have a smell?

524
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,100
But I took a shower.

525
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,820
Could you reconsider?

526
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,620
I really can learn.

527
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,500
Alright, don't move.

528
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,860
Not bad.

529
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,780
Let me see.

530
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,860
Look. It's beautiful.

531
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,700
It's all a blur.

532
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,620
Juan.

533
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,990
(Convenience Store, Public Telephone)
I've received the things you sent me,

534
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,660
such a big box.

535
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,100
They are some items you left in the dorm

536
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,420
and some snacks.

537
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,180
I know you like them.

538
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,980
They're all the things I love,

539
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,820
and I've been missing them for so long.

540
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,460
You've been gone for so long.

541
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,580
Don't you miss me?

542
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,780
I see.

543
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,540
It's because Xiaolu is with you,

544
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,100
and you have no time to miss me, right?

545
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,300
How is that possible?

546
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,580
Of course, I miss you too.

547
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,580
But speaking of which,

548
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,380
thanks to you both
for sending me the file,

549
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,620
otherwise, I would have
got expelled from school.

550
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,070
It's really thanks to that file

551
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,860
that you and Xiaolu could meet again.

552
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,300
Otherwise, the misunderstanding
wouldn't have been resolved.

553
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,300
Misunderstanding?

554
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,540
What misunderstanding?

555
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,700
You are back.

556
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
Come on, give it to me.

557
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,690
Alright.

558
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,140
Look,

559
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,860
I've fixed the curtains.

560
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,100
Little Pouter told me everything.

561
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,180
What did she say to you?

562
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,500
She said there's only one spot
for further education in the factory,

563
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,740
and you gave it to me.

564
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,260
Why didn't you
tell me about this earlier?

565
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,900
There was only one spot,

566
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,580
and I couldn't do anything about it.

567
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,380
So I had to...

568
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,940
From now on, no matter what happens,

569
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,980
you have to tell me, okay?

570
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,740
I want to be involved
in every step of your life.

571
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,660
Bai Lan.

572
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,740
I'm afraid...

573
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,440
I'm afraid I won't be able to do anything,

574
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,940
like last time.

575
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,460
It won't be like that,

576
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,980
because we're together again.

577
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,180
Yeah.

578
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,540
I can't finish all of this by myself.

579
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,140
So I need your help.

580
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,540
Master,

581
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,660
your meal is so plentiful.

582
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,220
There's a reason.

583
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,700
She's been like this

584
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,700
since Xiaolu left.

585
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,780
Eat.

586
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,420
Smoked duck.

587
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,800
Crispy outside, tender inside.

588
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,660
I learned this recently.

589
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,900
Xiaoying, Xiaoying,

590
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,020
that's enough.

591
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,780
Sit down and eat with us.

592
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,340
Yes, let's eat together.

593
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,700
Too salty.

594
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,060
It's not salty.

595
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,180
Not too salty at all.

596
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,900
It's just right.

597
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,140
Right, Master?

598
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,780
Oh, right. Not too salty.

599
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,860
Nonsense. It's definitely too salty.

600
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,380
Xiaolu loves sweet food the most.

601
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,820
He loves to eat lychee meat,

602
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,740
and would finish
the whole dish every time.

603
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,540
And southern fried liver.

604
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,660
It's so sweet,

605
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,540
ordinary people can't eat it every day.

606
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,300
But he just loves sweet food.

607
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,500
Xiaolu doesn't actually like sweet food.

608
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,380
- Actually, it's me...
- I can also cook spicy food.

609
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,300
But now that he's gone,

610
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,780
no one will eat the food
I make every day.

611
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,180
If he doesn't eat,

612
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,860
I will.

613
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,740
Slow down, slow down.

614
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,500
Stop writing, honey.

615
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,300
Xiaolu is already feeling it.

616
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,060
Keep writing, keep writing.

617
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,220
Come on, continue.

618
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,980
I have a suggestion.

619
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,900
Don't you like
watching "Shanghai Beach"?

620
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,100
I'll accompany you to watch it again.

621
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,220
Don't mention "Shanghai Beach" to me.

622
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,380
I'm so annoyed with Shanghai

623
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,460
and "Shanghai Beach" right now.

624
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,340
I won't mention it again.

625
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,100
What's wrong?

626
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,260
Is your stomach hurting again?

627
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,580
This has happened so many times.

628
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,460
Should we go to the hospital to check?

629
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,420
What's going on?

630
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,060
I'll massage your hand.

631
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,020
Go to the hospital?

632
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,380
The factory doesn't reimburse
medical expenses anymore.

633
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,500
Why waste money?

634
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,740
Honey,

635
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,900
don't let this rascal get to you.

636
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,220
With just one word from you,

637
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,660
I'll immediately take a train to Shanghai

638
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,020
and bring him back to apologize to you.

639
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,980
Bluffing.

640
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,860
You're just bluffing.

641
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Don't you know

642
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,580
what kind of temper your son has?

643
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,820
When he sets his mind on something,

644
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,940
who can change his mind?

645
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,460
Tell me,

646
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,380
what's the weather like in Shanghai now?

647
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,500
Shanghai

648
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,140
should be colder than Fucheng.

649
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,860
It's already the beginning of autumn.

650
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,300
I wonder if Xiaolu

651
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,540
brought enough clothes

652
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,500
and if he can handle

653
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,300
the food in Shanghai.

654
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,060
(Xiaolu, come home. Miss you.
Xiaolu, be safe and smooth.)

655
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,740
(Mom and Dad miss you in Fucheng.)

656
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
You said you have maintenance experience?

657
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,380
I worked in a factory
with over a thousand people.

658
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,900
I can repair circuits,
pipelines, water pumps,

659
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
and blowers—all of it.

660
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,930
Do you have an electrician's certificate?

661
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,000
An electrician's certificate?

662
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,500
Well, we do need an electrician here,

663
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,460
but without a certificate,
you can't start working.

664
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,860
Manager, I do know how to do it.

665
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,020
Why would I lie to you?

666
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,620
Our factory machines were

667
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,740
much more complex than yours here.

668
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,700
I can fix them all.

669
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,900
If you don't believe me,
give me a trial period,

670
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,740
how about that?

671
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,180
Nowadays, you need a certificate
for everything.

672
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,380
No certificate, no discussion.

673
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,460
You should leave now.

674
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,540
(Personal Resume: Lu Xiaolu,

675
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,500
Fellow-townsman?

676
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,820
Yes! Fellow-townsman!

677
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,580
How about this,

678
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,500
the intern's salary will be halved,

679
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,600
you can work here if you accept it.

680
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,900
Okay, no problem.

681
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,560

That's not good.

701
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,180
Let's endure a little longer.

702
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,820
When I save up enough money,

703
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,740
we'll move to a bigger house.

704
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,780
How about that?

705
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,860

(Work ID)

707
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,700
Tomorrow I can officially start working

708
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,620
as an electrician.

709
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,780
The manager said that if I do well,

710
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,020
I'll get promoted and a raise.

711
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,860
Really?

712
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,900
I also have good news.

713
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,300
Our teacher recommended me for a job

714
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,460
at a fashion company

715
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,780
with a salary.

716
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,180
A fashion company?

717
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,580
That sounds good.

718
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,940
It's just what you like.

719
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,860
But your main task is still studying.

720
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,060
Don't tire yourself out too much

721
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,020
for the sake of making money.

722
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,580
If we don't make money,
how can we move to a bigger house?

723
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,700
I'll support you.

724
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,100
Who would believe that?

725
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,260
Do we need

726
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,620
that cloth curtain?

727
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,380
Who knows if you'll do something

728
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,780
in the middle of the night?

729
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,460
Can a curtain stop me?

730
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,220
The landlord will hear you.

731
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,620
When I earn enough money,

732
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,420
I'll rent a bigger house

733
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,180
right outside your dormitory.

734
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,660
Then we won't have to be

735
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,940
so careful anymore.

736
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,900
Whenever you finish class,

737
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,140
I'll cook for you.

738
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,660
Do you like animals?

739
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,500
How about we raise a puppy?

740
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,260
I've already thought of a name for it.

741
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,540
Lucky.

742
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,820
We can also raise a parrot.

743
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,460
So every morning when we wake up,

744
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,500
we'll hear it say,

745
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,300
"Bai Lan, good morning,

746
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,620
Xiaolu, good morning."

747
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,940
It must be fun.

748
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,940
When it's mealtime,

749
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,460
you'll sit down at the table

750
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,940
and shout loudly,

751
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,620
"Xiaolu, I'm hungry!"

752
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,780
At that moment,

753
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
I'll bring the meals I've prepared

754
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,580
to the table.

755
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,300
You'll unabashedly devour the bones.

756
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,540
Oh no,

757
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,260
you'll handle the pork ribs,

758
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,100
and the puppy will handle the bones.

759
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,140
How beautiful.

760
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,700
After we finish eating,

761
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,220
if we have nothing else to do,

762
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,620
we'll watch TV.

763
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,300
While watching,

764
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,860
we'll both get sleepy.

765
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,620
At this point, I suddenly realize
you haven't brushed your teeth yet.

766
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,060
I'll remind you to brush them,

767
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,020
but you won't.

768
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,540
You insist that I carry you to bed.

769
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,300
I brush my teeth every day.

770
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,100
But

771
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,420
will this come true?

772
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,580
Yes.

773
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,260
So let's work hard together.

774
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
No problem.
