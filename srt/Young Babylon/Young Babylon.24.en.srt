Boss Hu,

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,790
I see the articulated truck has arrived.

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,450
Are we handling
some big business again soon?

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,650
Definitely.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,700
Once we finish this job,

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,330
I'll take you to Singapore,
Malaysia, and Thailand.

30
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,180
Great.

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,730
Where's Laowu?

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,540
He's cutting the watermelon.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,720
It's been a while.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,570
Laowu!

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,550
Boss Hu!

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Boss Hu!

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,610
Surprised to see you here,

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,980
Lu Dajiang.

39
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,010
You timed it perfectly to join us
for watermelon, didn't you?

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,220
I warn you.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't mess with my cousin again.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Hey, Lu Dajiang,

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,770
you're wrong here.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,330
Your cousin and I

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,790
have no grievances.

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm just getting paid to do a job.

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,770
Besides,

48
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,260
what has your cousin been up to?

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,420
Don't be impulsive. Listen to me.

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,400
Your cousin's been undermining
others' businesses,

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,700
and messing with others' women.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,630
If this were the underworld,

53
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,010
that would get him killed.

54
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,430
Dajiang,

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,190
you'd better go back

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,820
and advise your cousin to stop.

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,030
Don't be impulsive.

58
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,170
Let's talk this out calmly.

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,890
I'm a law-abiding citizen now.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,730
I don't want to get physical with you.

61
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,570
But my cousin is my red line.

62
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,170
If you dare touch him again,

63
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,940
even if it means I end up in jail forever

64
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,820
or pay with my life,

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,770
I won't let you off.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,290
I promise you.

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,610
- Boss Hu!
- I swear.

68
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,040
If I touch your cousin again,

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,850
may lightning

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,190
strike me down.

71
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,380
Alright?

72
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,040
What era does he think this is?

73
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,380
Still playing that with me.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,220
I'll find a way to settle this
once and for all.

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:56,460
=Episode 24=
=Never Thought of Parting=

76
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,890
After all this,

77
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,050
I didn't even get you to the hotel.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,540
Stay here for the night.

79
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,420
I've got everything prepared for you.

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,330
I know you're worried.

81
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,980
If you stay here,

82
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,980
Huang Qing might do something to me.

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,260
He didn't want the factory to restart,

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,890
so he had someone beat up Master Niu.

85
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,870
He didn't want us to collaborate,

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,940
so he had someone beat you.

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
I really don't know

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,620
what he might do next.

89
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,970
From the day I returned to Fucheng,

90
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,380
I've been losing.

91
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,040
What's more ridiculous

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,300
is how much I trusted him.

93
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,090
I thought he would help me.

94
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,890
I thought
I could revive the food factory.

95
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,330
Turns out

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,410
I was too naive.

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,210
I don't want you to get hurt.

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,970
Please try this. Have a taste.

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Sure.

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Does everyone have it?

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,430
Here, give it a try.

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,140
- I have one too?
- Sure.

103
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,260
Try it.

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,390
- What's this?
- I've never seen it before.

105
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,870
This drink was personally mixed
by Mr. Lu for you guys.

106
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,860
You can have a try.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Is it good?

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,530
Over the years,

109
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,310
our company's sales network

110
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,900
has been able
to spread throughout the province,

111
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,330
all thanks to our wholesale partners.

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,300
I sincerely thank everyone here.

113
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,270
Mr. Lu,

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,950
by calling us here today,

115
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,180
are you planning to distribute money?

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,760
You won't want

117
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,090
my little money.

118
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,980
Actually, today I invited everyone here

119
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,380
to ask for a favor.

120
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,700
What favor?

121
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,220
Looks like such a big deal.

122
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,660
As you know,

123
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
I was also

124
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,100
a part of the food factory.

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,340
Recently, an investment company
from Shanghai

126
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,030
became the major shareholder
of the food factory

127
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,360
and even plans to demolish the factory
for land redevelopment.

128
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,380
This not only means

129
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,180
the workers
wouldn't get the money they're owed,

130
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,820
but they would also be laid off.

131
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,260
These past few years,

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,300
such cases have been
too numerous to count,

133
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,460
all mired in disputes,

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,800
and nobody can do anything about it.

135
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,900
But we can't just watch the workers

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,460
struggle to make ends meet.

137
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,820
So,

138
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
my good friend from Shanghai,

139
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,100
the experienced investment manager
Bai Lan,

140
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,620
and I have decided

141
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,660
to develop a new product

142
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,620
for the food factory

143
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,100
for the workers to produce.

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,300
We'll handle the sales,

145
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,140
allowing them to earn their due wages

146
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,620
through their labor.

147
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,260
What's this new product?

148
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
The one you're holding now.

149
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,460
Try it again.

150
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,020
It tastes

151
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,780
a bit like the popular
Taiwanese milk tea recently,

152
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,780
but the flavor of jasmine

153
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,380
seems a bit stronger.

154
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,700
Our new product

155
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,860
is the "Golden Peacock Milk Tea".

156
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,940
This milk tea powder

157
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,740
was personally developed by Mr. Lu.

158
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,420
Besides having a unique flavor,

159
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,100
it's also easy to transport

160
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,180
and has a long shelf life,

161
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,700
suitable for sales nationwide.

162
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,740
Bai Lan and I will invest together

163
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,260
to retrofit the existing equipment.

164
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,660
The production might not be large,

165
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,460
but we're not aiming to make a profit,

166
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,580
just to ensure the workers

167
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,340
can live normally.

168
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,580
I must say

169
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,140
if the initial production volume is small,

170
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,620
distributors like us

171
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,060
might not see much profit.

172
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,620
If it doesn't sell well,

173
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,980
then we're all doomed.

174
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,820
That's right.

175
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,500
I understand.

176
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,660
If it loses money,

177
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,140
I, Lu Xiaolu,

178
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,300
owe everyone a debt.

179
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
I will repay it,

180
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,130
even if it means
selling everything I own.

181
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,820
But if it makes money,

182
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,500
aside from the workers' share,

183
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,340
I want nothing.

184
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,970
All profits will be distributed
among you all.

185
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,820
Mr. Lu,

186
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,300
that would be

187
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,860
too great a sacrifice for you.

188
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,180
If Mr. Lu's money isn't enough,

189
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,460
I can share the burden with him.

190
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,100
Anyway, our promises are written

191
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,020
in the contracts.

192
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,900
If we fail to fulfill them,

193
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,460
you can sue us.

194
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,700
We know Mr. Lu's character.

195
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,020
We still trust him.

196
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,620
I have no problem

197
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,540
with giving it a try.

198
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,380
I agree.

199
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,620
What about you all?

200
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
Sure.

201
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,660
Mr. Lu,

202
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,500
you really haven't left any way out
for yourself, have you?

203
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,140
It's so nice of you
to help the food factory like this.

204
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,060
I truly admire you

205
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,820
from the bottom of my heart.

206
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,900
So,

207
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,740
if there's anything you need,

208
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,420
just tell me.

209
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,260
Just tell us.

210
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,780
Sure.

211
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,420
Thank you, everyone.

212
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,860
Let's have a toast then.

213
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,420
- Let's do it.
- Come on. Cheers!

214
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,260
Come on.

215
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,380
Come on.

216
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,380
Take care on your way out.

217
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,460
Thank you. Thank you.

218

Take care.

219
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,420
- Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.

220
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,490
- Hey, sir.
- Take care, take care.

221
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,120
- Thanks for your support.
- You're too kind.

222
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,460
Just send me ten cases to start, okay?

223
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,740
No problem, no problem.

224
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,700
- Take care.
- Remember that.

225
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,940
- Take care.
- No problem.

226
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,460
Definitely. We've got you covered.

227
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,580
- All set, all set.
- Thanks, thanks.

228
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,740
Take it easy. Slow down.

229
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,780
Thanks!

230
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,700
- Keep in touch.
- Take care.

231
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,540
Thanks.

You're really decisive.

Did you hear?

what can we produce now?

we're going to use the factory workshop

you're nearly fifty, aren't you?

I don't want it to be your turn next.

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,300
Mr. Huang,

274
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,020
if you want to fire me,

275
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,180
there's nothing I can do.

276
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,020
But

277
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,300
if you want to drive away my brothers,

278
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,540
I can't do that.

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,220
My biggest worry right now

282
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,580
is this Huang Qing.

283
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,060
He's capable of anything,

284
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,030
and I'm afraid the workers
won't be able to withstand it.

285
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,220
The workers are the owners
of the factory.

286
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,340
Even if Huang Qing
wanted them to leave,

287
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,420
it wouldn't be easy.

288
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,300
So, this battle

289
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,580
is not yet decided.

290
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,860
You guys go ahead and talk.

291
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,380
I need to step out and make a few calls.

292
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,420
Happy now?

293
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,980

294
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,500
The Italians breached the contract,

295
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,820
and Bai Lan got fired.

296
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,060
You came just to tell me this?

297
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,780
Xiaolu,

298
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,860
I've said it before.

299
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,500
Let's go.

300
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,980
There's no need
to keep fighting for the factory.

301
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,900
Let's do our own business.

302
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,460
We have a bright future ahead.

303
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,580
I've said it before too.

304
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,380
Once I've decided something,

305
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,020
I won't give up easily.

306
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,020
I just don't understand.

307
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,220
Everything's gotten to this point,

308
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,900
and you still
can't see the situation clearly.

309
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,420
Their mess has nothing to do with you.

310
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,140
People are wicked,

311
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,340
and your kind heart

312
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,820
might not lead to a good outcome.

313
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,820
If you keep going, you'll end up hurt.

314
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,540
So what if I end up hurt?

315
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,260
Did you know me just now?

316
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,090
Lu Xiaolu, haven't you grown at all

317
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,900
over these years?

318
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
The moment you see Bai Lan,

319
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,540
you forget everything you've said,
don't you?

320
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,660
She's just using you.

321
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,980
Can't you see that?

322
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,580
I've reported the situation
of the food factory

323
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,180
to the city officials.

324
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
They've agreed in principle

325
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,740
to buy 100% of the food factory's shares

326
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,660
and then build a commercial plaza

327
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,620
on the site.

328
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,380
If everything goes smoothly,

329
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,060
we should be

330
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,900
putting out a tender soon.

331
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,580
Don't worry.

332
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,620
As for that,

333
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,740
I'll handle it.

334
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,780
I've prepared all the documents,

335
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,780
so let's sign the share transfer contract
as soon as possible,

336
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,900
to avoid any more complications.

337
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,020
Of course.

338
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,220
How are things on the worker's side?

339
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,100
Don't worry.

340
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,580
I have both soft

341
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
and hard measures prepared.

342
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,100
I've blocked every path
to save the factory.

343
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,980
They have no other choice now.

344
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,900
Good.

345
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,020
Then I'll be leaving now.

346
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,300
I look forward to hearing good news.

347
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,580
That person over there
has been following us for two days.

348
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,220
Who is he?

349
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,660
I've checked him out.

350
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,100
He's Lu Xiaolu's partner,

351
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,060
named Li Guangnan.

352
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,020
He seems troubled.

353
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,660
Maybe we should help him.

354
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,860
So you really resigned?

355
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Then all your years of effort

356
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,620
are wasted.

357
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,460
Let it be.

358
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,780
If it's the wrong path,

359
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,900
the further you go,
the harder it is to return.

360
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,300
Have you heard the story
of the little fish searching for the ocean?

361
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Once,

362
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,620
there was a little fish

363
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,420
aimlessly swimming in the water.

364
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,020
One day,

365
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,700
another fish told it

366
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,420
that far, far away,

367
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,620
there was an ocean

368
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,220
where the waters were much broader,

369
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,340
and it might
live a different life there.

370
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,180
So this little fish

371
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,100
began searching for the ocean,

372
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,820
swimming hard every day,

373
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,380
exhausted to the brink of death.

374
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,780
Until one day,

375
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,220
it couldn't swim anymore.

376
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,700
It followed a big fish
swimming in the river

377
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
and asked it,

378
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,980
"Do you know where the ocean is?"

379
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,700
The big fish said,

380
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,060
"This is the ocean."

381
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,860
I feel like over these years,

382
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,540
I've been like this little fish,

383
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,260
searching for the ocean.

384
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,620
I've worked tirelessly,

385
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,620
trying to become stronger,

386
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,020
because only then

387
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,180
will others not bully me.

388
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,740
But according to your story,

389
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,660
isn't the little fish getting closer

390
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,140
to its ocean?

391
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,180
Not really.

392
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
Because the path to success

393
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,980
has no end.

394
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,540
It was only during my return to Fucheng

395
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,220
that I realized

396
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,300
during my time in Shanghai,

397
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,460
I worked relentlessly,

398
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,420
always pushing forward,

399
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,820
but I had forgotten

400
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,580
what I was searching for.

401
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,540
You always make decisions so resolutely,

402
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,580
following your heart,

403
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,540
without even a fallback plan.

404
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,260
Should I call you brave

405
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,940
or crazy?

406
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,940
That's what life means.

407
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,100
Living freely,

408
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,900
and doing what you want.

409
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,460
Loving who you should.

410
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,380
I've truly come to terms with it.

411
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,620
You should be happy for me.

412
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
So, have you found the person you love?

413
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,380
I've seen how things have developed

414
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,020
between you and Xiaolu.

415
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,380
Why don't you try

416
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,740
following the call of your heart?

417
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,580
Following what call?

418
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,860
Right.

419
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,460
How are things with Li Guangnan?

420
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,780
Ever since he fell out with Xiaolu,

421
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,100
he's been like a lost soul,

422
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,380
wandering outside every day,

423
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,980
coming home late

424
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,260
with a smell of alcohol.

425
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,180
I really don't understand these two.

426
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,060
They've been brothers for so long.

427
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,420
Why can't they just talk it out?

428
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,300
They've been partners for many years.

429
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,940
Li Guangnan has given a lot.

430
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,140
If it were me,

431
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,380
I'd feel terrible too.

432
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,020
Speaking of giving,

433
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,820
Xiaolu has given the most.

434
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,260
You don't know

435
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,260
how hard he's had it these years.

436
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,020
Big Feet is working outside,

437
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,420
so he's been giving his salary

438
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,820
to Xiaoying,

439
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,860
even when he made no money.

440
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,940
Li Guangnan

441
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,340
is big-handed in his business,

442
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,620
always wanting to invest

443
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,140
with what he's earned for more profits.

444
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,940
He often lost more than what he gained.

445
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,020
In the end, it was always Xiaolu
who took care of his mess.

446
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,340
Sometimes,

447
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,220
I feel he's had it tough,

448
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,260
but he's like someone in a frenzy.

449
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Without Xiaolu,

450
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,500
none of us

451
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,980
would be where we are today.

452
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,580
But both of them are stubborn.

453
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,540
Neither is willing to back down.

454
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,540
Spend more time with Li Guangnan.

455
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,540
After I'm done with my busy days,

456
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,860
I'll invite him for a meal

457
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,700
to make amends.

458
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,500
Yeah.

459
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,500
He's so stubborn.

460
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,380
Left to his own,

461
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,820
he'd come up with nothing.

462
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,980
His birthday is coming.

463
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,740
Let's properly spoil him.

464
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,820
Mr. Huang, you asked me to meet you.

465
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,140
Isn't it because you were interested
in me first?

466
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,660
Looks like you know everything.

467
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,900
Catching mice is no fun.

468
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,300
I like to be straightforward.

469
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,500
Mr. Li,

470
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,300
have some coffee.

471
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,700
Since you like to be straightforward,

472
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
let's skip the pretense.

473
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,260
Tell me. What do you need?

474
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,420
Mr. Li, there's no need
to be hostile towards me.

475
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Although you're Lu Xiaolu's partner,

476
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,620
I'm Miss Bai's boss,

477
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,620
and we stand on different sides,

478
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,020
we don't necessarily have to be enemies.

479
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,740
What do you mean?

480
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,540
I'm well aware of your current troubles,

481
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,780
because I face the same troubles.

482
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,740
Why don't we collaborate

483
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,740
to set things back on track?

484
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,020
You mean

485
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,180
you want me to help you
stop their cooperation.

486
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,540
We both understand

487
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,620
their impulsive actions

488
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,140
will result in mutual destruction,

489
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,020
which neither of us

490
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,940
wants to see.

491
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,620
You underestimate them.

492
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,780
Together,

493
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,940
they're like one person.

494
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,460
I can't separate them,

495
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,020
neither can you.

496
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,180
It seems you really understand them.

497
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,780
Compared with my wife,

498
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,220
Lu Xiaolu might be the one
I know more about.

499
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,140
You wouldn't want

500
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,940
all of Xiaolu's efforts over the years

501
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,460
to go to waste, right?

502
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,380
Once this is done,

503
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,420
I'll leave Fucheng with Bai Lan,

504
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,340
but I know your business is expanding.

505
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,100
After it's settled,

506
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,140
I can help you
enter the East China market,

507
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
and even

508
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,700
invest in you.

509
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,980
Forget about investing.

510
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,620
It looks like
you invested in a food factory,

511
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,340
but you're really
just interested in the land.

512
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,180
Working with someone like you

513
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,500
would probably cost me sleep.

514
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,900
Mr. Li, that's a fresh perspective.

515
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,940
I like it.

516
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,300
Stop pretending.

517
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,740
The food factory has long been defunct.

518
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,340
It's worthless.

519
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,860
It's just that the land is still valuable.

520
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,580
You really think I don't know

521
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,440
that little scheme of yours
with Mayor Bi?

522
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,540
What are your demands?

523
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,860
Don't touch Xiaolu,

524
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,620
or the people at the food factory.

525
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,980
Come on.

526
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm just doing business.

527
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,900
It was your men

528
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,130
who hit my master and Lu Xiaolu, right?

529
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,140
You could never

530
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,500
let Xiaolu and Bai Lan
revive the factory.

531
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,660
Just say it outright.

532
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,060
What's your next step?

533
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,020
Are you planning
to remove Xiaolu as an obstacle

534
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,780
or to dismantle the food factory?

535
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,180
That depends on which one
you least want to see.

536
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,540
Give me some time.

537
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
I'll help you stop their cooperation.

538
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,660
Good.

539
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,740
I like working with smart people.

540
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,660
Now, Mr. Li,
will you drink the coffee I offered?

541
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,700
Sure.

542
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,620
But

543
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,580
after you acquire the land,

544
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,420
I want permanent leasing rights

545
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,740
to the piece
on the east side of the factory.

546
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,420
I didn't expect it to be so popular.

547
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,260
That land used to belong

548
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,540
to the hottest skating rink in Fucheng,

549
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,900
and it's something I owe someone.

550
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,540
It seems you value your promises.

551
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,140
But sorry,

552
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,220
that land has already been claimed
by someone else.

553
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,100
Then it depends

554
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,900
on whether you think I'm worth it or not.

555
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,740
Are you hungry?

556
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,900
Here, have some water.

557
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,180
You haven't come to see me these days,

558
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
nor answered my calls.

559
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
What have you been doing?

560
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,060
I've been a bit busy these days.

561
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,900
Dajiang,

562
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,220
would you consider

563
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,580
becoming the security manager

564
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,940
at the hotel?

565
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,780
Don't you want to work with me
every day?

566
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,620
I can see you every day
even as a street sweeper.

567
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,020
Being a sanitation worker is so free.

568
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,260
Unless you despise me now.

569
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,100
I...

570
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
I don't despise you.

571
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,380
How could I possibly despise you?

572
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,900
I just can't stop worrying about you.

573
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,820
Are you going to
keep hiding things from me?

574
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,260
I run a hotel.

575
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,540
All sorts of people come and go.

576
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,020
What news don't I hear?

577
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,700
That Huang Qing from Shanghai

578
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,860
is going against Xiaolu
with Boss Hu, right?

579
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,660
You're not the person you used to be.

580
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,900
Now, you're no match for Boss Hu.

581
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,660
Huang Qing and Mayor Bi

582
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,780
are his backing.

583
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,660
Xiaolu is no match for them.

584
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,820
But I can't just watch him be bullied.

585
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,220
You're too naive.

586
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,900
Boss Hu is just looking for a chance
to retaliate against you.

587
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,820
Don't deliver yourself to him.

588
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,060
Dajiang,

589
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,180
have you thought about leaving Fucheng

590
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,220
for a different life?

591
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,940
I have a few friends in Southeast Asia

592
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,700
who want me to expand my business there.

593
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm thinking of buying a hotel

594
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,500
in Pattaya, Thailand,

595
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,220
and then you can help me run it.

596
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,220
We could get away from Fucheng,

597
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,420
away from Boss Hu and our enemies.
How about that?

598
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,460
What about here?

599
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,780
I've talked to Xiaolu about it.

600
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,300
He fully supports you leaving with me.

601
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,900
Later, I'll gradually

602
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,980
liquidate the assets here.

603
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,780
Do we really have to go?

604
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,980
Yes.

605
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,300
Let's go to a place

606
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,420
where no one knows us,

607
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,620
away from all these grudges.

608
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,420
I believe you'll start to be happy.

609
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,500
Then do me a favor.

610
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,900
Huang Qing is so bold.

611
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,100
Surely, he's in league with Mayor Bi.

612
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,300
I need to know what they're really up to.

613
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,620
You're right.

614
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,780
Sticking with Xiaolu hasn't helped much.

615
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,460
I have to find their weakness.

616
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,660
That's the only way to truly help him.

617
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,700
After this is dealt with,

618
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,500
will you leave?

619
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,100
I've told you.

620
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,860
I won't leave you again.

621
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,340
Wherever you go,

622
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,580
I'll follow.

623
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,140
Mr. Li,

624
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,900
what are you and Mr. Lu up to?

625
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,380
Surely, you two

626
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,660
are not just joking with us, right?

627
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,620
How could that be?

628
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,700
There's something
you might not know yet.

629
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,060
I've split from Mr. Lu.

630
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,380
I stand here today

631
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,700
to represent Shanghai Huaxing Group.

632
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,780
Mr. Huang of Shanghai Huaxing

633
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,700
is about to buy the land
of the food factory

634
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,340
to build the largest

635
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,540
and most luxurious shopping plaza
in Fucheng.

636
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,220
Actually, I know

637
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,580
Mr. Lu asked for your help
with the food factory

638
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,260
to help the workers earn more money,

639
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,740
but this act

640
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,100
has seriously interfered
with the city's plans

641
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,100
for the food factory.

642
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,340
Your endeavor is doomed to fail,

643
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,500
and you won't gain any benefits.

644
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,260
What exactly are you trying to tell us?

645
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,820
It's simple.

646
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,300
Terminate your cooperation
with the food factory.

647
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,780
Of course,

648
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,620
we won't let you walk away empty-handed.

649
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,700
Mr. Huang has said

650
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,100
that if you agree
to terminate the cooperation,

651
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,420
when the shopping plaza opens,

652
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,820
if you want to rent a shop,

653
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,900
you'll receive a substantial discount.

654
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,340
And

655
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,780
Mr. Huang has prepared 200,000 yuan.

656
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,820
If you agree today

657
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,300
to terminate the cooperation,

658
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,540
you can take the money right away.

659
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,420
Mr. Li,

660
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,900
you're really

661
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,380
undermining Mr. Lu here.

662
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,020
No, no, no.

663
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,820
I'm saving him.

664
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,860
Even if you team up,

665
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,460
you're destined
to lose against Mr. Huang.

666
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,660
If you still remember

667
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,180
the good Mr. Lu once did for you,

668
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,660
then don't hurt him anymore.

669
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,740
Mr. Li,

670
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,220
we've already promised Mr. Lu,

671
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,620
remembering his kindness to us,

672
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,900
so we won't do anything dishonorable.

673
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,740
Don't speak so absolutely.

674
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,060
We're all businessmen here.

675
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,740
Who doesn't want to make money?

676
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Today, we're not making it hard for you.

677
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,500
If you agree,

678
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,940
this crisp 10,000 yuan

679
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
is yours to take immediately.

680
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,100
Mr. Li,

681
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,100
whatever personal grievances

682
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,380
you have with Mr. Lu

683
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,420
are none of our business,

684
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,940
but a man's promise

685
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,180
is worth its weight in gold.

686
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,100
We can't just back out

687
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,820
of our agreement with Mr. Lu.

688
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,220
- Yes, exactly.
- Right.

689
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,820
- Makes sense.
- So,

690
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
we definitely can't

691
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,420
take this money.

692
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,860
We can't accept it.

693
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,780
Mr. Li,

694
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,940
in this world,

695
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,900
the word "'honor''

696
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,540
must be engraved in our hearts.

697
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,700
Honor?

698
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,980
Are you all blind?

699
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,180
Turning down easy money?

700
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,620
Are you mad?

701
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,460
Mr. Li,

702
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,180
sorry,

703
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
but this is money

704
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,340
we can't afford to enjoy.

705
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,180
- Right. Let's go.
- Let's leave.

706
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,940
Don't just drink.

707
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,220
It's bad for your stomach.

708
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,180
If it hurts, it hurts.

709
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,060
I probably won't live
many more years anyway.

710
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,420
Stop saying that.

711
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,940
Nonsense.

712
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,180
You're not that old.

713
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,260
You still have to contribute to society.

714
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,140
Contribute?

715
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,380
The factory is nearly gone.

716
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,740
What contributions can I make?

717
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,860
China is so big.

718
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,100
You can contribute anywhere.

719
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,020
Why stick to this broken factory?

720
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
You don't understand.

721
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
When I was this tall,

722
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,340
I entered this factory.

723
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
I've touched every machine,

724
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,420
every pipe,

725
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,940
every valve,

726
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,580
every switch

727
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,540
in the factory.

728
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,580
For decades,

729
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,380
I've watched them

730
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,380
from shining bright

731
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
to rusty now.

732
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,980
They're broken

733
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,380
and leaking.

734
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,580
Whenever it's windy and rainy,

735
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,340
I seem to hear them calling to me,

736
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,820
"Master Niu,

737
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,500
come,

738
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,780
and have a drink."

739
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,580
Dad,

740
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,420
I need to talk to you.

741
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,140
Just talk.

742
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,820
Why are you taking my cup?

743
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,740
You know

744
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,860
that Xiaolu

745
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,620
merged his business with the factory,

746
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,300
and because of this, he and Li fell out.

747
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,300
Logically,

748
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,700
I support Li,

749
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,100
but emotionally,

750
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,860
I can't blame Xiaolu.

751
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,020
He's not wrong,

752
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,660
and he just did

753
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,220
what many people wish to do

754
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,660
but dare not.

755
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,260
But being caught in the middle,

756
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,140
I feel really down.

757
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,620
So, I talked it over with Big Feet,

758
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,740
and we've decided to leave Fucheng.

759
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,620
You can go wherever you want.

760
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,260
No one is stopping you.

761
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,780
I want you to leave with us.

762
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,900
How can I leave you here alone?

763
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,820
I was born in Fucheng,

764
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,620
grew up in Fucheng,

765
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,100
and I'll die in Fucheng.

766
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,500
Dad...

767
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,700
With the factory facing such difficulties,

768
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,220
you expect me to leave?

769
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,580
I can't do it.

770
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,980
- Dad.
- I...

771
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,260
It's about to rain.

772
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,900
I need to go check on the factory.

773
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,620
You've just had a drink.

774
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
It's okay.

775
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,540
I'm fine.

776
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,140
You old fool,

777
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,580
if I wasn't afraid of you
being bullied again,

778
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,220
do you think I'd want to leave Fucheng?

779
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,580
Something's wrong!

780
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,620
Hurry!

781
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,620
Master Niu,

782
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
someone's trying to smash
our golden peacock statue!

783
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,180
Smash it!

784
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,060
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

785
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,180
Get down from there!

786
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,180
Stop! Stop!

787
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,140
What are you doing?

788
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,100
Hurry down!

789
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,860
Who are you guys?

790
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
What unit are you from?

791
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,980
What does it matter to you
who I am, which unit I'm from?

792
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,700
- I...
- The factory's shut down.

793
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,940
Why do you need this thing anyway?

794
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,780
Smash it!

795
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,780
Stop! What are you doing?

796
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,380
What are you doing?

797
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Don't hit anyone!

798
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,100
Stop messing around!

799
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,980
We have orders from our leaders.

800
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,140
The whole factory has to be demolished.

801
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,220
It's no use resisting.

802
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,460
Which leader said that?

803
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,740
Name them.

804
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,020
Which leader?

805
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,260
- Try smashing it!
- Stop!

806
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,740
I'm telling you.

807
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,980
If you dare smash it again,

808
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,940
today you won't leave

809
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,820
without severe injuries.

810
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,460
- Right!
- Watch your stick!

811
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,780
I'm telling you the truth.

812
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,180
The Golden Peacock Food Factory,

813
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,620
this broken factory,

814
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,620
is going to be demolished
to build a shopping plaza.

815
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,460
Plaza?

816
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,980
If it's not today,

817
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,740
it'll be demolished tomorrow.

818
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,030
You can continue this commotion.

819
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,500
There's a reason

820
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,700
behind your failure.

821
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
Let's go.

822
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,940
- Get out!
- Get out!

823
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,980
- Don't be afraid!
- Get out of here!

824
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,260
They came to deliver a message.

825
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,500
We weren't raised to be scared.

826
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,940
Mr. Ma,

827
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,620
we probably need to keep someone
at the workshop overnight.

828
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,580
- Right.
- Otherwise,

829
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,620
these kids will cause trouble.

830
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,680
There's nothing else we can do.

831
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,460
- Okay, I'll go notify everyone now.
- Sure.

832
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,260
You guys keep an eye on the main gate.

833
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,100
Alright.

834
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,940
You two go up and check.

835
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,220
If anything's loose,

836
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,260
secure it.

837
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,980
Otherwise, it could fall
and hurt someone.

838
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,540
- Alright, Master.
- Go and check.
