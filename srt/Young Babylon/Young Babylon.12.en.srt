used to be different.

77

please don't be mad.

78
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,420
I brought you some fruit.

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,260
Mom.

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,700

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,770
Okay, okay.

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,740
You've locked yourself
in the room all night.

83
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,650
Dad and I are worried sick about you.

84
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,170

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,330

Mom!

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,780
Running away from home?

88
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,700
You didn't discuss it with us

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,250
before you decided to go to Shanghai!

90
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,890
I'm discussing it with you two right now.

91
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,130
Is this discussing?

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,490
It's notifying.

93
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,130
Okay, alright.

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,570
Since you were born until now,

95
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,940
I've never

96
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,490
seen your mom so angry.

97
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,090
If we count from when we met,

98
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,450
it's only happened once.

99
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,890
Which time?

100
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Back then,

101
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,020
we hadn't come out

102
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,180
in the open.

103
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,370
Our families didn't know about us.

104
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,740
Your grandmother insisted on
arranging blind dates for me,

105
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,610
so I went along.

106
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,780
Then Comrade Zhao Lizhen found out.

107
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,060
My goodness,

108
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,890
she didn't talk to me
for over two months.

109
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,450
That long?

110
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,410
So,

111
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,660
how did you win my mom back?

112
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,610
Later,

113
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,340
after continuous efforts

114
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,140
and writing hundreds of love letters,

115
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,850
things improved.

116
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,540
So many years have passed,
and just thinking about that incident

117
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,210
still makes my back sweat.

118
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,490
Good for you, Dad.

119
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,370
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,780
Dad, can you also help me

121
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,130
figure out a way?

122
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,770
Help you figure out a way?

123
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,890
It looks like

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,530
only I can deal with

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,210
Comrade Zhao Lizhen.

126
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,250
Lu Xiaolu

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,530
is really out of line.

128
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,500
In his eyes,

129
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,290
do parents even exist anymore?

130
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,540
I'd say it's because

131
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,250
I haven't spanked him enough.

132
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,530
What are you saying?

133
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,460
What did you say?

134
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
No, I...

135
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,300
Is our son

136
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,290
- for you to scold?
- What are you doing?

137
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,170
I can scold him

138
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,130
but you can't.

139
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,650
Talking about that child,

140
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,690
back then,

141
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,540
I got such a long cut

142
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,620
on my stomach

143
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,050
just to give birth to him.

144
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
And it was not easy

145
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,010
to raise him.

146
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,570
But he's turned out
to be this heartless thing.

147
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,330
Look at what he's doing now.

148
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,290
He forgot his mother right after
he's got a girlfriend.

149
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,530
It's all because of you.

150
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,890
He learned this from you.

151
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,380
How could that be true?

152
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,650
How could it not be true?

153
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,780
He inherited

154
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,660
this trait

155
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,650
from you.

156
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,420
He's not like me.

157
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,130
I'm devoted to you.

158
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,770
Come on.

159
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,890
What should we do?

160
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,860
What should we do?

161
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,730
You need to help me figure out a way.

162
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,620
We can't let our son

163
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,290
end up like you back then,

164
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,420
being taken away by his wife easily.

165
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,890
Lu Xiaolu, are you out of your mind?

166
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,340
You're studying now,

167
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,960
preparing for
the adult college entrance exam

168
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,340
to go to Shanghai?

169
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,970
What's wrong with that?

170
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,580
If it hadn't been for Bai Lan,

171
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,650
I should be in a university classroom
right now.

172
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,300
And she's helping me
with exam retakes now.

173
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,210
Isn't that great?

174
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,580
It's not that I look down on you,

175
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,540
but with your grades,

176
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,690
I'll believe it if you say
you can pass the adult college exam,

177
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,420
but you are saying
you can go to a college in Shanghai?

178
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,460
That's like Big Feet telling me

179
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,500
he's going to hold a concert
in Hung Hom, Hong Kong.

180
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,610
Just pure nonsense.

181
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,100
Who's that?

182
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,220
Let's go.

183
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,690
Big Feet?

184
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
What are you doing in there?

185
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,020
What are you hiding? Let me see.

186
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,180
It's nothing. I'm not hiding anything.

187
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,660
What is it? A carnal book?

188
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,500
No.

189
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,250
Why are you reading?

190
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,460
I...

191
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,620
Xiaolu.

192
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,370
Have you seen Big Feet?

193
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,420
Big... Big Feet?

194
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,580
We've been looking for Big Feet too.

195
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,930
No.

196
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,010
We haven't seen him for days.

197
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,700
There's so much work in the maintenance.

198
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,370
Dozens of water pumps and light bulbs
need to be fixed.

199
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,300
He's probably off somewhere
avoiding work.

200
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,500
- I think so too.
- If we find him,

201
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,770
we'll send him back right away.

202
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,780
Okay, let's look elsewhere.

203
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,980
Let's go.

204
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,210
Come on.

205
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,420
Have they left?

206
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,540
Yes.

207
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,100
(Chemistry)
A high school chemistry book?

208
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,810
Could it be...

209
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,690
Yeah, I also want to be in college.

210
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,970
I was thinking,

211
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,490
since the factory isn't doing well,

212
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,490
I thought I could do something else.

213
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,970
But please don't tell anyone.

214
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,930
They say that workers participating
in the adult college entrance exam

215
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,460
are considered shirking work,

216
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,340
reaching too far,

217
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,330
being ambivalent,

218
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,300
and changing loyalty...

219
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,340
Is that a word?

220
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,450
Yeah, changing loyalty.

221
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,210
You know what?

222
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,450
If I get caught,

223
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,060
I will not only be fined.

224
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,410
I'll also be shifted to the graveyard shift.

225
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,060
That's what you should keep in mind.

226
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,240
The graveyard shift is really scary.

227
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,860
Stop studying.

228
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,130
Big Feet, I support you.

229
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,300
Let's take the exam together.

230
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,540
Really?

231
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,650
The more some people look down on us,

232
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,490
the more we have to prove them wrong.

233
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,060
Great! Great!

234
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,020
Thank you, Xiaolu!

235
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,860
Debao!

236
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,660
Debao! I found Big Feet!

237
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,930
Lower your voice.

238
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,260
Debao!

239
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,650
Quiet!

240
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,130
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

241
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,010
You can eat a bit more.

242
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,540
You're too thin.

243
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,050
That's enough.

244
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,980
That's enough, thank you.

245
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,820
Here.

246
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,610
I'm not sure

247
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,100
what's

248
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,780
been going on lately.

249
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,410
I feel uncomfortable all over.

250
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,690
I have headaches at night

251
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,170
and back pain
while working during the day.

252
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,250
My liver

253
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,730
hurts

254
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,810
a lot.

255
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,460
You're a doctor.

256
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,890
Can you help me with it?

257
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Mrs. Lu,

258
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,690
I'm no longer the factory doctor.

259
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,380
If you're feeling unwell,

260
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,610
go see Dr. Tian or go to the hospital.

261
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,540
Also, this area is your stomach,

262
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,380
not your liver.

263
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,010
Oh, really?

264
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,290
I'm getting older,

265
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,540
and I've

266
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,930
worked hard to raise my son.

267
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,090
It's okay if he won't be wealthy,

268
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,700
but now that

269
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,420
he's in love,

270
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,500
he wants to leave my side.

271
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,660
What's going on?

272
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,060
I understand now.

273
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,500
You invited me to dinner

274
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,820
because of Xiaolu
going to Shanghai, right?

275
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,380
Xiaolu is lucky to have you

276
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,140
as his girlfriend.

277
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,020
He's been mischievous
since he was little,

278
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,660
but he's never

279
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,820
gone against us

280
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,740
on important matters.

281
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,540
Yet, since meeting you,

282
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,340
he seems like a different person.

283
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,180
Have you ever considered that

284
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,940
this might be the real Lu Xiaolu?

285
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,540
He has his ideals,

286
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,660
pursuits, and rebellion.

287
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,940
Do you think

288
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,700
you really know him?

289
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,220
Alright,

290
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,860
then let me ask you.

291
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,220
Do you share common interests?

292
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,260
Similar life experiences?

293
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,060
Unified life goals?

294
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,860
You like each other now,

295
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,020
you feel excited together,

296
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,060
but can you guarantee that will last?

297
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
You've already decided

298
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,460
to explore the world in another city,

299
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,620
but have you thought about taking
responsibility for each other's future?

300
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,140
Mrs. Lu,

301
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,100
I only know that

302
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,420
Xiaolu really likes me,

303
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,100
and I like him too.

304
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,460
So, since we've decided

305
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,300
to pursue the life we want together,

306
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,420
we won't be easily shaken.

307
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,700
You're too young.

308
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,900
You think you can
sacrifice everything for love.

309
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,180
It's brave and romantic,

310
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,140
but in the future, you'll realize

311
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,740
how naive and crazy

312
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,260
your decisions are now.

313
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,820
But if you don't have a naive

314
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,460
and crazy moment when you're young,

315
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,260
you'll regret it later.

316
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,420
This house is the new home of my son

317
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,620
and daughter-in-law.

318
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,980
Right after they got married,

319
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,740
they went to Guangzhou to do business.

320
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,420
Look, the furniture is all new.

321
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,300
Good view

322
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,460
and location.

323
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
- Here.
- Thank you.

324
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,500
You two can take a closer look.

325
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,260
Okay. Thank you.

326
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
Thanks.

327
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,700
The buildings in Fucheng
are getting taller and taller.

328
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,740
Li Guangnan, come and have a look.

329
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,780
Li Guangnan,

330
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,460
didn't you say you'd come
to see the new house with me?

331
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,660
Why the sour face?

332
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,820
Come on, tell me why.

333
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,540
You said Fucheng is getting better.

334
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,020
Why does Lu Xiaolu want to leave?

335
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,940
No matter how good Fucheng is,

336
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,500
if Bai Lan doesn't like it, it's useless.

337
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,420
But he has family and friends here.

338
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,500
He has nothing in Shanghai,

339
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,660
what if he gets bullied?

340
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,940
Lu Xiaolu will never be bullied.

341
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,300
Every time you get bullied,

342
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,500
he's always the one standing up for you.

343
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,460
You're right.

344
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Lu Xiaolu

345
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
would never leave his friends behind.

346
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,300
You've waited a long time?

347
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,660
What do you think?

348
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,900
My cousin left it to me.

349
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,220
Cool, right?

350
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,460
Yeah.

351
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,940
This will be
your exclusive seat from now on.

352
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,620
I get out of class
an hour earlier than you,

353
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,940
so I used that hour

354
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,460
to get familiar with the surroundings.

355
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,420
I checked out all the bookstores,

356
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,940
stationery shops, and restaurants.

357
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,500
This is the reference book you need.

358
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
You are quite efficient.

359
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,780
What are you going to do later?

360
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,580
I'm going home to review, of course.

361
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,940
Let me tell you,

362
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,900
I'm full of energy

363
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,380
from head to toe.

364
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm even scaring myself.

365
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,900
Then I'll go with my classmates
to continue studying.

366
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,140
Alright, go ahead.
I'll come pick you up later.

367
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,980
Okay.

368
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,100
That's cool!

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,140
Bad news! Bad news!

370
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,980
What's wrong?

371
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,540
Li Guangnan is in trouble!

372
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,740
Hurry! Come on!

373
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,700
Hurry.

374
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,660
What took you guys so long?

375
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,500
Li Guangnan would be in deep trouble
if you'd be any later.

376
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,340
What's the situation?

377
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,500
The leader is called Boss Hu.

378
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,740
They are carrying knives

379
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,780
and seem reckless.

380
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,100
Boss Hu?

381
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,220
Here.

382
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,660
Let's go meet them.

383
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,500
Hey, wait a minute.

384
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,330
What are you hesitating for?

385
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,140
I mean,

386
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,380
I don't even

387
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,300
have a girlfriend yet.

388
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,780
If I go in,

389
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,260
I might lose my life.

390
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,820
Think about it, I just started classes...

391
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,980
Enough talking.

392
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,060
I have an idea.

393
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,660
I'll go in first

394
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
and meet them.

395
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,820
Boss, take a break.

396
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,940
Look at this magazine.

397
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,180
It's amazing!

398
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,060
What magazine?

399
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,260
Do you even know how to read?

400
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,580
It's mostly pictures.

401
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,820
This is good indeed.

402
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,020
- Where did you get this from?
- Boss Hu.

403
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Long time no see.

404
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,260
Lu Dajiang's cousin.

405
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,300
Long time no see.

406
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,940
Why did you kidnap my friend?

407
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,780
Your cousin is in prison.

408
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,900
The skating rink

409
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,620
will be mine sooner or later.

410
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,860
I know

411
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,620
you've been eyeing that spot
for a long time.

412
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
But what does that have to do
with Li Guangnan?

413
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, dodge! Dodge!

414
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,100
He didn't

415
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,820
recognize the situation

416
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,460
and came into my shop,

417
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,980
accusing me of taking over
your cousin's territory.

418
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,900
He not only broke my things,

419
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,140
but also attacked my people.

420
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,100
So what if I hit you?

421
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,340
How much money do you want?

422
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,780
I'll pay.

423
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,980
At least this much.

424
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,700
Okay, 500 it is.

425
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,860
But you must release him today.

426
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,380
This is not just about money.

427
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
I have another condition.

428
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,660
What is it?

429
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
Guess.

430
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,660
Tell me.

431
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,020
Over the years,

432
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,940
Lu Dajiang has been giving me hard times.

433
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,860
I've suffered a lot in Fucheng.

434
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,380
Today, if you kneel down, admit defeat,

435
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,700
and crawl under my crotch,

436
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,580
I'll let him go.

437
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,420
Kneel down!

438
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,140
- Kneel!
- Kneel!

439
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,300
Take him away.

440
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,540
Big Feet, drink it up!

441
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,540
No, no, no.

442
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,500
This is too strong.

443
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,860
But today, when you rode
that small cart in to save me,

444
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,100
that was really cool.

445
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,740
- Thank you.
- If you can make that move

446
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,540
and then spin out,

447
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,700
that would be even cooler.

448
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,300
You're right!
I'll practice that move later.

449
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,340
Sure, sure, sure.

450
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,700
How did you make the smoke bombs?

451
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,100
Boss Hu was coughing like hell!

452
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,940
Oh, help! Help!

453
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,420
It's quite simple.

454
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,460
Just mix syrup with a few firecrackers,

455
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,260
and add chili powder

456
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,100
for that extra kick.

457
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,660
- Chili powder?
- No wonder!

458
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,540
Essence! Essence!

459
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
No wonder! No wonder!

460
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,420
Xiaolu,

461
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,580
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,460
I acted impulsively.

463
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,140
Anyway,

464
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,620
thank you all

465
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,740
for saving my life today.

466
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,580
I will drink it up.

467
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,420
Thank you again.

468
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,620
It's not much,

469
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,700
but can help a bit.

470
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,260
What do you mean?

471
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,660
This happened
because you defended my cousin.

472
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,380
The feud between Boss Hu and him

473
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,900
has been going on for a long time.

474
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,260
He's clearly
just using this as an excuse.

475
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,420
It's not your fault.

476
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,580
In the future, don't face

477
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,340
these things alone.

478
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,260
No need to do that.

479
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Actually,

480
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,980
I've thought about a lot of things

481
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,820
during this time I was kidnapped.

482
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,740
Look,

483
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,100
the milk tea formula is still with us.

484
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,860
We can still make money.

485
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,860
You and I

486
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,900
can handle packaging design and sales,

487
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,660
Big Feet can promote the product,

488
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,140
- Xiaoying can manage the...
- The raw materials.

489
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,460
Yes, raw materials.

490
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,980
And Little Pouter
can handle the finances.

491
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,860
If we're short-handed,

492
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,020
we can call Pig Teeth

493
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,220
- and Dumb Jar to help.
- Right!

494
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,900
As the business grows,

495
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,440
we'll make enough money
to repay the debts.

496
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,060
It's a good idea,

497
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,020
but I've said it before.

498
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,380
I need to study.

499
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,780
I want to go to Shanghai.

500
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,100
I actually want to study too, but...

501
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,660
Think before you talk.

502
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,260
No, I don't want to study.

503
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,020
You just told me

504
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,260
not to face things alone.

505
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,060
Why are you leaving when we're about

506
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,340
to do something worthwhile?

507
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,540
You're the backbone of our group.

508
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,900
If you leave, what will we do
if they come looking for trouble again?

509
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,140
Yeah.

510
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,980
If you really want to leave,

511
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,460
let's expand the business first,

512
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,660
and then you can leave with money.

513
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,500
Exactly!

514
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,860
How can you just leave now

515
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,140
and leave us behind?

516
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,180
Yes.

517
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,940
I think Xiaoying is right.

518
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,900
I agree with her.

519
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,380
I owe them a lot of money.

520
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,860
If I don't repay it, they'll kill me.

521
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,820
Xiaolu, I'm begging you.

522
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,500
Stop crying. Alright, alright.

523
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,780
Okay.

524
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Okay.

525
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,380
I'll help.

526
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,940
But remember,

527
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
just this one time.

528
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,300
Just one time.

529
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,500
Fill your cups.

530
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,300
Cheers!

531
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,060
Xiaolu is really a great friend.

532
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,900
(A cup of milk tea is all you need.
Fresh milk brings you sweetness)

533
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,260
Let me taste.

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,100
Here.

535
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,100
Here, Guangnan.

536
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,020
Thank you, thank you.

Oh, I thought you would never come back.

639
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,660
let me explain.

640
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,260
I admit I've been skipping classes lately,

641
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,820
but there are reasons for it.

642
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,100
Are there really reasons,

643
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,820
or do you simply not want to study?

644
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,940
Do you not believe me?

645
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm studying while working,

646
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,220
eating,

647
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,700
and even sleeping,

648
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,820
all to be able to go to Shanghai with you.

649
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,660
But I also have friends in my world.

650
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,490
I can't ignore Li Guangnan's situation.

651
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,620
I hope you can understand.

652
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,620
I know you have a lot of people
in your world,

653
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
but how do you know
I can't understand you?

654
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,740
I believe in you so much,

655
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,580
but what did you do?

656
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,580
Say something, will you?

657
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,660
What's going on?

658
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,420

659
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,820
He must be
having a fight with his girlfriend.

660
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,740
Having a fight?

661
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,140
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

662
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,940
How is that possible?

663
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,140
Am I enjoying this?

664
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,020
They are still young,

665
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,500
having a fight is pretty normal.

666
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,180
Remember when

667
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,980
we were dating? Did we ever argue?

668
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,140
- No.
- Exactly.

669
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,140
I always let you have your way.

670
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,220
That's because you are always right.

671
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,860
Exactly,

672
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,420
I have always been right.

673
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,180
When two people are right for each other,
everything is harmonious.

674
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,460
- Isn't that true?
- Absolutely.

675
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,220
If two people aren't harmonious,

676
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,340
how can there be

677
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,140
eternity,

678
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,460
growing old together,

679
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,180
or everlasting love?

680
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,260
Isn't that right?

681
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,540
Absolutely, all correct.

682
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,140
So, if they are not harmonious,

683
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,260
their relationship can't last long.

684
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,100
What's wrong?

685
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,540
I don't know what is going on
with my stomach.

686
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,020
It has been hurting.

687
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,340
It's been acting up again?

688
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,370
That's why you shouldn't say such things.

689
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,220
What things?

690
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,700
And never fake a problem

691
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,420
to scare Bai Lan.

692
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,060

694
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,140
is getting on my nerves.

697
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,820
give me my salary bag.

Li Guangnan owes you.

703
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,030
I'll pay you the remaining back
as soon as possible.

704
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,300
When I'm away,

705
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,180
don't bother my brothers anymore.

706
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,460
Hey, wait.

707
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,460
Mr. Lu

708
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,980
has no merits

709

720
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,820
Firstly,

721
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,140
on behalf of our company,
I'd like to thank you...

722
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,980
I mean,

723
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,980
all of you.

724
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,820
Thank you all

725
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,780
for supporting our

726
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,420

727
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,220
The rest depends on you.

728
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,500
Laowu. Explain to Mr. Lu.

729
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,420
- Okay.
- Tell him what's going on exactly.

730
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,860
Mr. Lu,

731
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
it's Li Guangnan.

732
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,220
He said as long as
we cooperate in staging a play,

733
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,380
he'll cover our annual beverage expenses.

734
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,300
- How many more do we need?
- Li Guangnan!

735
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,700
Xiaolu, Xiaolu!

736
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,260
- Xiaolu, what are you doing?
- Tell me!

737
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,300
What are you doing? Let go!

738
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,140
What are you doing?

739
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,220
It might be a misunderstanding!

740
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,030
You know perfectly
that it's not a misunderstanding!

741
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,500
Tell me.

742
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,620
Why did you lie to me?

743
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,060
So what if I lied to you?

744
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,660
Will you stay if I don't lie to you?

745
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,400
You'll just leave
only because you want to.

746
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Have you considered us

747
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,220
or the milk tea shop?

748
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,220
Move aside.

749
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,620
It's my own choice

750
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,020
to leave, to stay, to go anywhere!

751
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,940
Lu Xiaolu,

752
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,980
that's what you are truly thinking, right?

753
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,060
What am I to you, really?

754
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,900
What are you doing?

755
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,030
We missed the college entrance exam
together,

756
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,180
fought together,

757
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,420
faced discipline together.

758
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,260
Why didn't you say that then?

759
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,380
Now, because of Bai Lan,

760
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,100
you want to cut ties with me?

761
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,340
As you wish.

762
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,220
- Xiaolu.
- Xiaolu!

763
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,300
Didn't you say we were a team?

764
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,700
What's the problem?

765
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,300
What's the matter?

766
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,660
I

767
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,620
came to pick you up.

768
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,100
No need,

769
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
I have something to do later.

770
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,580
Hi, Bai Lan.

771
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,940
So this is your boyfriend?

772
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,780
Yes.

773
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,820
Hey, how are you?

774
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,660
I'm treating everyone
to Western food later.

775
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,820
Do you want to join us?

776
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,380
Do you?

777
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,260
Sure!

778
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,890
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

779
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,060
Bai Lan, how do you usually study?

780
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,580
I'm so worried about

781
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,940
the English test coming up.

782
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,100
It's actually not that hard.

783
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,580
Just review a few more times.

784
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,060
I'll lend you my notes tomorrow.

785
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,700
Really? That's great!

786
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,700
Hey, this song sounds familiar. It's...

787
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,180
It's from a famous western rock band.

788
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,620
Yes. You also like
listening to western rock?

789
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,420
My dad used to travel abroad frequently

790
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,700
and always brought back

791
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,260
lots of cassette tapes

792
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,420
and CDs

793
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,060
that we couldn't hear.

794
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,020
If you like them,

795
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,260
I can lend them to you.

796
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,100
Then I'll exchange books with you.

797
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,420
I have works by Wang Shuo, Mo Yan,

798
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,260
Wang Xiaobo, everything.

799
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,660
Do you have any books by Su Tong?

800
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,220
I love reading his books.

801
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Of course I do.

802
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,340
Then I'll benefit from it.

803
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,500
Are you hungry? Let's order.

804
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

805
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,510
Waitress!

806
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,220
Hello, sir.

807
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,580
May I take your order?

808
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,020
You go ahead.

809
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,820
Their salami is highly recommended.

810
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,580
But I heard that German-style salami

811
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,180
has a high fat content.

812
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,020
Didn't Su Tong say that

813
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,860
for a piece of meat,
no matter how it's cooked,

814
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,420
the fat is its soul?

815
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,300
Alright, I'll trust you.

816
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,620
One German-style salami

817
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,700
and one filet mignon,

818
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,020
medium rare. Thank you.

819
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,980
I'll have a medium-rare sirloin.

820
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,100
I'll have a sirloin too,

821
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,940
medium well.

822
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,460
Xiaolu, what about you?

823
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,100
This one.

824
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Okay. How would you like it?

825
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,380
Eighty percent well.

826
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,140
Then I'll have the same,

827
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,100
eighty percent well.

828
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
A customer just now

829
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,620
(Restroom)
ordered an eighty percent well filet.

830
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,260
Do you think he's doing that on purpose?

831
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,300
Who eats an eighty percent well steak?

832
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,980
He must be a country bumpkin.

833
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,500
Let's just make it however.

834
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,380
Right.

835
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,260
He probably won't even tell.

836
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,740
Exactly.

837
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,300
Let's go.

838
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
Bai Lan,

839
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,820
how did you meet Xiaolu?

840
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,140
Were you college classmates?

841
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,260
He's my colleague from the food factory.

842
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,020
A colleague?

843
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,220
Which university did he graduate from?

844
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,540
He's preparing to take the entrance exam.

845
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,860
Bai Lan, the guy you like

846
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,580
is different from what I imagined.

847
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,660
Yeah?

848
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,260
What kind of guy
do you think I should like?

849
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,580
I think an excellent girl like you

850
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,500
would like someone
knowledgeable, cultured,

851
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,140
with shared interests.

852
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,140
At the very least, he should be
a university graduate.

853
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,740
He'll be one soon.

854
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,380
Hey, I suddenly remembered,

855
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,620
I have to do a night shift
at the warehouse.

856
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,540
I need to go back.

857
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,620
For us working-class folks,

858
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,220
time is really not our own.

859
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,900
Oh, when the steak is served,

860
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
you should go ahead and split it.
It's quite expensive.

861
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,980
Don't waste it.

862
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,420
I'll head off. Enjoy it!

863
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,980
Goodbye.

864
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,380
I'll leave too.

865
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,380
Hey...

866
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,980
Let's go for fish ball soup.

867
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:02,820
(Fish Ball)

868
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,820
You actually chose fish balls

869
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,460
over steak?

870
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,180
You said you would take me to this place.

871
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,460
So, how was it? Is it good?

872
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,380
To be honest,

873
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,500
when I first came to Fucheng,
I couldn't get used to the food here.

874
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,940
I found everything

875
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,500
too sweet and light,

876
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,180
not suitable for a northerner like me.

877
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,580
Even now, I haven't fully adapted.

878
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
So,

879
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,500
forcibly changing someone's stomach
is difficult.

880
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,220
Just like this bowl of fish ball soup,

881
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,060
people who like it

882
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,980
may not necessarily like steak.

883
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,980
What do you mean by that?

884
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
These days,

885
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,860
I've been thinking about what you said.

886
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,860
I think you're right.

887
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,740
This is your home,

888
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,100
with your family and friends.

889
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,500
If I were to forcibly take you away,

890
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,820
wouldn't that be selfish?

891
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,980
Don't say that.

892
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,180
How do you know

893
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,700
I am not leaving willingly?

894
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,220
I came to see you today

895
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,140
just to say sorry.

896
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,420
It was wrong of me to deceive you,

897
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,660
but I truly didn't want
to disappoint you.

898
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,740
But what if one day I disappoint you?

899
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,420
I'm afraid you'll regret

900
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,740
abandoning everything for me.

901
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,220
I won't regret it.

902
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,900
Bad news!

903
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,340
Bad news!

904
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,140
Xiaolu.

905
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,500
Guangnan is in trouble.

906
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,020
Have you heard of the boy cried wolf?

907
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,380
No, this time it's real.

908
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,580
It's really real.

909
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,420
What does it matter to me
whether it's real or not?

910
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,340
Quite impressive.

911
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,500
Good acting.

912
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,500
Nice costume. Where did you rent them?

913
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,900
Watch your manners in front of Ms. Tao.

914
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,380
This extra is pretty good too.

915
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,980
Is this enough already?

916
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,460
Hurry up and bring Li Guangnan out.

917
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,540
I really want to ask him face-to-face.

918
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,140
Isn't he tired of

919
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,820
using this trick?

920
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,780
How much did Li Guangnan give you?

921
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,930
You are acting so diligently.

922
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,820
You rented a KTV room,

923
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,780
put on a leather jacket,

924
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,380
and started to

925
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,940
act tough in front of me.

926
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,500
You think I'm a fool?

927
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,340
Move!

928
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,340
Move again, I dare you.

929
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,260
Sit down first.

930
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,660
Xiaolu,

931
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,860
it's been a long time since

932
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,420
someone dared to talk to me like this.

933
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,940
What's her name again?

934
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,420
Luo Chuntao?

935
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,140
What are you doing, Lu Dajiang?

936
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,100
Sit down!

937
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,020
Underground people call her Ms. Tao.

938
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,980
What underground people?

939
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,100
How did you get to know her?

940
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,490
Li Guangnan was selling milk tea
at the entrance of her karaoke bar.

941
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,780
The security guard wouldn't let him sell,

942
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,860
and even turned over his stall.

943
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,260
He ended up arguing with them.

944
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,300
And then I went there.

945
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,540
Your name is Lu Xiaolu

946
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,620
and you are Lu Dajiang's cousin, right?

947
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,820
Yes, I'm Lu Xiaolu.

948
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,020
Lu Dajiang is my cousin.

949
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,340
I've seen you when you were little.

950
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,100
But now I don't recognize you anymore.

951
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,700
You've seen me before?

952
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,780
How come I don't remember you?

953
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,340
It's been too long.

954
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,060
Feels like it's from a previous life.

955
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,860
But why does Lu Dajiang

956
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,460
always avoid me?

957
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,020
How about this?

958
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,940
Bring him here,

959
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,300
and I'll release him immediately.

960
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,460
My cousin is in prison,

961
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,180
sentenced to five years.

962
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,620
Now he can completely avoid me.

963
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,740
Five years, right?

964
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,020
No problem.

965
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,540
I'll wait for him.

966
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,620
Dajiang,

967
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,740
you are clearly her target.

968
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,500
Could it be your enemy?

969
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,580
Not an enemy,

970
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,420
worse than that.

971
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,220
Worse than that?

972
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,540
Dajiang,

973
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,780
could she be the old lover of yours

974
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,060
you mentioned?

975
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,820
Don't cause trouble for her.

976
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,900
It's not easy for a girl like her.

977
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,780
Inside the cabinet under the TV
in my boathouse,

978
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,020
there's a metal box.

979
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,100
Show her what's inside.

980
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,100
That's all I can do for you.

981
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,780
I don't know if it'll help.

982
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,540
Does he have anything to tell me?

983
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,620
I'm not even worthy of receiving
a single word from him, am I?

984
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,540
He deserves to be in there.

985
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,980
It's best if he never gets out of prison.

986
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,100
If my cousin did something

987
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,580
to hurt you back then,

988
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,380
I apologize on his behalf.

989
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,260
Can you please
release Li Guangnan first?

990
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,540
When I was 15,

991
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,460
some thugs tried to take advantage of me,

992
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,940
but Lu Dajiang came to my aid.

993
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,940
He wasn't even 20 at the time,

994
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,340
wearing a leather jacket

995
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,900
and the white scarf I gave him.

996
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,020
Don't run!

997
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,420
Get him!

998
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,260
The fight was quite intense.

999
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,340
To protect me,

1000
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,980
his white scarf
was stained red with blood.

1001
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,620
But he still won in the end.

1002
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,580
Later, he said to me,

1003
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,380
"Follow me in the future.

1004
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,700
I can protect you."

1005
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,980
And then he took me everywhere with him.

1006
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,260
We drove illegal taxis, polished shoes,

1007
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,620
and even sold cigarettes.

1008
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,820
He also told me

1009
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,660
he would marry me

1010
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,620
once he earned enough money.

1011
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,660
Your cousin is quite honorable,

1012
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,780
often lending money to his friends.

1013
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,740
But suddenly one day,

1014
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,300
he got into a fight
with someone he lent money to

1015
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,220
and injured them,

1016
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,980
and he just ran away and left me behind.

1017
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,780
My cousin went to Hong Kong.

1018
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,620
I know,

1019
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,300
after he came back,

1020
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,100
I heard that he went to Hong Kong.

1021
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,540
But have you ever thought

1022
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,180
that he didn't want to leave you,

1023
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,580
but rather didn't want to involve you?

1024
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,020
Then why didn't he tell me?

1025
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,100
Couldn't I go to Hong Kong to find him?

1026
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,020
This is something between the two of us.

1027
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,340
Why did he make decisions on his own?

1028
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,340
He simply didn't care

1029
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,660
about what I was thinking.

1030
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,140
Enough, let's not talk about this.

1031
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,580
Stay here tonight

1032
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,980
and have a drink with me.

Do you think my place is alright?

Amazing! Grand!

1044
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,860
Nice beer!

1045
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,300
So, in the future, if my karaoke

1046
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,340
only serves your beverages, how's that?

1047
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,220
Are you serious, Ms. Tao?

1048
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,740
If you become our client,

1049
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,660
we'll thrive.

1050
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,500
Yeah!

1051
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,620
Alright.

1052
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,660
Listen to me.

1053
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,340
To show sincerity, I'll finish this bottle.

1054
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,380
Oh, no need.

1055
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,260
I want him to drink.

1056
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,540
It's the same.

1057
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,540
Yeah, Ms. Tao.

1058
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,980
Your cousin never gets drunk.

1059
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,740
Do you have his drinking capacity?

1060
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,980
Listen,

1061
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,300
whether we can
make this deal tonight or not

1062
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,140
depends on your sincerity.

1063
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,780
Well, our sincerity is definitely enough.

1064
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,980
I'll drink!

1065
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,740
He downed it, Ms. Tao, not a drop left.

1066
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,900
Let's have one together.

1067
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,540
Ms. Tao, it's a great day today.

1068
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,860
I'll have another one!

1069
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,300
- Come on.
- Together!

1070
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,220
Cheers!

1071
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,780
Lu Xiaolu!

1072
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,030
What?

1073
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:28,940
You are so noisy.

1074
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,420
You... you're my

1075
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,900
best friend

1076
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,820
in this world.

1077
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,420
Can you wait until you're sober
before confessing?

1078
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,340
Nope, I have to say it now.

1079
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,660
I still remember when I came here,

1080
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,220
everyone avoided me,

1081
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,420
saying that I came from the countryside,

1082
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,860
calling me poor and unsophisticated.

1083
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,100
But you,

1084
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,580
you didn't avoid me.

1085
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,860
You played with me.

1086
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,540
I love you so much.

1087
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,780
You are disgusting, you know?

1088
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,900
Believe it or not,

1089
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,420
I will...

1090
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,180
Lu Xiaolu.

1091
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,540
I just knew

1092
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,340
you wouldn't abandon me.

1093
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,540
Li Guangnan.

1094
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,380
Yeah?

1095
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,300
We're lifelong good brothers,

1096
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,900
but do you know why

1097
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,820
I must save you this time?

1098
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,260
Why?

1099
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,340
Because if you're doing well,

1100
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,020
then I can leave with peace of mind.

1101
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,220
Alright.

1102
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,940
