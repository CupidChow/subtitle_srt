24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,370
Huang Qing is really a jerk.

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,180
He has no humanity at all,

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,650
abandoning even his own woman.

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,730
He won't come.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,420
You are just wasting your time.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,940
You will surely be useful.

30
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,330
Although Huang Qing abandoned you,

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,500
there's still Lu Xiaolu.

32
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,610
What's Lu Xiaolu's phone number?

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,010
Lu Xiaolu and I
parted ways a long time ago.

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,270
Don't pretend with me.

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,750
I've got your phone.

36
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,730
What's the password?

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,980
I'll find it myself.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,700
- I deleted his number.
- Boss Hu,

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
are you looking for me?

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,450
Lu Xiaolu, I knew you would come.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Release her first.

42
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,170
Let's talk about money.

43
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,850
I don't trust anyone now.

44
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,540
Because of the trouble you caused,

45
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,570
I gained nothing.

46
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,660
Huang Qing has fled now.

47
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,770
You give me the 300,000 yuan
he promised me,

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,660
and you can take her away.

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,270
Okay.

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
Release her first,

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,420
and I'll get the money for you.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,140
Are you trying to pull a fast one?

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,420
I'll release her when I get the money.

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,100
Don't tell me
you don't have 300,000 yuan.

55
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,620
You are a big boss.

56
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,500
You have two hours.

57
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,420
Go back and get it.

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,820
If I don't see the money,

59
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,180
your little lover will suffer.

60
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,060
Don't touch her.

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,420
What?

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,740
Want to fight?

63
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,380
If you don't want to be disabled,

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,420
go back and bring me the money.

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,620
My wife's paralyzed because of you!

66
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,820
Nobody moves!

67
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,820
Don't move!

68
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,460
Li Guangnan!

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,220
How dare you attack me!

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,460
- Hit him!
- Come here if you wanna die!

71
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,620
Don't move!

72
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,580
Xiaolu!

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,940
Boss Hu,

74
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,060
your old friend is here to see you.

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,340
I've been waiting for this chance.

76
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,380
Dajiang,

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
why are you here?

78
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,740
Boss Hu and I are old friends.

79
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,860
Of course I should bid him farewell.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,500
You came by yourself?

81
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,060
Are you also here

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,940
to play the hero and save the beauty?

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,820
You voluntarily came here.

84
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,180
Don't blame me for being heartless.

85
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,700
I didn't come here to fight.

86
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,300
I'm here to apologize.

87
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,980
Let's talk things out properly.

88
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,860
Just release them.

89
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,420
Apologize, huh?

90
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,180
Leave your fingers behind.

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,220
One finger for one person.

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,300
Let me cut off three,

93
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,500
and you can take them away.

94
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,180
Fine.

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,980
No problem.

96
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,980
Dajiang!

97
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,540
Boss, here is the chopper.

98
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,660
Lu Dajiang,

99
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,780
I admire you.

100
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,220
Dajiang!

101
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,220
Go!

102
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,620
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Go!

104
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,060
Dajiang, the chopper!

105
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,660
We've called the police.
You can't escape.

106
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,180
Xiaolu,

107
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
take them and go.

108
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,620
Xiaolu!

109
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,900
Let's go.

110
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,180
Dajiang,

111
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,740
the police are here. You should go.

112
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,060
Go find Ms. Tao.

113
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,460
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

114
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,500
I'm really fine.

115
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,620
Take care of her.

116
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,900
Have a safe journey.

117
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,420
- I'll come visit you soon.
- Sure.

(Dajiang,)

120
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,420
(just like in Fucheng,)

121
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,500
(there's a beautiful dock here.)

122
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,420
(The only difference
is that it snows in May.)

123
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,180
(I hope one day)

124
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,740
(you'll be able to see it too.)

(Hu Dafa)

(has long organized
and led a criminal gang,)

128
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,760
- (engaging in activities)
- Get in.

129
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
(such as kidnapping,)

130
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,070
(intentional injury,
and provocation of troubles,)

131
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,440
(which seriously disrupted)

132
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,780
(the economic and social order
of Fucheng City.)

133
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,190
(Hu Dafa has been lawfully arrested)

134
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,700
(and charged with organizing
and leading a criminal gang)

135
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,400
(and kidnapping, among other offenses.)

136
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,020
Looks like

137
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,900
it's really time to say goodbye
to this place.

138
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,020
Are you surprised?

139
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,660
No.

140
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Bi and Huang Qing have been
brought to justice.

141
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,620
Since the government promised

142
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,700
to reimburse the workers
with the land sale proceeds,

143
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,020
this outcome is inevitable.

144
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,220
You can't go back to your company.

145
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
So what are your plans next?

146
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,820
I plan to study abroad

147
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,060
to see the world.

148
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,500
And you?

149
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,420
I plan to

150
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,620
continue the milk tea business.

151
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,500
If it goes well,

152
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,660
I'll open a chain store

153
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,660
and hire all the workers.

154
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,260
You haven't changed
after all these years.

155
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,780
Don't you think about yourself?

156
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,500
(Not selling land, abstaining, selling land)

157
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,300
The world is yours now.

158
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,540

161

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,340

190

(Blue Road)

193
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,970
This way, please.

194
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,420
I really didn't expect that

195
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,860
you would choose to

196
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,460
have your final meal here before leaving.

197
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,940
Remember when we used to

198
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,140
talk about coming here to eat?

199
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,460
Then we never had the chance.

200
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,940
Today, we're making up for it.

201
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,460
Do you remember

202
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,180
that time
we had dinner with our classmates

203
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,340
from the postgraduate class?

204
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,940
You ordered an eighty percent well steak.

205
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,660
Of course, I remember.

206
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,620
You protected my dignity.

207
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,340
But in the end,

208
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,660
neither of us got to eat.

209
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,580
Yes. What did we end up eating?

210
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,140
Fish balls?

211
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,540
Fish ball soup?

212
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,380
Right.

213
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,500
Fish ball soup.

214
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,220
So, do you want to

215
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,380
try an eighty percent well steak today?

216
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,820
Give it a try?

217
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,260
- These two appetizers.
- Okay.

218
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,820
- This Burgundy wine.
- Okay.

219
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,340
Plus two eighty percent well
sirloin steaks.

220
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,660
Eighty percent well?

221
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,140
Are you sure?

222
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,940
I'm sure.

223
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,340
Okay, let me check with the kitchen.

224
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,420
- Okay.
- Please wait a moment.

225
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,340
Do you think they can make it?

226
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,380
If the chef won't make it for us,

227
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,540
we'll do it ourselves.

228
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,140
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

229
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,860
Sir,

230
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,380
no problem, it can be made.

231
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,460
Two eighty percent well steaks,

232
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,300
right?

233
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,660
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

234
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,620
It's my duty.

235
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,500
Just now, our chef told me that

236
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,940
he makes eighty percent well steak

237
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,140
at least once a year,

238
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,180
so he's very skilled.

239
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,340
Please rest assured.

240
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,900
It looks like someone shares our taste.

241
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,260
What a coincidence.

242
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,160
Let me tell you some good news.

243
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,980
Just yesterday,

244
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,060
a big customer called me.

245
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,140
Guess who it was?

246
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,090
Afang.

247
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,440
How did you know?

248
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,580
Since the last time

249
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,420
you gave her the milk tea powder,

250
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,280
I had a feeling.

251
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,670
But if it were me, I would also

252
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,830
be willing to cooperate with you.

253
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,760
I believe that before long,

254
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,850
everything will get better and better.

255
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,880
Will you

256
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,980
come back then?

257
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,050
Who knows?

258
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,780
Yeah.

259
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,100

You are fully recovered, huh?

373
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
Just another month,

374
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,940
and I'll be able
to get rid of this wheelchair.

375
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,260
- That's great.
- Fantastic.

376
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,460
If I were you,

377
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,340
I'd pretend not to recover

378
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,840
and have Li Guangnan
take care of me for life.

379
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,620
Wouldn't that be nice?

380
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,940
Who cares about him?

381
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
He annoys me every day.

382
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,300
I can take care of myself.

383
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,020
Oh, Big Feet, congratulations to you.

384
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,660
I wish you a great married life.

385
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,030
And congratulations on
finally being able to stand up.

386
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,740
Where is Bai Lan?

387
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,500
She should be here soon.

388
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
She said she would come.

389
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,700
I'm handing Xiaoying over to you.

390
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Don't mistreat her.

391
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,100
Of course.

392
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,980
Don't worry, Master.

393
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,140
Sorry, Dad.

394
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Be careful.

395
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,100
Next up, let's welcome our groom,

396
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,180
Mr. Chen Guowei,

397
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,300
to deliver a speech.

398
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,780
Bravo!

399
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,940
Come on. Be confident.

400
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,580
Hello, everyone.

401
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,420
I'm Chen Guowei.

402
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,620
Today is

403
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,820
the wedding between Niu Xiaoying and me.

404
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,220
Thank you all for coming.

405
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,060
Great!

406
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,100
My father-in-law,

407
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,460
also my most respected master,

408
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
has asked me to give a wedding speech.

409
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,780
I've written a lot of

410
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,700
heartfelt words for Xiaoying,

411
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,580
but there are too many words

412
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,220
and I can't remember them all,

413
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,580
so I brought notes.

414
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,020
Oh, I forgot to take it.

415
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,780
As you all know,

416
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm

417
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,500
not very good at speaking.

418
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,260
- No, we don't know.
- We don't know that.

419
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,100
We really don't know.

420
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,940
You do,

421
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,140
and Xiaoying does too.

422
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,540
And,

423
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,140
I've always

424
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
wanted to be a singer.

425
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,420
Even though I failed,

426
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,260
I've always felt that

427
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,060
I sing better than I speak.

428
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,900
So today,

429
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,280
at my wedding, I want to

430
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,100
sing a song

431
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,700
for Xiaoying
and all our family and friends.

432
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,820
Great!

433
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,860
This song

434
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,340
is a tribute

435
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,060
to our shared youth.

436
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,860
The song is called

437
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,140

Little Pouter,

525
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,100
since I first saw you

526
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,500
in junior high,

527
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,300
I've started to like you.

528
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,020
I, Li Guangnan, have liked you

529
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,540
for fourteen years!

530
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,100
What fourteen years?

531
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,180
Just thirteen years.

532
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,460
You've always been exaggerating.

533
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,700
Juan,

534
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,580
I love you.

535
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,620
Great!

536
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,500
Do you remember?

537
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,900
The first day we met,

538
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,460
I was holding that tape recorder

539
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,980
helping Li Guangnan confess.

540
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,180
Then we got into a fight,

541
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,660
I saw you

542
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,150
and took your suitcase.

543
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,940
Of course I remember,

544
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,820
you used my suitcase to fight

545
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,060
and broke it.

546
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,940
Later, I testified against you
to the police,

547
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,480
causing you
to miss the college entrance exam.

548
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,660
It was a chaotic day

549
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,460
but also the most

550
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,940
unforgettable one for me.

551
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,790
Me too.

552
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,620
Look,

553
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,220
who are those coming over there?

554
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,940
I miss them so much.

555
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,180
Beer, peanuts, melon seeds, mineral water.

556
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,340
Beer, peanuts, melon seeds, mineral water.

557
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,100
Excuse me,

558
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,540
where are we?

559
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,580
Do you have melon seeds?

560
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,500
Yes.

561
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,420
I'll take a pack of them.

562
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,060
This is the train
from Fucheng to Shanghai.

563
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,020
What year is it now?

564
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,220
You are not totally awake?

565
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,140
I feel like I had

566
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,180
a very long dream.

567
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,180
Yes,

568
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,140
you were smiling

569
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,780
in your sleep just now.

570
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,540
We'll reach Shanghai station

571
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,900
in thirty minutes.

572
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,420
Shanghai station
is the final stop of this train.

573
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,820
Please prepare to get off.

594
