According to the police station's notice,

the raincoat pervert appeared again

at the three-way intersection

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,220
500 meters west of the factory last night.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,700
Currently, the police are making
every effort to solve this case.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
I hope

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,020
all female workers in our factory
stay safe.

Why won't this person disappear?

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
(Security Department)
I heard the flasher has appeared again.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,090
I want to confirm the time with you.

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,620
It should have been around

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,530
9 o'clock last night.

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,060
Then it wasn't Lu Xiaolu.

40
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,540
How do you know?

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,660
We were together at that time.

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,300
After we sent the German expert away,

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,740
we went to the Good Cat Stall.

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,340
Dr. Bai,

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,300
can I ask you a question?

46
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,220
Is Lu Xiaolu bothering you?

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,540
If so, tell me,

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,060
and I'll keep him away from you.

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,460
There's no need for that.

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
I actually misunderstood him before.

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,620
If needed,

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,180
I can vouch for his innocence.

53
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,380
Okay.

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,180
Dr. Bai,

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,060
actually,

56
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,380
I didn't

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,100
believe it was Lu Xiaolu
from the beginning.

58
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,140
I've practically watched him grow up.

59
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,820
When he was young,

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,020
although he was lively,

61
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,860
he often helped the elderly
in our factory

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,220
by carrying things around

63
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,460
and running errands.

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,140
He's a good-hearted kid.

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,340
He wouldn't do that.

66
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,140
Of course,

67
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,500
solving the case
can't just rely on feelings, right?

68
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,220
You're right.

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,180
We need to find the real flasher

70
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,180
to clear Xiaolu's suspicion.

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,460
Right.

- Don't run!

75
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,540
What are you doing here?

76
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,540
It's so dangerous.

77
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,700
I have quicklime.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,180
I'll sprinkle it on him
when he gets close.

79
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,420
Your plan is not so great.

80
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,500
Stop talking and chase him!

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,340
Stop running!

83
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,900
Are you serious?

84
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,260
Do you have to yell so loudly?

85
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,820
You startled me.

86
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,620
That was my trick.

87
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,500
Whenever my dad hit me, it hurt a lot,

88
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,860
so I would scream

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,740
really loudly,

90
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,540
and then he wouldn't hit me so hard.

91
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,580
Actually, it didn't hurt at all.

92
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,420
Is that so?

93
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,980

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
No, I won't.

97
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,100
Oh,

98
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,660
your butt is bleeding!

99
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,620

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm also trying to save you.

104

Oh well, forget it.

105
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Just ignore it.

106
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
I'm fine now.

107
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,460
I didn't expect you
to be quite conservative.

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,780
My butt can only be shown
to my future wife.

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,460
How can I let you see it?

110
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,540
Will you marry me?

111
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,020
I'm a doctor,

112

I've seen many butts,

113
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,100
do I need to marry every patient?

114
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,540
If you don't want me to check, forget it.

115
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,860
What are you doing?

116
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,460
Nothing.

117
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,140
You had dust in your hair.

118
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,300
I wanted to blow it off for you.

119
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,220
Then help me get the electric fan.

120
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,260
You're quite clever.

121
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,340
Here.

122
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,340
Is it clean now?

123
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,340
Yes, much cleaner.

124
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,540
Isn't this great?

125
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,860
Do you finally believe

126
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,460
I'm not that pervert?

127
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,620
But I think today's person

128
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,020
is not the same as last time.

129
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,380
What do you mean?

130
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,580
Exhibitionism
is a psychological disorder.

131
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,780
Generally speaking,

132
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,460
their behavioral patterns don't change.

133
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,820
But today, this person

134
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,300
had no intention of flashing.

135
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,340
He attacked me with a stick right away.

136
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,220
And when I struggled with him,

137
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,180
I noticed his body was soft.

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,940
But the person from last time

139
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,300
had well-developed muscles.

140
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,860
I understand.

141
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,620
You must have suspected it was me

142
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,300
because he had great muscles.

143
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Lu Xiaolu,

144
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,900
you're shameless.

145
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,030
No wonder you've been beaten
since you were little.

146
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,180
Actually, you are wrong.

147
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,020
No one could beat me since I was little.

148
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,940
That just means
you've been beaten too little,

149
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,980
that's why you are so annoying now.

150
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,340
I've always been annoying.

151
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,500
I think you knew it well.

152
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,780
It hurts!

153
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,900
You are less annoying now.

154
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,900
Are you crazy?

155
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,660
That hurt so much!

Oh, perfect timing.

159
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,420
I've discovered a new way to eat.

160
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,340
Ham sausage is perfect with it.

161
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,180
Want one?

162
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,660
I'll pass.

163
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,100
I have something to ask you.

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,980
- What's up?
- Look at this.

165
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980

166
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,980
Dr. Bai,

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,780
I'm old now.

168
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,180
Don't joke with me like this.

169
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,820
The security department is watching.

170
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,220
This was from that pervert.

171
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,780
I don't have this.

172
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,180
Birth control supplies

173
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,340
are always kept
by the trade union Chairwoman.

174
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,540
She's friendly and will

175
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,100
give them to anyone who asks.

176
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,100
You should

177
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,100
talk to her about this.

178
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,100
- Is it good?
- Yes.

179
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,340
I'm going to the medical room then.

180
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,180
Okay.

181
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,620
Three bamboos.

182
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,140
- Wait.
- Mom, Aunties.

183
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,540
Hey, Xiaolu,

184
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,700
- why are you back?
- You are back.

185
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,380
I came back to get some clean clothes.

186
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,660
Wait for me to finish this game,
and I'll get them for you.

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,620
Just focus on your mahjong.
I'll get them.

188
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,420
Look how considerate Xiaolu is.

189
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,980
You don't need to worry about him.

190
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,220
Oh yes.

191
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,780
My son has been

192
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,620
playing with him

193
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,020
all the time.

194
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,540
He's smart. South.

195
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,460
I wonder who will be

196
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,340
so lucky to marry him in the future.

197
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,740
Not you for sure.

198
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,300
Excuse me, is this
Chairwoman Zhao Lizhen's house?

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,860
Who is it? Come in.

200
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,210
- Give me Five Characters.
- Alright, take it.

201
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,070
Five Characters?

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,140
- Hey, I, I...
- Who is it?

203
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,100
- Six Characters.
- Chairwoman Zhao.

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,780
Are you the new Dr. Bai?

205
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,540
We are playing mahjong.

206
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,700
Hey, these ladies

207
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,020
are all from our factory

208
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,180
and have been here for a long time.

209
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,780
You came to...

210
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,240
I went to the union this morning
to find you.

211
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,420
They said you weren't feeling well

212
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,740
and were resting at home.

213
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,820
Do you need me to check on you?

214
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,100
It's nothing.

215
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,900
It's just my son.

216
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
He moved to the factory.

217
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,620
I'm not happy about it

218
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,980
and can't eat much.

219
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,220
My stomach hurts.

220
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,500
It's an old problem.

221
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
I just needed some rest.

222
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,020
Thank you for asking.

223
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,100
Come on, have a seat.

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,500
Oh, is there something wrong?

225
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,820
It's like this.

226
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,300
I heard that the birth control supplies

227
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,580
are kept with you, right?

228
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,460
Ah, yes.

229
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,700
They're in that room.

230
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,180
In that room?

231
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,060
You are new here,

232
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,980
so you don't know.

233
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,460
Let me explain.

234
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,660
There are many

235
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,100
middle-aged workers in the factory

236
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,540
and some young workers.

237
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,380
During the day,

238
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,780
they feel embarrassed to come

239
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
to my office to get them,

240
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,020
so I thought of an idea.

241
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,420
I moved these birth control

242
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,820
supplies home.

243
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
When they finish work,

244
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,540
they come quietly to get them.

245
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,020
This way, it avoids embarrassing them.

246
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,180
It's been working well like this.

247
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,340
Can I see the claim records?

248
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,440
What?

249
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,420
Records?

250
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,180
How can there be records for this?

251
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,460
This is a private matter

252
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,780
for couples.

253
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,100
I can't keep a...

254
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,320
According to regulations,

255
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,320
birth control supplies should be kept
by the medical room,

256
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,780
and every transaction should be
clearly recorded.

257
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,380
This way, we have a

258
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,540
clear trail for audits.

259
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,500
What are you implying?

260
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,380
Are you suggesting
I'm abusing my authority?

261
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,020
I didn't mean it that way.

262
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,220
But these are factory items,

263
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,820
not personal items.

264
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,980
Hey, why are you speaking like this?

265
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,540
Talking about factory and private items,

266
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,780
and you say you don't mean that?

267
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,180
I think you did mean it.

268
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,220
If that's what you're implying,

269
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,020
then let me tell you,

270
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,380
I, Zhao Lizhen,

271
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,540
have always been

272
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,580
diligent,

273
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,740
honest,

274
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,900
and willing to take on any task.

275
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,580
I've never engaged in any

276
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,500
underhanded dealings.

277
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,420
That's right.

278
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,300
Even the factory director
turns a blind eye to it,

279
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,220
you, a newcomer, why are you

280
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,580
acting so high and mighty?

281
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,660
Dr. Bai,

282
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,740
you're new here

283
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,730
and might not fully understand the situation
in the factory.

284
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,940
It's best to watch what you say.

285
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,060
We all know Chairwoman Zhao's

286
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,340
character very well.

287
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,300
Since there are no records,

288
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,380
I won't disturb you further.

289
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,610
I'll move the items back
to the medical room another day

290
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,820
to avoid misunderstandings.

291
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,460
- Well...
- What are you implying?

292
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,940
Are you threatening me?

293
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,180
Hey, why are you

294
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,780
speaking out of turn like this?

295
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,580
You should learn

296
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,220
some manners.

297
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,740
It's up to you
how you want to interpret this.

298
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,580
I'm just following regulations.

299
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,980
What are you doing?

300
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,980
I should ask you that question!

301
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,220
Do you think I was going to jump off?

302
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,500
(Gongyuan)

303
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,900
No one wants to live more than I do.

304
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,860
Even if you don't admit it,

305
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,740
I know

306
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,620
someone as proud as you

307
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
would feel ashamed to let others know

308
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,340
you have thoughts of dying.

309
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,180
I promise I won't tell anyone,

310
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,500
but you must never do something
like that again.

311
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,060
Even if others don't understand you,

312
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,020
I know

313
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,860
you're not the person they think you are.

314
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,780
You're not selfish at all.

315
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,340
Don't think you know me.

316
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,300
I am selfish.

317
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,220
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

318
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,060
- No, you're definitely not.
- Yes, I am.

319
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,700
I said you're not, so you're not.

320
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,780
I believe in you.

321
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
What is that room?

322
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,780
The...

323
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,180
The administrative office.

324
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
What's up?

325
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,420
I just saw a man

326
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,740
bullying a woman,

327
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,540
but then they disappeared.

328
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,100
It's fine if you don't want to accept me.

329
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,740
There's no need to come up with
such a lame excuse.

330
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,420
Do I need an excuse to reject you?

331
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,420
If you're not in a good mood,

332
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,820
how about
we go out together this weekend?

333
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,940
My cousin's ice skating rink
opens at 7:30.

334
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,740
Say my name at the door
for free admission.

335
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,740
It's a deal then.

336
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,380
I'll be there. See you then.

337
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,980
Yes!

338
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,220
(Dajiang Skate Land)
Come on, dear friends!

339
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,660
It's the first day of
Dajiang Skate Land's opening!

340
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,620
Have fun!

341
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
Welcome! Come in!

342
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,580
You'll get a discount.

343
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,320
(Celebrating the opening of the skate land)
Come in, come in! Welcome!

344
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,300
Come in, please.

345
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,460
Hey, where's your girlfriend?

346
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,300
You haven't got her yet?

347
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,700
Hey, Xiaolu!

348
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,180
Slow down.

349
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,460
You might fall flat on your face.

350
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,660
Can't you lend me a hand?

351
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,580
Why did you come alone?

352
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,580
Where's Li Guangnan?

353
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,380
How would I know where he is?

354
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,940
Hey, change your shoes

355
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,820
and teach me.

356
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,940
I can't teach you.

357
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,020
Ask Li Guangnan to teach you.

358
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,100
He's good at it.

359
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,380
You'll teach better than him for sure.

360
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,220
Let's go.

361
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,940
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey, slow down.

362
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,220
That girl likes Xiaolu.

363
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,300
You sit down first.

364
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,580
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

365
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,820
Dear friends,

366
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,540
Dajiang Skate Land is officially open!

367
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,820
Thank you all for coming to support me.

368
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,540
We not only have
the latest generation of ice skates,

369
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,660
but also unlimited beer and soda.

370
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,260
To celebrate our opening,

371
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,980
we'll be hosting the Dajiang Cup

372
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,300
Skating Competition at 8 o'clock tonight.

373
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,580
Bravo!

374
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,100
The winner will receive

375
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,340
a one-year free pass.

376
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,620
Great!

377
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,980
We hope everyone will participate!

378
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,540
You've brought the girl,

379
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,060
show us some moves now.

380
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,460
Dajiang, you misunderstood.

381
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,980
I'm not joining the competition.

382
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,460
If I do,

383
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,660
no one else will have a chance to win.

384
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,220
That's true.

385
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,140
Can I try?

386
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
It's you!

387
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,420
What? Not happy to see me?

388
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
Everyone's welcome.

389
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
Please.

Someone harassed me.

416
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,580
Sit down first.

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,420
Lu Xiaolu!

418
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,660
Let go.

420
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,060
- What are you doing?
- Was it you who

421
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,140
left two movie tickets on my bed

422
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,320
and tricked me to go watch a movie?

423
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,060
What movie tickets?

424
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,220
What are you talking about?

425
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,860
It's a joyous occasion.

426
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,260
I brought my brothers here

427
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,660
to liven things up.

428
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,060
What if I say you are not welcome?

429
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,980
No matter if we are welcome,

430
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,660
we paid for our tickets.

431
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,340
You are here looking for trouble!

432
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,540
Lu Dajiang,

433
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,820
do you despise my brothers?

434
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,180
Honestly,

435
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,100
you might not win
in a head-to-head confrontation.

436
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,980
Laowu, the knife.

437
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,860
Boss, the knife is in the bike.

438
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,700
I left it there after peeling apples.

439
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I have a hundred ways to deal with you.

440
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,060
What are you doing?

441
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,620
- Light it up!
- Put it down!

442
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,020
- I'll really light it.
- Calm down.

443
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,980
Put it down.

444
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,020
Boss Hu!

445
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,900
Let's talk things out.

446
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,340
You're still making excuses.

447
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,560
You just want to date Little Pouter.

448
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
- Li Guangnan, let go.
- It's not like that, Li Guangnan.

449
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,700
What are you doing?

450
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,180
I put the movie tickets there.

What are you saying?

484
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,620
I've told you, I've been wronged.

485
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,780
You were already dating Little Pouter,

486
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,220
and you're still saying
you've been wronged?

487
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,860
You treat her like a treasure

488
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,180
but I don't.

489
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,980
The person I wanted to date

490
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,060
wasn't her at all.

491
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,460
It was me?

492
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,780
You wanted me to watch you fight?

493
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,460
Okay. You can leave.

494
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,300
It's done.

495
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,580
Let's go.

496
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,100
Come on.

497
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,420
Let's go!

498
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,900
But on another note,

499
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,660
you did pretty well today,

500
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,380
especially after drinking.

501
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,420
It was like a transformation,

502
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,180
just like that Sailor Moon thing.

503
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,100
Seems like you've done
this kind of thing before.

504
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
What do you think?

505
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,980
Let's stop talking and leave.

506
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,820
Wait a minute.

507
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,300
(Gongyuan)

508
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,260
Xiaolu,

509
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
I know that

510
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,340
your family is better off than mine,

511
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,780
and you're better looking than me.

512
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,420
If Little Pouter really likes you

513
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
and you're interested in her,

514
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,700
I'll back out.

515
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,100
You're my best bro,

516
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,660
and I don't want to fall out with you

517
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,540
over a woman.

518
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,980
You don't have to back out.

519
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,780
The person I like isn't her.

520
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,260
But she doesn't like me.

521
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,220
She's always cold to me.

522
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,220
But you still like her, right?

523
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Of course.

524
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,820
If you like someone,

525
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,460
you have to stick with it.

526
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,860
Don't give up.

527
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,180
But what if I'm 40

528
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,900
and she still doesn't like me?

529
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,300
Then you...

530
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,580
...just give up.

531
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,660
Give up?

532
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,060
Then who should I choose?

533
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,700
Xiaoying.

534
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,620
I think Xiaoying is pretty good.

535
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,380
She's like one of the guys.

536
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
She's probably not going

537
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,260
to get married by 40.

538
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,780
Forget it. I still want to

539
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,820
have a better old age.

540
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,980
Come on,

541
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,220
Xiaoying is great.

542
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,860
Think about it, she's kind,

543
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,660
righteous, and in good shape.

544
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm telling you,

545
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,860
she's the most special woman

546
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,100
in the world.

547
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,140
You really should...

548
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,980
You... You...

549
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,700
What are you doing here?

550
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,660
Lu Xiaolu,

551
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,200
you should say those things to my face.

552
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,260
Don't say that behind my back.

553
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
I like being praised.

554
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,940
Here.

555
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,260
Take it.

556
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,860
It's braised beef I made myself.

557
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,220
I'll come find you again.

558
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,620
Again?

559
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,340
Now I think

560
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Xiaoying is not bad.
Why don't you consider her?

561
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,300
I...

562
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,140
Take it. It's all yours.

563
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,580
But it's for you.

564
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,900
(Don't take what belongs to others,
or I'll be after you every day.)

565
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,800
Xiaoying,

566
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,980
why are you dressed like this today?

567
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,860
Are you getting married?

568
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,940
Your mom is getting married!

569
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,100
My mom wouldn't dress like this
at her wedding.

570
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,820
Why are you dressed like a female spy?

571
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,020
Hey, Master,

572
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,260
what's wrong with your daughter today?

573
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,980
Look at her.

574
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,540
Don't say that.

575
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,060
Don't say that.

576
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,140
You will never get meat in the canteen.

577
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,580
You look really good.

578
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,740
Dad. Dad.

579
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,340
Don't call me dad.

580
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,100
Why are you dressed like this?

581
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,660
Don't you feel awkward?

582
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,820
Don't you? Don't you?

583
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,020
You get so drunk every night

584
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,140
that you can barely walk!

585
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,020
Don't you feel awkward?

586
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,860
I... You...

587
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
It...

588
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,900
It's for me?

589
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,920
Just take it.

590
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,500
Throw it away if you don't like it.

591
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,220
You too,

592
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,820
feel free to throw it away.

593
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,940
I...

594
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,220
That's enough.

595
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
Just hang in there.

596
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,460
You should pretend a little longer.

597
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,660
It just lasted for three minutes.

598
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,140
You're envious?

599
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,940
That beef looks really good.

600
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,940
Lu Xiaolu,

601
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I have something to tell you.

602
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,860
What is it?

603
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,340
Do what you do now.

604
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,940
Let's talk in private later.

605
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,940
Here, eat this.

606
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,540
Xiaolu,

607
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,020
you're such a good friend.

608
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,260
Thank you so much.

609
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,300
The person who stuffed

610
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,980
the threatening letter
into your door crack

611
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,740
must be someone from the factory.

612
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,740
With so many people in the factory,

613
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,540
why target me specifically?

614
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,740
Don't you think you easily offend people?

615
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,620
Don't take what belongs to others,

616
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,900
or I'll be after you every day.

617
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
What's this?

618
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,380
An old booger?

619
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,700
Lu Xiaolu!

620
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,340
Black sesame seeds.

621
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,940
These are only used

622
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,340
in the walnut cake workshop.

623
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,380
It'll be like finding a needle

624
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,660
in a haystack to look for track him.

625
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,060
We don't need to do that.

626
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,060
He'll come to us.

627
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,820
(Don't take what belongs to others,
or I'll be after you every day.)

628
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,820
(Lost and Found)

629
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,260
Have you seen anyone
who looks like that flasher?

630
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,180
No, I haven't.

631
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,820
Do you think he'll come today?

632
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,780
Have you read Conan Doyle's novels?

633
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,940
What about them?

634
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,900
Confident killers

635
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,660
often return to the scene of the crime,

636
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,580
while timid ones

637
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,020
usually destroy all evidence.

638
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,060
This flasher doesn't dare show his face.

639
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,020
He only uses threatening letters,

640
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,740
which shows he's a coward.

641
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,980
Looks like you've read a lot of books.

642
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,100
My dad is a librarian.

643
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,300
I spent every summer vacation
at the library.

644
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,860
If you didn't miss
the college entrance exam,

645
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,300
would you have become a top student?

646
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,700
Hard to say.

647
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,540
Now, do you think

648
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm quite impressive?

649
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,860
Do you kind of like me?

650
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,780
Stop being conceited.

651
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,540
It's going to rain.

652
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,020
Will he still come?

653
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,700
Perfect.

654
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,040
(Lost and Found)

655
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,020
(Don't take what belongs to others,
or I'll be after you every day.)

656
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,780
Someone's here.

657
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
- I'll go.
- Hey, don't be impulsive.

658
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,780
He doesn't look like that flasher.

659
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,300
He's gone.

660
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,780
Doesn't seem like
we'll have any luck today.

661
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,780
Let's go.

662
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,500
Let's wait a little longer.

663
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,900
Night shift is about to end.

664
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,140
Alright.

665
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,500
