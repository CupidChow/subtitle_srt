Amidst the fragrance of osmanthus,

26

the golden autumn has arrived.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,350
To celebrate the annual
Mid-Autumn Festival,

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,350
on the evening of September 27th,

29

at Dajiang Skate Land,

30
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,520
the annual Youth Workers' Fellowship
Grand Party will be held.

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,360
- On this beautiful moonlit night,
- Let's go.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,550
let's come together.

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,310
Everyone is welcome to participate.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
Xiaolu.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,200
What are you hiding?

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Nothing.

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,860
Hey, let me tell you some good news.

38
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,630
The doctor said
I can leave the hospital tomorrow.

39
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,400
Well, I'll tell you some good news too.

40
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,550
Tomorrow, I'll be back to work
at the SLI Bureau.

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,750
Really?

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
Congratulations!

43
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,590
Weren't you unhappy about me
returning to the Bureau?

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,870
Why are you so happy now?

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
I've come around.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
You can do what you enjoy.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,590
That is pretty great.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,550
After getting beaten up,

49
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,800
you've become nicer.

50
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,430
The Mid-Autumn Festival
is around the corner.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,920
How do you plan to celebrate it?

52
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,590
I don't.

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
Why?

54
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,870
Ever since I went to the orphanage,

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,340
I have never celebrated
Mid-Autumn Festival.

=Episode 8=
=It's All the Moon's Fault=

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,080
You've really grown up.

58
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,920
You have become capable enough

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,870
to pick up a fight now.

60
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,430
You are really something.

61
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,240
It's okay. I'll protect you.

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,270
I've only been on a business trip

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,800
for a few days,

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,310
and look at the trouble you've caused.

65
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,590
Mom,

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,870
I know you're worried about me, right?

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
I've told you, it's just a minor injury,

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,400
nothing serious.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,080
- I'm worried about you?
- Don't resist.

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,920
In your dreams!

71
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,710
If I had known
you would fight with someone,

72
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,750
I would have broken your leg.

73
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,150
Hey! What are you doing?

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
What are you doing?

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,360
You can't hit me!

76
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh, who's here?

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,400
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
Hey, why are you here?

79
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,590
I'm here to visit Xiaolu.

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,080
Mr. Lu, I also came to visit Xiaolu.

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,310
You came to visit Xiaolu too?

82
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,270
Xiaolu is at home. Come in, please.

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,840
- Mrs. Lu.
- Come in, please.

84
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,470
- You two are so beautiful.
- Hello, Mrs. Lu.

85
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,710
Hello, hello.

86
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,030
I gave you a warning before you fought,

87
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,590
but you didn't even tell me
you left the hospital.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,470
- I...
- That's right.

89
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,760
I cooked for you in the past few days,

90
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,790
and you didn't tell me either.

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,320
It's not a good thing after all.

92
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,590
I can't let you two
hold a party for me, right?

93
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,230
- We would have done that.
- We would have done that.

94
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,230
These are calcium supplements for you.

95
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,200
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,
these supplements are for you.

96
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,230
Oh, thank you so much.

97
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,150
Oh my, this girl is really considerate.

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,040
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,

99
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,110
supplements are all deceitful.

100
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,020
It's best to rely on food for nutrition.

101
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,670
You see, all-natural.

102
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,000
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Oh, quickly, quickly.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,080
Pick that up.

104
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,750
Over there, over there.

105
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Which one do you like?

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,560
This one is not bad.

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,790
- Take it away!
- This one is also good.

108
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,760
Where is it, where is it?

109
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,000
Give it to me.

110
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,150
They both look good.

111
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,440
- You like both of them?
- Yes.

112
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,300
Come in.

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,220
Mom.

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
Why are you here?

115
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,980
I brought you a little surprise.

116
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,100
I am busy with budgeting.

117
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,460
What is it?

118
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,420
Is the bureau's Mid-Autumn Festival party
under your jurisdiction?

119
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,300
Yes.

120
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,620
Why?

121
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,580
I want to bring a friend.

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,700
She's not from the bureau
or a family member.

123
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,620
Is that okay?

124
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,660
You should ask your dad.

125
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,860
He has more authority than me.

126
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,100
Every time I ask my dad for something,

127
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,380
he always talks about principles.

128
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,420
He would never help me.

129
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,260
Mom,

130
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,780
you also have the power.

131
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,100
You're almost a deputy bureau chief.

132
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,340
You can easily help me.

133
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,780
Your girlfriend?

134
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,940
Well, not quite yet.

135
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,820
Soon, though.

136
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,300
This is a big deal.

137
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,140
Bring her to me,

138
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,620
I'll take a look at her.

139
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,260
Mom, it's too early for that.

140
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,820
You're always so serious,

141
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,940
you might scare her off.

142
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,500
Can you just treat her
like an ordinary friend?

143
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,660
Our family is special, you know.

144
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm a department head,
and your dad is a bureau chief.

145
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,140
If she's not decent enough,

146
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,500
how can we introduce her to anyone?

147
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,700
She is a university graduate,

148
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,740
definitely decent enough.

149
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,460
If you feel embarrassed,

150
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,420
I'll ask Ding Dezhong to handle it.

151
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,340
- But...
- Alright, go back.

152
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,460
Mom,

153
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,780
stop staying at the guesthouse.

154
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,020
You and Dad have been in a cold war
for so long.

155
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,260
You should go home.

156
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,380
Stay out of adult matters.

157
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,780
Oh, my son.

158
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,780
Let me pour you a cup of tea.

159
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,300
Oh Mom, it's fine, I'll pour it myself.

160
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Let me do it for you.

161
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,580
Let me do it.

162
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,740
I'll do it.

163
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,140
Okay, okay.

164
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,300
Let's have a chat.

165
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,580
Mom,

166
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,100
why did you suddenly invite me to dinner

167
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,460
and pour me tea?

168
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
It's pretty scary.

169
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,780
Just tell me

170
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,860
what you want.

171
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,020
What plans are you making?

172
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
Tell Mom.

173
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,580
Who are you planning to invite

174
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,420
to the Mid-Autumn Festival party?

175
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,940
Mom, don't worry about this matter.

176
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,180
Whatever.

177
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,940
I know who

178
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,260
you will invite anyway.

179
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,220
Who is it?

180
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,340
You think you can keep

181
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,540
your little thoughts from me?

182
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,140
I not only know

183
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,820
who you want to go with,

184
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,860
but I also know

185
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,900
you've liked her for a long time.

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,380
You're just one step away from dating,

187
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,740
aren't you?

188
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,300
Mom,

189
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,700
who's been telling you these things?

190
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,060
Listen to Mom, okay?

191
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,500
You and her,

192
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,420
even though one is a worker

193
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,380
and the other

194
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,860
is like a junior cadre,

195
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,220
as long as you two are in love,

196
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,380
you will get my blessing.

197
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,740
Really.

198
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,500
But...

199
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,500
I don't even know

200
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,340
if she likes me.

201
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,060
Of course she likes you.

202
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,620
You're my son!

203
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,620
You're my son.

204
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,260
Your dad and I are experienced.

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,980
Just by looking at

206
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,740
these things,

207
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,300
we can tell what's going on.

208
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,020
Really?

209
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,940
Of course.

210
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,460
If she didn't like you,

211
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,700
why would she agree to come?

212
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,340
Come here?

213
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,300
She agreed to come!

214
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,020
This way.

215
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Director Ding,

216
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
why the secrecy

217
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,980
over a work dinner?

218
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,620
Anyway, you'll benefit from it.

219
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
It's a great thing.

220
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,060
Who is it exactly?

221
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,620
Why not just go in and find out?

222
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,180
Come on.

223
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Let me tell you,

224
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,140
I...

225
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,140
Juan!

226
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,020
You are finally here.

227
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,260
Come here, sit down.

228
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Let me tell you something.

229
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,540
Guess what?

230
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
Yesterday,

231
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,260
I ran into your Aunt Dong.

232
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,460
If it weren't for

233
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,260
Aunt Dong telling me,

234
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,820
I would still be in the dark.

235
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,860
Hey, Mom,

236
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,780
what did she tell you?

237
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,900
Aunt Dong said that

238
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,660
Juan often goes to your dorm

239
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
to find you.

240
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,900
One time, she even went
in the middle of the night.

241
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,620
Is that true?

242
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah, she did come. So what?

243
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,380
As young people,

244
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,860
you should express your love boldly.

245
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,060
Is that right, Juan?

246
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,820
Juan, which year were you born in?

247
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,020
I was born in '77.

248
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,220
Oh, really?

249
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,420
Xiaolu was also born in '77.

250
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,060
So, you're both born
in the year of the snake.

251
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,820
What should I call you two?

252
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,300
Golden snakes!

253
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,900
Golden snakes.

254
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,380
More like rotten snakes

255
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,860
- or crazy snakes.
- What are you saying?

256
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,020
How old are you this year?

257
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,820
23,

258
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,820
about the same age as Zhigang.

259
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,030
I heard you're a university graduate.

260
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
That's right.

261
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,380
We only have a few university graduates

262
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,260
in our factory.

263
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,820
She must have been a model student
since childhood.

264
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,540
Ma'am, you misunderstood.

265
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,140
I was not a good student

266
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,660
since childhood.

267
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,660
Look,

268
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,540
young girls nowadays are modest.

269
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,620
I'm a university graduate,

270
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,330
but I only got a graduation certificate,

271
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,500
not a degree certificate.

272
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,220
What do you mean?

273
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,940
Before graduation, I was dissatisfied with
the school's unfair distribution

274
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,060
and clashed with the leadership.

275
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
An accident happened.

276
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,060
What kind of accident?

277
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,100
I hit the principal's head

278
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,860
and ended up

279
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,860
in jail because of that.

280
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,900
Do you want to know more?

281
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,260
I'll tell you everything.

282
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,580
If I remember correctly,

283
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,740
you and Xiaolu were

284
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,260
middle school classmates, right?

285
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,620
Yes.

286
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,060
Good.

287
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,420
You know each other well.

288
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,780
Don't take what he said to heart.

289
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,540
He's been mischievous since childhood

290
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,740
and has a bad mouth.

291
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,940
- And he doesn't know
- Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

292
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,420
how to express love.

293
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,340
He doesn't even know

294
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,980
how to invite a girl to dance with him.

295
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,780
I can do that.

296
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,540
You can do what?

297
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,220
I can be your Mid-Autumn Festival
dance partner.

298
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,720
Come on.

299
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,980
Good.

300
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,140
Why are you making that face?

301
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,740
Are you happy or upset?

302
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,980
Mom,

303
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,460
I have to clarify something today.

304
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,180
Little Pouter did come to our dorm,

305
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,940
but I don't think it was for me.

306
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,500
The person who really wanted to invite her

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,390
as a dance partner wasn't me,

308
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,420
it was Li Guangnan.

309
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,220
And

310
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,620
there is someone I want to invite.

311
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,100
- But that girl is...
- I don't want to know.

312
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,980
Stop talking.

313
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,820
Hey, Juan!

314
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
Juan!

315
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,500
Why did you say such things

316
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,660
in front of her?

317
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,940
Mom, what did I say?

318
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,580
You're also colleagues.

319
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,180
You shouldn't hurt her like that.

320
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,480
What are you still standing there for?

321
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,660
Go find her

322
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,940
and apologize to her.

323
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,660
Oh no,

324
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,180
I've made a mistake

325
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,900
and caused trouble.

326
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,540
But now Bai Lan has changed.

327
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,660
She's not so impulsive anymore.

328
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,540
Since she came to our factory,

329
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,700
she excels in all aspects,

330
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,860
which is why

331
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,900
she caught a young talent

332
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,620
like Zhigang's attention.

333
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,940
Exactly,

334
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
Bai Lan is doing

335
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,900
very well in the factory.

336
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
- Am I right?
- Yes.

337
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,940
Director Ding,

338
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,900
Secretary Bi,

339
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,100
are you serious?

340
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,420
Have you forgotten why I was

341
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,740
sent to the boiler room?

342
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,020
Bai Lan, stop talking nonsense.

343
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,860
Let her speak.

344
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,980
Ma'am,

345
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,300
there's a situation
you may not understand.

346
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,100
I provided a fake mental illness certificate

347
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,780
for our female worker, Afang.

348
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
That's why I was punished
and sent to the boiler room.

349
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,620
- You...
- Why did you issue

350
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,140
a fake mental illness certificate?

351
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,540
Well,

352
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,940
on Secretary Bi's instructions.

353
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
- I...
- Because if I hadn't done it,

354
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,620
Afang's public accusation

355
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,940
in front of the whole factory

356
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,620
that Director Ding mistreated her

357
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,260
would be believed by all.

358
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,820
Our family in Fucheng

359
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,420
is respected.

360
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,860
How could someone with bad manners,

361
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,100
low education,

362
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,900
bad character,

363
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,980
and a stained past

364
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,660
be worthy of my son?

365
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,100
Mom,

366
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,620
although Bai Lan made mistakes before,

367
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,300
she's doing well now.

368
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,500
Admitting fault and changing

369
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,490
for the better is commendable.

370
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,540
Mom...

371
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,740
What right do you have

372
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,780
to criticize Bai Lan?

373
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,500
Lu Xiaolu, what are you doing here?

374
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,980
You...

375
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,780
What you call a stained past

376
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,620
is standing up for the weak

377
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
and upholding justice.

378
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,580
Is that a stain on life?

379
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,140
It's a shining moment!

380
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,620
People like you with narrow-minded views

381
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,820
will never understand.

382
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,820
What are you talking about?

383
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,860
Do you know who you are talking to?

384
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,420
I'll say that no matter who is here!

385
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,660
What an arrogant young man.

386
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,820
Who are you?

387
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,060
Where are you from?

388
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm Lu Xiaolu,

389
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,940
Bai Lan's boyfriend.

390
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,860
Lu Xiaolu,

391
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
are you crazy?

392
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,500
Bai Lan doesn't have a boyfriend.

393
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,820
Is he your boyfriend?

394
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,740
No.

395
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,540
Mom, Mom.

396
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,620
He's just a troublemaker in the factory,

397
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,580
a filthy rascal.

398
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,580
He thinks he's the boyfriend
of every girl!

399
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,660
Are you out of your mind?

400
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,980
Why are you glaring at me?

401
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,580
It looks like you are not welcome here.

402
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,060
Please leave.

403
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,820
This is a family gathering.

404
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,140
Get out now.

405
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,220
Get out!

406
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,220
Although Lu Xiaolu isn't my boyfriend,

407
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,060
he's my best friend.

408
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,030
We are the same kind of people.

409
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,300
He's a rascal, and I'm a female rascal.

410
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,700
We'll leave together.

411
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,060
Let's go.

412
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,020
Hey, Bai Lan.

413
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,100
Bai Lan!

414
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,300
You two, stop.

415
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,740
Sit down.

416
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,460
Oh, Mrs. Ding,

417
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,220
look what's happened.

418
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,140
This is...

419
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,340
It's fine.

420
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,140
Let's eat.

421
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,660
Let's eat. Let's eat.

422
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,500
Come on.

423
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,500
Eat.

424
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,400
The people from the Bi family
are so snobbish.

425
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,620
Who are they

426
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,780
to talk about you like that?

427
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,900
So, taking a bottle of wine from them

428
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,020
isn't excessive.

429
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,540
We can share it.

430
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,020
Not bad.

431
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,500
You are drinking too much.

432
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,380
Bai Lan, let me ask you.

433
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,020
Why didn't you admit earlier

434
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
that I'm your boyfriend?

435
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
What about that night

436
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,140
when we got drunk?

437
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,420
What was that all about?

438
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,500
Do I mean

439
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,580
absolutely nothing to you?

440
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,180
You are still thinking about that night?

441
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,940
That night...

442
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,900
That night I drank too much,

443
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,780
so I accidentally kissed you.

444
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,820
I apologize to you.

445
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,820
What do you mean you apologize to me?

446
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,460
Do I need your apology?

447
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,060
That night,

448
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,500
you not only kissed me.

449
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,860
We also...

450
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,660
The finger-guessing game?

451
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,340
We...

452
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,340
Don't tell me you think we did that.

453
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,580
Hey, why are you laughing?

454
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,660
Because you are so silly.

455
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,340
How am I silly?

456
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,740
Two buddies!

457
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,140
Three stars!

458
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,500
Four fortunes!

459
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,020
Five champions!

460
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,580
Six successes!

461
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,980
Seven surprises!

462
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,460
Eight immortals!

463
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,900
Nine rings!

464
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,700
Ten... Ten...

465
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,940
Ten...

466
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,340
Bai Lan.

467
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,180
Bai Lan.

468
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,700
Bai...

469
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,260
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

470
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,180
How did I suddenly become...

471
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,380
Become...

472
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,700
Become what?

473
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,740
Become...

474
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,380
Become...

475
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,500
I just feel...

476
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,940
I just feel so sad inside.

477
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,860
Stop whining.

478
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,660
You are luckier than me.

479
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,420
At least that kiss of yours

480
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,660
is real.

481
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I have been liking Little Pouter
for so many years,

482
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,740
but I haven't even...

483
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
I...

484
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,220
I haven't even touched

485
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,580
the tips of her fingers.

486
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,620
What right do you have

487
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,660
to criticize Bai Lan?

488
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,140

You still have a bit of conscience!

542
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,860
Do you know how many people
I have turned down

543
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,060
just to wait for his confession?

544
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,020
Actually...

545
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,020
Thank you, Big Feet.

546
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,740

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm so happy!

My dad says

551
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,780
I've never had any artistic talent
since I was a child.

552
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,300
What if I embarrass myself

553
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,380
in front of him at the dance tomorrow?

554
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,820
It's okay, I'll teach you.

555
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,780

Still thinking about Dr. Bai?

563
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,580
Just thinking about it won't do any good.

564
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,420
If you like her,

565
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,660
invite her to dance.

566
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,580
I did invite her.

567
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,100
But she's not coming.

568
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,340
How many times did you invite her?

569
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,460
Don't tell me you gave up

570
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,480
just after being rejected once.

571
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Once is already enough.

572
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,500
I care about my dignity, you know.

573
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,920
Do you think I'm someone
who cares about dignity?

574
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,380
Of course. You care about
your dignity the most.

575
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,140
Then let me tell you,

576
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,220
I'm willing to give up

577
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,660
all dignity

578
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,500
for the girl I like.

579
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,260
That's a man's true nature.

580
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,460
It's not embarrassing at all.

581
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,980
Love

582
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,570
is something you have to
fight for yourself.

583
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,500
You need to be brave.

584
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,700
Don't be like me,

585
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,620
regretting not doing

586
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,860
what I should have done

587
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,660
so I'm still single.

588
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,580
Alright,

589
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,620
hurry up and come in.

590
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,340
Sorry for calling you out

591
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,380
so late tonight.

592
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,780
But this party tonight

593
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
is organized by the city.

594
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,740
People from all walks of life in Fucheng

595
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,600
and many foreigners are attending.

596
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,780
Don't worry,
I'll be with you the whole time.

597
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,740
Bai Lan,

598
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,980
are you still mad about that dinner

599
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
that night?

600
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,820
Secretary Bi,

601
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,420
I hope there won't be any more

602
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,780
private dinners like that in the future,

603
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,660
especially without my knowledge.

604
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,620
It's all my mom's fault.
She's too impatient.

605
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,140
I told her not to do that.

606
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,580
Don't take what she said to heart.

607
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,700
You know that's not what I meant.

608
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
Also,

609
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,700
could you please stop trying

610
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,300
to irritate me with Lu Xiaolu?

611
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,860
I know

612
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,740
you can't really like him.

613
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,900
After all, with your status,

614
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
you are way out of his league.

615
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,980
Actually, I don't mind

616
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,020
if you two become friends.

617
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,300
After all, being friends

618
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,740
doesn't mean being together.

619
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,860
And,

620
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,500
when you try to use him to irritate me,

621
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,180
I actually feel a little sweet inside.

622
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,180
Because that means

623
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,100
you at least

624
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,220
care about me.

625
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,580
That's the only reason you do it.

626
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,860
Am I right?

627
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,700
Can we talk about work?

628
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,820
Alright,

629
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,980
let's talk about work.

630
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,140
What's wrong?

631
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,020
Do I look weird?

632
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,020
This is for me?

633
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Are you wearing your dad's suit?

634
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,580
No.

635
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,380
I love you.

636
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,460
Do I look like Leon Lai Ming?

637
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,380
Did you put pig fat on your hair?

638
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,460
No.

639
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,820
Don't forget your task today.

640
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,340
Don't worry.

641
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,980
I won't let you lose face.

642
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,220
(Skate Land
Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration)

643
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

644
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,100
are you ready?

645
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,900
I declare...

646
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,580
I declare...

647
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
I declare...

648
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,980
The 1996...

649
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,580
Dajiang.

650
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,580
Dajiang?

651
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,220
The 1996

652
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,900
Golden Peacock Mid-Autumn Festival
dance party

653
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,060
begins now!

654
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
Why can you do this?

655
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,640
I learned it at the Youth Palace
when I was a child.

656
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,580
Not bad, right?

657
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,060
Together!

658
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,300
Cool!

659
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,180
I have great confidence
in the future of Fucheng.

660
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,580
But currently, your infrastructure

661
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,100
is not enough.

662
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,420
You should spend more effort on it.

663
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,500
He has a lot of confidence

664
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,580
in Fucheng's future,

665
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,660
but currently our infrastructure

666
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,820
isn't sufficient.

667
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,060
He thinks
we should spend more effort on it.

668
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,900
He's absolutely right.

669
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,180
Tell him that

670
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,380
this has indeed

671
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,220
been the focus of the city's work
in recent years.

672
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Mr. Bi totally agrees with you.

673
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,820
And he said the infrastructure has been

674
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,140
the main focus by the city these years.

675
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Very well, Mr. Bi.

676
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,220
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

677
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,260
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

678
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,940
My father.

679
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,820
Nice to meet you and your son.

680
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,700
You've been waiting, huh?

681
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,300
I saw the note.

682
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,500
You usually act so serious,

683
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,280
I never expected you could write that.

684
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,260
What note?

685
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,860
Oh, come on.

686
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
I'll wait for you over there.

687
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,340
Xiaolu.

688
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,460
Xiaolu.

689
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,980
- Hey, Debao.
- What are you thinking about?

690
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,340
The prizes are out.

691
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,300
First prize is

692
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,020
a year pass for the Dajiang Skate Land,

693
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,060
second prize is

694
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,380
a box of exquisite five-nut mooncakes,

695
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,580
and third prize is a box of animal crackers.

696
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,860
That's it?

697
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,180
Music!

698
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,500
Xiaolu, see you later!

699
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,900
Have you ever had animal crackers?

700
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,380
Animal crackers?

701
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,260
Yeah,

702
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,820
when I was at the orphanage,

703
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,780
if we behaved well,

704
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,260
the teachers would give us

705
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,580
animal crackers.

706
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,940
There were tigers,

707
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,660
elephants,

708
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,300
monkeys,

709
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,300
all sorts of them.

710
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,980
Those kids favored by the teachers

711
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,500
had countless animal crackers,

712
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,340
but I never got a single one.

713
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,460
Later, I got so anxious that

714
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,180
I said to them,

715
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,340
"Let's play a game together.

716
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,060
If you lose,

717
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,400
you have to give me the crackers."

718
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,380
And then?

719
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,300
Of course I won,

720
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,060
but they just refused

721
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,820
to give them to me.

722
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,460
So you know what I did?

723
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,980
What did you do?

724
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
I beat them up

725
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,580
one by one

726
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,020
and took all their crackers.

727
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,500
But then I realized

728
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,060
the animals were all gone because

729
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,260
all the crackers were broken into pieces.

730
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
Interesting story, huh?

731
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,860
Dajiang.

732
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,780
Where did you just go?

733
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,020
I went to the bathroom.

734
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,620
Can I borrow this?

735
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,900
Take it.

736
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,300
Thank you.

737
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,220
I'll be right back.

738
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
I won't close

739
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,940
before you take her here.

740
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,860
Alright.

741
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,660
Xiaolu!

742
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,340
Why are you leaving?

743
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,260
Why don't you dance with me?

744
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,860
Just go have fun.

745
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,660
Go on, go on.

746
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,100
Thanks!

747
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,060
You're welcome.

748
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,100
I didn't expect you

749
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,140
to dance pretty well.

750
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,620
Thank you.

751
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,860
Oh, by the way,

752
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,220
in addition to the dance

753
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,260
I just did today,

754
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,900
I also know the cowboy dance.

755
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,820
And recently, I've been learning

756
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,140
the tap dance.

757
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,580
When we were in school,
I didn't know anything.

758
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,340
Only you were willing
to help me on stage.

759
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,980
Now I'm better, right?

760
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,820
I've made progress.

761
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,260
By the way,

762
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,620
thank you, Li Guangnan.

763
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,220
Thank you

764
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,900
for helping me shine

765
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,540
in front of Lu Xiaolu.

766
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,420
But I know,

767
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,060
if someone doesn't like you,

768
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,500
no matter how pretty you dress

769
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,220
or how well you dance,

770
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,380
they'll still like someone else.

771
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,060
Even if Lu Xiaolu doesn't like you,

772
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,180
you're still you.

773
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,060
There will be someone else
in this world who likes you,

774
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,980
just like me.

775
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,720
I still remember

776
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,940
when I first saw you

777
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,260
in junior high,

778
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,540
I thought, "My goodness,

779
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,620
how can there be such a beautiful girl
in this world?"

780
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
At that moment, I made a vow.

781
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,580
I said, "Someday, I will

782
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,180
make this girl my girlfriend."

783
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,780
Little Pouter,

784
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,300
will you be my girlfriend?

785
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,540
Li Guangnan,

786
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,340
I will never like you.

787
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,900
I,

788
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,020
Qin Juan,

789
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,180
have always been one of the top students

790
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,900
in my class since I was a child.

791
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,420
Even in the factory, I am a cadre.

792
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,820
The person I like
should be the most handsome

793
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,110
and dazzling in the crowd.

794
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,780
And what about you?

795
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,580
When I was kicked out of my house,

796
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,260
did you have a place to take me in?

797
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,020
Why do you think you can like me?

798
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,940
I need a home.

799
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,980
I want to have a house.

800
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,700
Can you give me that?

801
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,700
You're being vain.

802
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,660
I am!

803
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,780
I actually liked you! I'm such a fool!

804
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,940
Then don't like me.

805
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,580
Guangnan,

806
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,820
that bottle can be exchanged for money.

807
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,780
I have plenty of money.

808
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,900
Okay.

809
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,580
Tired?

810
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,420
What do you think

811
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,420
about this wine party?

812
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,860
It's not an exaggeration to say

813
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,140
it's the highest standard
in the whole city, right?

814
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,780
Bai Lan,

815
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
you have the opportunity

816
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,940
to meet the highest level of people
in Fucheng here.

817
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,820
You also

818
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,300
have the chance to become one of them.

819
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,740
Secretary Bi,

820
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,100
I'm just a small translator,

821
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,780
I can't reach that level.

822
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,780
Bai Lan,

823
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,260
I know

824
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,100
you have opinions about me,

825
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,420
but I don't mind.

826
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,540
I don't mind being rejected by you
again and again,

827
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,620
and I don't mind

828
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,740
you always give me a bad face.

829
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,340
Because I know

830
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,740
you would never be content

831
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,460
with a low worker like

832
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,300
Lu Xiaolu.

833
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,180
I believe...

834
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,140
I don't look down
on the working class by the way.

835
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,860
I just think

836
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,820
you and he are so different.

837
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,540
You have talent, beauty,

838
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,540
ambition,

839
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,350
and there are things

840
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,660
that only I, Bi Zhigang, can give you.

841
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,660
What about him?

842
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,460
What can he give you?

843
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,660
A modified bicycle?

844
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,260
Speaking of which, it's funny.

845
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,220
Do you remember last time we fought?

846
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,580
He actually came to me in advance,

847
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,900
wanting to make a bet.

848
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,420
If I agree to this matter,

849
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,580
you will admit defeat?

850
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,940
I keep my word.

851
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,170
The situation has already escalated.

852
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,340
You admit defeat?

853
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,540
Can your maintenance team agree to that?

854
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,900
Admit defeat without a fight,

855
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,580
how boring.

856
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,180
If this gets out,

857
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,540
others will think I, Bi Zhigang,

858
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,940
am a sore winner.

859
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,100
What do you want then?

860
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,660
If I win,

861
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,500
let Bai Lan leave the boiler room

862
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,180
and return to the SLI Bureau.

863
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,260
If you win?

864
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,540
Bai Lan can return to the SLI Bureau,

865
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,660
but you

866
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,500
have to lose.

867
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,020
That idiot,

868
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,500
he knew that even if I...

869
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,140
- I would definitely...
- Bi Zhigang!

870
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,420
You rat!

871
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,180
I have said it many times,

872
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,700
you can't enter without an invitation.

873
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,140
Alright, I won't go in.

874
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,500
Can you at least help me call someone?

875
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,180
You can't go in.

876
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,620
Go, go, just leave.

877
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,500
Director Bi's son, Bi Zhigang,
you know him, right?

878
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,820
I'm looking for a tall girl.

879
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,020
She should be around him.

880
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,860
Could you take a look for me?

881
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,820
- Xiaolu.
- Bai Lan.

882
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,700
What are you doing here?

883
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,460
- I...
- Stop talking. Come with me.

884
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,580
Bai Lan, you...

885
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,820
You...

886
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,980
You will regret this.

887
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,860
Look at her.

888
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,820
She's going to step on his feet.

889
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,180
It's okay, it's okay.

890
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,020
There it goes.

891
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,380
And this guy dares to dance with her?

892
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,860
I've been observing all night.

893
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,060
Let me tell you...

894
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,660
Look, look.

895
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,100
This girl is the queen of stepping on feet.

896
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,100
She's stepped on over 20 people tonight.

897
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,180
Over 20?

898
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,020
No wonder no one

899
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,780
danced a complete song with her.

900
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,100
Forget it, let's go.

901
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,060
Alright, let's go.

902
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,940
Go on.

903
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,260
Forget it, Dajiang.

904
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,300
What are you afraid of?

905
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,500
Next,

906
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,740
the last performance of the evening.

907
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,740
No, no, I can't do it.

908
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,580
Dajiang.

909
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,700
Xiaoying.

910
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,580
Music!

911
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,180
One, two, three!

912
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,860
Bravo!

913
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,060
I can dance now.

914
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,500
Why were you at the wine party?

915
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,260
I...

916
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,700
I just happened to pass by.

917
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,020
You're lying.

918
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,460
I'm not lying.

919
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,860
You are lying.

920
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,980
And you said
you couldn't beat Bi Zhigang.

921
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,700
You intentionally lost to him

922
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,420
to make me return
to the SLI Bureau, right?

923
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,580
I really didn't.

924
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,020
I just couldn't beat him.

925
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,860
Alright, spill it.

926
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,260
What else did you lie about?

927
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,100
I lied about a lot of things.

928
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,180
Which one do you want to hear?

929
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,660
Then start from just now.

930
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,140
Just now?

931
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,460
When I said I just happened

932
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,540
to pass by the wine party?

933
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,260
I admit I lied.

934
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,300
I was angry and anxious.

935
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,740
I saw you in Bi Zhigang's car.

936
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,180
I didn't know where you went.

937
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,860
I asked many people and finally
found that place.

938
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,820
But the security at the door

939
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,660
didn't let me in.

940
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,460
Said I didn't have an invitation.

941
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,260
I could only wait at the entrance,
waiting and waiting.

942
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,700
Finally you came out.

943
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,140
Yes,

944
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,060
I know it's too late now
for anything I say.

945
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,340
But I still want to try one last time.

946
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,740
Can I invite you to dance?

947
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,740
You...

948
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,860
Are you okay?

949
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,620
It's not too late.

950
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,540
Not too late?

951
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,020
Let's go, to the skating rink.

952
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:38,260
(Skate Land)

953
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,900
Do you remember when I said

954
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,300
I never celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival?

955
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,740
Today is my first time.

956
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,500
I will never forget your words.

957
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,220
From now on,
every Mid-Autumn Festival,

958
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,020
I will be with you.

959
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,460
You're not alone anymore.

960
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,300
You have me,

961
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,660
and friends.

962
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,920
And in the future, you'll have a family,

963
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,180
with many children.

964
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,700
I hope that

965
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,460
when we grow old,

966
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,340
you'll still remember today.

967
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,620
That there was someone named Lu Xiaolu

968
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,100
who spent your first
Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

969
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,620
Can I invite you to dance?

970
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,900
