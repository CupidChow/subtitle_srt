(Shanghai)

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,290
Why didn't you let me know

26
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,450
before heading to Fucheng
straight from Lhasa?

27
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,550
Mr. Huang,

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,830
for these past few years,

29
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,820
almost every weekend
I've been working overtime.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
This is the first time,

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,490
do I need to report to you?

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,490
Wanna file a complaint?

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,660
Went back to see an old friend?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Yes,

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,500
an old friend got married.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,100
Hello, Mr. Chen.

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,990
Yes.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,360
The contract for Mulan Winery

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,050
is about to get ready.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,630
It should be sent to you

41
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,610
within about a week.

42
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,660
Alright, don't worry.

43
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,870
When you come to Shanghai,

44
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,230
I'll personally take you
to tour the Bund.

45
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,770
Alright, thank you.

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,750
Goodbye.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,230
I heard you've submitted
an application again

48
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,990
to the subsidiary
for the general manager position.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Yeah,

50
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,260
the first year the board
said I was too young.

51
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,520
The second year,

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,170
they said they needed to

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,290
prioritize senior veterans.

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,630
This year, I've secured

55
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,010
three major projects for the company.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,380
Let's see what excuse
they have to reject me this time.

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,940
You want to leave my side that bad?

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,330
I've been an executive assistant

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,290
for too long.

60
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,270
Moreover,

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,050
when I become the manager,

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,700
I can help you earn more money.

63
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,100
Are you hungry?

64
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,450
Let me take you to eat something.

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
Forget it.

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,830
I'll just go back to the company
and have boxed lunch.

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,190
I heard the competition

68
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,320
for the Lhasa project is fierce.

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,580
I want to strike while the iron is hot.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Good,

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,850
looks like you'll get it for sure.

72
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,510
I've been on this project for three years

73
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,850
and waited for three years.

74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,980
When I become the general manager,

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,940
then you can celebrate my success.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,840
What do you think?

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,450
Fucheng has changed a lot

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,970
in the past two years, right?

79
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,030
Dajiang,

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,960
you know what?

81
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,530
People's Park has been demolished.

82
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,450
(Fucheng)

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,800
Now, a commercialized residential area

84
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,650
has been built there.

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,890
Many wealthy people
have bought houses there.

86
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,380
So where is the park now?

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,940
It moved to the west.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,790
Fucheng First High School
and People's Hospital

89
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,860
are also going to move there soon.

90
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,740
In recent years,

91
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,890
real estate in Fucheng
has developed rapidly.

92
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,230
In the future, that area

93
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,300
will be called the High-Tech Zone.

94
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,550
They say many high-tech companies

95
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,740
will be introduced there.

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,880
Dajiang,

97
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,300
are you going to

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,570
leave again?

99
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm not young anymore.
Time to settle down.

100
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,210
Your mom...

101
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,820
Did she feel disappointed in me
before she passed away?

102
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,530
How could she?

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,640
If she knew you were performing well

104
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,480
and released early,

105
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,860
she'd be delighted.

106
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,350
However, these past two years,

107
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,650
you've been drifting alone outside.

108
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,180
She must be worrying.

109
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,160
Let's not talk about it.

110
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
It's all in the past.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,090
You know what?

112
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
The guys knew you were coming back today

113
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,800
and are all excited.

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Let's go to Ms. Tao's hotel for a meal later.

115
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,970
Everyone wants to welcome you.

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,450
Dajiang, you get off here.

117
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
I'll go park the car.

118
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,460

=The One You Miss but Are Afraid to Meet=

120
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,700
Does he not want to see me?

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,410
Wait for me here.

122
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,470
I'll go find him.

123
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,400
If you're not ready

124
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
to meet them today,

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,740
you can choose not to.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,160
I need to go
to the neighborhood committee.

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe another day.

128
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
And after that?

129
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,670
I'll go home.

130
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
Okay.

131
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,530
I've tidied up the house for you.

132
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,450
You don't need to accompany me.

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,330
I can live alone without any problems.

134
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,500
Who wants to accompany you?

135
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,280
I just like your houseboat.

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,380
I'm used to living there.

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,630
What?

138
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,940
Are you trying to kick me out?

139
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,530
You rascal.

140
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,620
If you're willing to accompany me,

141
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,940
I'm happy.

142
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,700
Dajiang,

143
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,660
let's go home.

144
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,700
Let's go.

145
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,140
Dajiang, what are you watching?

146
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,900
Back when we watched
Young and Dangerous,

147
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,660
they fought with real blades and guns.

148
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Now, a flash of light

149
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,220
and the world collapses.

150
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,520
I don't understand this at all.

151
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,420
Dajiang,

152
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,020
that's just the trend.

153
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,340
Nowadays,
young people love watching this.

154
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,460
Come on.

155
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,020
Welcome home.

156
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,500
How are our old brothers doing?

157
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,980
Which one are you asking about?

158
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,740
Haonan or Shanji?

159
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,820
Tell me about both.

160
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,140
Brother Haonan

161
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,660
lost a hand

162
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,600
and went back to his hometown.

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,140
Brother Shanji is doing business
and became a boss.

164
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,260
Who did Haonan end up with?

165
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,260
How would I know that?

166
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,140
Probably living alone.

167
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,460
What?

168
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,260
Can't I sit with you?

169
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,940
Dajiang,

170
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,460
how about this?

171
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,860
Come to my company.

172
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,820
Let's work together.

173
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,660
No need.

174
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,020
The neighborhood committee
introduced me to a job.

175
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,100
As for business matters,

176
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,560
I've long stopped thinking about them.

177
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,420
Dajiang,

178
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,460
as long as you're willing to join,

179
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,620
my company
will always have a place for you.

180
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,660
You brat,

181
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,100
you're handling everything for me now?

182
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,180
How have you been recently?

183
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,820
Still cooking for yourself all the time?

184
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,340
Not really.

185
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,500
I cook when I have time.

186
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,860
Usually, work keeps me busy,

187
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,020
so I just eat whatever.

188
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,100
Why don't you have a woman by your side?

189
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,980
Right now, I just want to make money.

190
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,740
I'm not interested in women.

191
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,140
You're handsome and wealthy.

192
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,700
How can you not
have girls chasing after you?

193
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,100
Back when you were running
the ice skating rink,

194
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,860
weren't you handsome and rich?

195
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,620
How come there was no woman around you?

196
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,740
I did have a woman.

197
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,180
She was just not by my side.

198
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,540
She was in my heart.

199
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,900
Then why don't you hurry up and meet her?

200
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,940
You don't have someone

201
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,700
you want to see but are afraid to see?

202
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,660
Are you still thinking about Dr. Bai?

203
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,580
Come on.

204
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
Manager Bai!

205
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,820
Manager Bai!

206
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,340
What's the reason this time
for not choosing me?

207
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,300
This was the board's decision.

208
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,580
Is it really the board's decision

209
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,420
or just because she's the daughter
of a company director?

210
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,740
Actually,

211
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,940
it's not like what you think.

212
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,580
She studied finance in Switzerland

213
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,540
and interned at the head office for a year.

214
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
What about her project experience?

215
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,580
Last year, you used that as a reason

216
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,420
to reject me.

217
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,900
So, no matter how many projects I do

218
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,100
or how much money I make for you,

219
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,060
I still can't reach where I want to be.

220
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,380
This is the third time already.

221
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,540
Why can others,

222
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,500
but not me?

223
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,500
Every time, there's always some reason.

224
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Can't there be at least one instance
solely based on merit?

225
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,780
Have you ever thought that

226
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,260
it's because I value you

227
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,380
that I've kept you by my side?

228
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,140
Alright,

229
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
instead of being a general manager,

230
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,700
I have a more important task for you.

231
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,380
How do you see me?

232
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,500
As a gunman?

233
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,620
Your vanguard?

234
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,140
Or just a pawn you can command?

235
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,540
Have you forgotten how you convinced me

236
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,500
to give you a job and how you fought hard

237
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,180
to prove yourself
when you were desperate?

238
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,300
The choice you're making now

239
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,220
comes at a high cost.

240
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,420
As you can see,

241
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,660
I'm at my wit's end.

242
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,460
I need a job opportunity.

243
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,620
Why should I help someone

244
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,660
who forced herself into a corner?

245
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,420
But this isn't the endgame.

246
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,740
In a game of chess, the final piece,

247
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
although seemingly

248
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,660
without hope of survival,

249
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,860
isn't a lost cause.

250
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,260
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

251
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,580
it can unleash its greatest vitality.

252
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,460
Over these years,

253
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,580
you've risen from the lowest level intern

254
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,740
to where you are now.

255
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,900
Are you going to give it all up

256
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,900
and return to square one?

257
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,940
I'm sorry,

258
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,540
this is not the Bai Lan I know.

259
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,140
Last month,

260
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,940
I talked over the phone with Mr. Mancini

261
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,980
from Italy.

262
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,020
He owns a very high-quality

263
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,980
chocolate business in Italy.

264
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,340
I plan to control a domestic food company

265
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,300
and transform it into

266
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,700
an Italian brand OEM factory.

267
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,700
In the future,

268
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Italians will provide technical support

269
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,140
and help open up European sales channels.

270
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,860
Currently,

271
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,100
we have data
on three purchasable companies.

272
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,140
As for how to choose,

273
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,420
advice.

274
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,340
I vote for Suzhou.

275
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,180
Firstly, it's an old brand,

276
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,460
and the local government's
support policies

277
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,700
are quite favorable.

278
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,900
But I think this company in Guangzhou

279
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,180
has better transportation

280
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,860
and close business ties

281
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,620
with the Hong Kong headquarters.

282
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,340
I'm also supportive
of this Guangzhou company.

283
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,620
If it were me,

284
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
I would choose Golden Peacock

285
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,820
Food Factory in Fucheng.

286
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,340
I remember
on my first day at the company,

287
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,420
you told me that

288
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,780
the most important factor
for investing in a company successfully

289
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,500
is to have eyes to find undervalued areas.

290
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,100
Many markets in Guangdong cities

291
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,460
have already developed very well,

292
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,460
which obviously doesn't meet our needs.

293
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,100
I just visited Fucheng,

294
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,860
and although the local development

295
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,200
is not as good as Guangzhou and Shenzhen,

296
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,380
this gives us a chance

297
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,620
to seize the market.

298
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,500
Moreover, the local land
and sea transportation

299
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,780
is very convenient.

300
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,460
So from the perspective
of return on investment,

301
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,500
it's very high.

302
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,780
You've worked at this food factory

303
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,660
before coming to Shanghai, right?

304
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,740
Yes,

305
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,300
the workers there
have high technical skills,

306
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,410
and the equipment in the factory
is comprehensive.

307
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,580
Most importantly,

308
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
the factory is currently

309
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,580
at a low point,

310
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,860
having undergone several reforms

311
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,900
without success.

312
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,860
So if we

313
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,100
make a move now,

314
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,540
we can acquire it

315
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,100
at a very good price.

316
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,460
I still think

317
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,580
Guangzhou is more convincing

318
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,780
for the Italians.

319
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,820
And I think the development prospects

320
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,300
in Fucheng are still uncertain.

321
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,700
Isn't your plan a bit too risky?

322
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,060
How big is this

323
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
Golden Peacock Food Factory?

324
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,940
It's over 13 hectares,

325
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,660
and Fucheng has beautiful scenery.

326
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,900
Why not give it a try?

327
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,740
Perhaps the Italians will like it.

328
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,140
Thank you, guys.

329
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,340
- I'll treat everyone to ice cream later.
- Okay.

330
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,540
♪Mission is ready♪

331
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,380
Mr. Li,

332
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,620
how much are these two trucks
of ice cream worth?

333
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,390
Probably tens of thousands of yuan.

334
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,940
Tens of thousands?

335
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,620
That's nothing.

336
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,220
There will be ten more trucks
coming in this afternoon.

337
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,020
Director Li, it's been especially hot
this summer.

338
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,540
If you sell dozens of trucks of ice cream,

339
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,100
I bet you can afford a sea-view house.

340
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,260
Given the high rent

341
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,820
we pay for this cold storage,

342
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,160
of course we should use it to the fullest.

343
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,300
I understand now.

344
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,700
You're becoming
the richest in our Fucheng.

345
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,580
Don't say that.

346
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,420
Thank you.

347
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,340
It's okay.

348
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,580
What is it?

349
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,860
Lately, there have been

350
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,980
some rumors
that aren't very favorable to you.

351
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,740
What rumors?

352
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,460
People are saying that

353
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,700
you're selling cold drinks

354
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,180
and ice cream outside,

355
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
making tens of thousands a month,

356
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,420
but only paying a few hundred yuan
in rent to the factory.

357
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,340
They say you are taking advantage
of the factory,

358
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,940
and they want to drive you out.

359
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,140
Master, don't listen to their gossip.

360
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,740
A few hundred yuan?

361
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Last year, Xiaolu and I

362
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,140
personally talked to Secretary Hong.

363
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,020
The rent is clearly stated as

364
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,820
2,000 yuan per month, in black and white.

365
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,380
We haven't taken advantage
of the factory.

366
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,580
Master, it's true.

367
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,180
No need to explain.

368
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,780
You two are my apprentices.

369
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,140
How could I not trust you?

370
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,740
But, you know,

371
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,660
a tall tree catches the wind.

372
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,140
Over these years, you've made some money,

373
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,620
and many people are envious.

374
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,380
So there's gossip.

375
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,540
You two

376
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,380
should keep a low profile,

377
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,940
or else it will undermine morale
in the factory.

378
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,180
Master,

379
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,020
our factory has been struggling
for so many years.

380
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,220
What morale is left?

381
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,060
But...

382
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,500
Yes,

383
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,980
this factory is really impoverished now.

384
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,980
But that is precisely why

385
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,060
people are short-tempered.

386
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,420
You two,

387
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,220
don't let people's envy get to you.

388
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,420
You've prospered now,

389
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,860
but you should also consider

390
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,660
the mentality of those
who are still struggling.

391
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,260
We have not prospered at all,

392
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,340
Master.

393
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,180
Look, look.

394
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,940
In the future,
when you come to the factory,

395
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,820
can you not drive this car in?

396
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,980
Just walk in

397
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,500
and don't make a grand entrance.

398
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,580
Understand?

399
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,700
Okay,

400
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,620
Master.

401
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,820
We'll listen to you.

402
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
Alright!

403
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,020
Okay.

404
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,380
I've said what I wanted to say.

405
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,540
I'll take my leave now.

406
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Take care, Master.

407
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,820
Take care, Master.

408
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,260
I just don't understand.

409
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,670
We're earning money by our own abilities.

410
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,860
Why would others be jealous?

411
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
If you have grievances,
keep them to yourself.

412
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,700
Why kick us out?

413
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,940
Haven't you seen BMWs before?

414
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It looks like...

415
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,100
Never mind.

416
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,100
Let's go.

417
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,860
Okay, just leave it here.

418
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
Thank you.

419
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,940
Bai Lan!

420
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,940
I never expected

421
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,100
you'd come back to the factory.

422
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,420
Should I call you Manager Bai
or Director Bai?

423
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,460
Cut it out.

424
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,420
I'm still Bai Lan.

425
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,300
Are you planning to stay here?

426
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,900
There are so many good hotels

427
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,740
in Fucheng.

428
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,260
Staying at the factory is convenient.

429
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,620
So I don't have to waste time
on the road.

430
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,500
Look at you, so austere.

431
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
With such a great leader like you,

432
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,580
reform finally has a chance.

433
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,860
But it'll be dark at night.

434
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,900
Will you be scared alone?

435
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,540
How about I accompany you?

436
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,060
I wouldn't dare take you away
from Li Guangnan.

437
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,540
He would kill me.

438
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,700
He wouldn't dare.

439
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,460
It's okay.

440
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,820
I can stay alone.

441
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,780
But recently, work has

442
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,380
overwhelmed me a bit.

443
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,620
I need your help.

444
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,700
I'm just a small clerk
in the Labor Department.

445
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,580
How can I help you?

446
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,740
The reason I came back this time

447
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,240
is to lead
the food factory's transformation

448
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,500
into an Italian brand

449
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,580
OEM enterprise,

450
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,700
manage working capital,

451
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,820
and turn losses into profits.

452
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,100
But this isn't an easy task,

453
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
so I need

454
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,100
a trustworthy CFO.

455
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,940
A CFO?

456
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,300
You're not talking about me, are you?

457
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,540
Of course it's you.

458
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,300
Others might think

459
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,740
you got in the factory

460
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,100
because you're Ding Dezhong's niece,

461
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,260
but I know you taught yourself

462
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,540
high school math

463
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,180
when you graduated middle school.

464
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,820
You're quick with three-digit addition,

465
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,230
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

466
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,940
When our factory distributed
year-end bonuses

467
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,980
to thousands of employees,

468
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,460
you handled it perfectly.

469
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,900
Listening to you,

470
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,380
I guess I am pretty good.

471
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,500
Definitely.

472
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,940
And after so many years in the factory,

473
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,740
you know it best.

474
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,700
So after thinking it over,

475
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,700
there's no one else I'd pick.

476
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,420
Alright, as long as I can help you,

477
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,620
I'm all in.

478
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,500
We can fight side by side again,

479
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,780
like before.

480
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,340
But this time

481
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,980
is different from before.

482
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,700
It won't be so easy.

483
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,860
The factory's short on funds

484
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,620
and has disputes inside and out.

485
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,940
There's a lot of mess to clean up.

486
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,380
If we leased out space and equipment,

487
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,980
we need to reclaim everything.

488
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,980
We have to make a clean list

489
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,740
to convince the Italians.

490
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,580
What about Xiaolu and

491
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,220
Li Guangnan's rented cold storage?

492
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,820
Do we have to reclaim that too?

493
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
I thought

494
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,780
he left the factory long ago.

495
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,300
True,

496
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,620
but for many years,

497
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,820
the factory has relied on
leasing space and equipment

498
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,380
to maintain cash flow.

499
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,500
They also relied on the factory

500
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,020
for backup.

501
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,620
The cold storage is crucial to them.

502
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,460
We should treat everyone equally.

503
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,420
I'll compensate according to the contract.

504
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,100
Have you seen Xiaolu since you came back?

505
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,460
Not yet.

506
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,700
I think you should meet him

507
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,620
and have a good talk.

508
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,380
Maybe there's room for compromise.

509
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,380
I came back to work this time.

510
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,340
I don't want him to affect my decisions.

511
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,260
What?

512
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,900
More orders?

513
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,300
No problem.

514
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,020
You're my big customer.

515
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,540
I'll make sure to accommodate you.

516
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,060
Alright, consider it done.

517
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,020
Wait for my message.

518
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,180
Alright.

519
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,740
Hello?

520
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,700
Mr. Liu,

521
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,380
there's been a change.

522
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,300
We need five more vans,

523
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,340
making it a total of ten.

524
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,100
You must arrange this.

525
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,060
Otherwise, the people of Fucheng

526
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,460
won't have ice cream tomorrow.

527
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,500
Sure,

528
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,700
I'll leave it to you.

529
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,540
Thanks.

530
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,980
I'll come by another day to thank you.

531
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,540
Alright.

532
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,180
Mr. Lu.

533
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,180
Do you have time to chat?

534
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,700
(Xiongdi Food Trading Company Ltd)

535
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,660
Try it.

536
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,620
Milk tea?

537
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,500
I invented it.

538
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,860
I don't usually make it

539
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,900
for just anyone.

540
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,340
Why did you stop pursuing
your milk tea business?

541
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,340
Because being a brand agent

542
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,740
is more profitable.

543
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,300
I came to see you

544
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,060
for business today.

545
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,220
My investment company in Shanghai

546
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,740
is preparing to acquire all the shares
of the food factory.

547
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,340
What do you mean?

548
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,220
Our board has been

549
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,860
researching Fucheng for a long time.

550
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,420
We believe

551
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
Fucheng is
one of the most promising cities

552
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,580
for development
along the southeastern coast.

553
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,420
Acquiring the food factory

554
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,820
is just the first step.

555
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,580
We plan to modernize it

556
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,180
into a manufacturing enterprise
for foreign products.

557
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,700
I didn't expect you to have

558
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,940
such strong feelings
for the food factory.

559
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,100
Not really.

560
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
I have my own motives.

561
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,380
But I'm no longer associated
with the food factory.

562
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,340
What can we discuss?

563
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,180
We need to reclaim

564
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,380
all the leased-out spaces and equipment,

565
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,540
including your cold storage,
this is necessary

566
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,140
for negotiations with our partners.

567
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,380
So you came to me

568
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,660
for this matter?

569
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,460
What else would I come for?

570
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,340
Okay,

571
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,380
then I'll tell you.

572
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,100
It's absolutely impossible.

573
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,180
Without the cold storage,

574
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,220
I have nowhere to store my ice cream.

575
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,340
Fucheng has more than one cold storage.

576
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,860
If you need,

577
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,020
I can help you find another.

578
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,300
You don't understand.

579
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,260
Ice cream melts.

580
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,980
Only the food factory's cold storage,

581
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,260
located in the city center,

582
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,940
meets our transportation standards.

583
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,060
Then I'll compensate you.

584
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,740
You can use the money

585
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,460
to rent refrigerated trucks.

586
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,420
Bai Lan,

587
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,380
I remember back when

588
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,580
we negotiated with the German expert,

589
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,020
you told me about the importance
of honoring contracts.

590
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,660
So why

591
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,180
are you now suggesting
breaking the agreement?

592
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,980
The cold storage is a vital resource
for the food factory.

593
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,980
I have to do this.

594
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,660
Sorry.

595
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,100
It's important to you,

596
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,540
but it's even more important to me.

597
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,740
Well then, name your price.

598
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,380
I don't want to discuss money with you.

599
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,020
Just leave.

600
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,020
How about double the compensation?

601
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,580
Bai Lan,

602
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,980
I think you know me well.

603
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,860
Money won't make me back down.

604
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,580
Or are you deliberately
trying to trample on

605
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,580
our relationship?

606
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,140
What relationship do we have?

607
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,980
Nothing.

608
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,300
If there's nothing else,

609
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,820
please leave.

610
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,100
Fine.

611
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
Since you don't want to talk,

612
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,300
I'll give you a week

613
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,940
to clear out the cold storage.

614
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,460
Bai Lan, don't think money

615
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,740
can solve everything.

616
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,100
Listen carefully.

617
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,180
I won't leave.

618
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,420
You are acting on impulse.

619
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,900
You have been

620
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,860
moping around today.

621
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
Lu Dajiang!

622
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,140
Ms. Tao.

623
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Why are you here?

624
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Where's Lu Dajiang?

625
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,740
He isn't here.

626
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,140
Lu Dajiang!

627
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,700
Lu Dajiang!

628
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,580
Come out, Lu Dajiang!

629
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,700
I'm not here to cause trouble!

630
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,700
You don't even dare to see me!

631
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,340
What kind of man are you?

632
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,060
Jerk!

633
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Jerk!

634
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,780
Coward!

635
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,340
You'd better be avoiding me forever.

636
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,260
Ms. Tao,

637
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
forget it.

638
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,220
I know you can hear me talking.

639
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,260
We've known each other

640
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,220
since we were teenagers.

641
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,620
We know each other so well!

642
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,060
We have gone through ups and downs
together!

643
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,900
Why are you doing this now?

644
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,580
If you don't want to see me,

645
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,180
I won't force you.

646
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
But let me tell you,

647
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,260
smoke less, drink less,

648
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
and don't cause trouble.

649
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
You'd better live well.

650
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,340

Otherwise, why not see her?

657
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,820
You never mentioned this to me

658
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,220
over the past years.

659
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,380
To be honest,

660
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,140
I couldn't possibly match her status.

661
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,860
She's a lady from a prominent family,

662
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,670
with a grandfather
who's an overseas Chinese

663
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,820
doing business abroad.

664
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,860
After the reform and opening up,

665
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,420
her father went to find her grandfather.

666
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,900
She and her mother were left at home,

667
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,700
facing bullies from local ruffians.

668
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,900
Once,

669
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,220
I encountered it

670
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,260
and couldn't just stand by, right?

671
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,500
Later,

672
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,820
she followed me wholeheartedly

673
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,100
until I got into trouble

674
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,060
and fled to Hong Kong myself.

675
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,940
She's had a tough time,

676
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,260
and we never had peaceful days together.

677
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,860
I didn't want to drag her down

678
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,540
or make her wait for me forever,

679
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,060
so I deliberately avoided her

680
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,460
to let her find a better life.

681
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,060
She thought you abandoned her,

682
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,340
but it made it harder
for her to forget you.

683
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,420
But how did she

684
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,540
become a karaoke bar owner?

685
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,140
Later, her father became

686
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,420
a university professor in Canada

687
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,940
and brought her there to study.

688
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,700
Then,

689
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,460
she didn't want to continue university,

690
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,540
so her father gave her money

691
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,660
to start a business back in China.

692
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,420
I was the one who ran away at the time.

693
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,940
Now, how can I face her?

694
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,740
Dajiang,

695
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,420

Going to Fucheng?

717
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,340
Have you thought it over?

718
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,020
I have.

719
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,180
Having connections is an advantage,

720
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,740
but it's also challenging.

721
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,100
As long as you're determined,

722
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,340
I can hand over this project to you.

723
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,060
Are you questioning my ability?

724
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm just understanding your weaknesses.

725
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,740
I'll prove it to you that

726
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,340
only I can take on this project.

727
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,460
Acquiring and rebuilding a factory

728
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
is not as simple as constructing a resort.

729
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,620
It takes at least a year or more
to get out of it.

730
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,220
Rather than engaging in something
with uncertain results,

731
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,620
I'd prefer you

732
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,820
to help me conquer different cities.

733
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,580
Since it's so challenging,

734
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,180
I want to add a condition.

735
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,660
Say it.

736
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,340
If the project succeeds,

737
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,780
I want to go independent.

738
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,420
Do you want to leave me that bad?

739
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,060
Mr. Huang,

740
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,620
you've helped me a lot over these years.

741
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,220
When I was nothing,

742
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,460
you guided me from project to project.

743
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,860
I'm grateful

744
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,100
and don't want to owe you anything.

745
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,820
But I want freedom.

746
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,740
Alright,

747
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,980
I agree.

748
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,300
But if it's not completed,

749
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,980
you'll help me for another ten years.

750
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,700
It's a deal.

751
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,980
(Director's Office)

752
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,500
(Auditorium)

753
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,380
It's regrettable that

754
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,140
under my leadership

755
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,220
for so many years,

756
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,260
our food factory

757
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,100
hasn't achieved better results

758
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,860
in the tide of reform.

759
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,980
Here,

760
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,340
I sincerely apologize to everyone.

761
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,780
(Hong Jianying, Bai Lan)
Soon, I will pass the baton

762
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,620
to a new manager.

763
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,180
Our food factory has weathered storms.

764
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,620
Who would have thought that

765
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,900
Ms. Bai Lan, who once worked

766
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,500
in our food factory,

767
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,740
would represent Huaxing Investment Group

768
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,860
and become our factory's new manager?

769
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,900
Now, let's warmly welcome

770
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,020
Ms. Bai Lan back home

771
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,380
with enthusiastic applause.

772
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,100
Now, let's invite Ms. Bai Lan

773
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
to say a few words to us.

774
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,700
Vice Mayor Bi,

775
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,780
why are you here for

776
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,860
such a small ceremony today?

777
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,380
It's the day

778
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,740
our food factory is reborn.

779
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,860
No matter how busy I was, I had to come.

780
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,740
I see.

781
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,660
Miss Bai.

782
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,580
Long time no see.

783
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,660
Hello, Mayor Bi.

784
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,220
More accurately, I am just a Vice Mayor.

785
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,380
I'm in charge of

786
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,600
the restructuring of enterprises.

787
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,100
We'll be working together again
in the future.

788
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,060
Please support our work.

789
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,300
I've always been supportive.

790
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,620
Yes.

791
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,380
Comrades,

792
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,620
I believe that

793
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,820
under Comrade Bai Lan's leadership,

794
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,620
our food factory

795
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,540
will definitely overcome difficulties

796
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,820
and be reborn.

797
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,540
The city government has 40% of the shares

798
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
of the factory,

799
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,100
right?

800
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
But today,

801
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,180
on behalf of the municipal party committee
and government,

802
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,500
I want to state that we fully support

803
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,180
Comrade Bai Lan's reform.

804
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,540
We won't rest

805
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,700
until we achieve our goals.

806
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,020
Let's applaud.

807
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,020
Let me calculate for you.

808
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,660
We had to give away two cartons

809
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,820
of Chungwa cigarettes for the van deal,

810
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,060
costing us 1,000 yuan,

811
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,820
and 500 yuan

812
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,340
for the tea factory.

813
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,940
If we rent another cold storage,

814
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,220
it will cost thousands more.

815
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,260
We've had a huge deficit this month.

816
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,100
We really can't give up that cold storage.

817
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,020
What are you looking at?

818
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,220
I'm calculating

819
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,140
how much money is needed

820
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,300
to build a cold storage in the city.

821
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,340
Are you crazy?

822
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,420
Why build one when

823
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,540
there's a ready-made one?

824
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,140
Xiaolu,

825
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,700
are you planning to compromise
with Bai Lan?

826
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,300
We definitely can't compromise.

827
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,780
But you know Bai Lan's

828
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,700
personality well.

829
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,220
We need to be prepared for both sides.

830
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,740
Bai Lan's personality?

831
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,820
I know it very well.

832
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,860
Quite stubborn.

833
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,900
But you're no pushover either.

834
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,180
Have you forgotten

835
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,460
that you are known as

836
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,140
the fiercest man in Fucheng,

837
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,940
and the man who loves Bai Lan the most?

838
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,060
Think of a way.

839
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,660
I once thought I could persuade her,

840
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,540
but today I realized that

841
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,740
after five years,

842
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,780
many things have changed.

843
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,500
If she's changed, change her back.

844
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,060
Let me tell you,

845
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,220
just set aside your so-called dignity,

846
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,540
put on some hair gel,

847
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,500
spray some perfume,

848
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,980
show Bai Lan

849
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,140
your most charming side,

850
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,220
and ask her to change her mind.

851
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,100
That's a different thing.

852
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,540
Besides,

853
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,980
I don't know what

854
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,180
she's thinking now,
whether she has a boyfriend

855
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,300
or how she's doing.

856
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,660
How can I bring this up?

857
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,940
Recall the beautiful past.

858
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,060
You two had so much sweetness,

859
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,100
and it wasn't fake.

860
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,060
If you can't be lovers,

861
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,140
can't you be friends?

862
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,420
Xiaolu,

863
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,860
Xiaoying got into a fight
with people from the factory,

864
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
and I can't stop the fight.

865
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,980
Hurry to the factory and help.

866
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,220
Who dares come near!

867
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,380
Niu Xiaoying,

868
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:09,940
let me tell you,

869
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,180
you're not an employee here anymore.

870
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,620
If you keep causing trouble,

871
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,540
the factory

872
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,780
won't protect you.

873
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,780
Ma,

874
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,300
who is this factory protecting now?

875
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,020
Is it you?

876
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,020
You?

877
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,180
Or you?

878
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,020
When outsiders come,

879
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,580
you're all like lapdogs.

880
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,100
You...

881
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,420
Fine,

882
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,420
say whatever you want.

883
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,860
Let me tell you,

884
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,500
as long as this factory exists,

885
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,660
whether it's under Hong's

886
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,980
or Bai's leadership,

887
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,540
I'll stand firm

888
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
as the head of security, right?

889
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,380
Yes!

890
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,100
Stop talking and move the boxes!

891
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
Who dares come near!

892
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,820
I dare you!

893
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,180
Hurry up!

894
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,900
Niu Xiaoying, let me tell you...

895
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,300
People from security, remember!

896
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,820
- Get down!
- No fighting!

897
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,060
- Stop!
- Get away!

898
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,740
Just move the goods, no fighting.

899
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,820
I dare you to come closer.

900
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,900
Who gave you the right
to touch our cold storage?

901
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,300
It is still under our lease.

902
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,740
I can sue you for this, you hear me?

903
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,780
Sue us?

904
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,940
Who are you going to sue?

905
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,340
What yours

906
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,740
or ours?

907
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,660
You little rascals

908
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,580
ate the factory's food,

909
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,180
lived in the factory's houses,

910
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,580
and what now?

911
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,060
Now you think you have grown up

912
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,180
and can claim things yours now?

913
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,380
Ma,

914
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,540
I understand your responsibilities,

915
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,460
but I have my principles.

916
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,820
This is our warehouse,

917
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,740
and today, no matter what you say,

918
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,700
I won't compromise.

919
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,060
Xiaolu,

920
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,100
then don't blame me.

921
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,900
- Do it!
- I dare you to come closer!

922
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,820
Stay away!

923
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,060
- Step back!
- Come up!

924
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,700
Remember, no fighting,
no physical contact!

925
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,540
Xiaoying!

926
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,060
Take this!

927
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,180
Xiaolu!

928
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,260
- Xiaolu!
- Are you okay?

929
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,380
How could this...

930
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,700
