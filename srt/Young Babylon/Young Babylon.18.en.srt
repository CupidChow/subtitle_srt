you've brought a group

and offered such sincere terms.

If I don't agree now,

40
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,650
that would really be too unkind.

for your wife.

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,910
there's only one pair

95
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,060

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,330

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,100
then back to Fucheng.

100
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,730
Luckily, I made it back today.

101
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,030

not a single one has been left behind.

These past two years,
the factory hasn't been doing well,

143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,060
and can't even afford salaries.

144
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,740

145
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,980

148
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,150
Luckily, you found him a hospital

149
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,130
to help him quit drinking.

150
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,690
Dog ended up like this

151
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,810

160

Just consider me drunk then.

161
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,180
I wouldn't say this

162
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,300
if I were not drunk.

163
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,610
Back then,

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,260
when I couldn't afford the wedding house,

165
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,060
you gave me all the money
you'd earned over the years,

166
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,020
calling it a "bonus".

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,900
But I knew deep down.

168
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,930

169
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,450

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,970
I would have lost faith in love long ago.

189
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,690
Nonsense.

190
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,280
You still believe in love?

191
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,970
You haven't had a girl in years.

192
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,020
What?

193
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,780
Still thinking about Bai Lan?

194
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,350
No way.

195
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,970
That's all in the past.

196
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,690
Indeed, it's all in the past.

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,570
It's been five years already.

198
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,690
Time flies.

199
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,810
If you had a child back then,

200
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,690
they'd be old enough
to help you with groceries now,

201
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,690
maybe even fend off drinks for you.

202
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,540
Alright, that's enough.

203
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,810
A couple of days ago, I saw Bai Lan.

204
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,610
Really? When was this?

205
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,450
In Shanghai.

206
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,690
Just after
I finished business with Mr. He,

207
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,110
I was coming down in the elevator

208
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,570
and saw her in the crowd.

209
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,330
She looked just like before,

210
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,810
wearing a white dress.

211
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,680
I really wanted to

212
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,610
say something to her,

213
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,970
but I saw she's already married

214
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,300
and has a child now.

215
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,960
You must be delirious.

216
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,500
That must be a dream.

217
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,450
You're right,

218
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,780
it was a dream.

219
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,500
If only I had really seen Bai Lan.

220
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,690
If I could really see Bai Lan again,

221
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,420
I would definitely
tell her what's in my heart.

222
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
I love you?

223
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,160
How cheesy.

224
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,500
What then?

225
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,110
Reveal your gold watch

226
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,950
and ask her,

227
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,710
"Do you regret it?"

228
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,210
What time is it?

229
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,730
I forgot to send the wedding shoes!

230
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,200
Hurry, hurry, let's go.

231
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Quickly!

232
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,940
(Happiness)

233
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,040
Oh, so beautiful.

234
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,210
You really understand fashion.

235
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,540
Could you help me with it too?

236
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,710
When Big Feet comes back,

237
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,660
it'll surprise him.

238
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,400
How's Big Feet doing in Beijing?

239
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,440
He's not even coming to my wedding,

240
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,690
is he really that busy?

241
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,540
He's been in
too many performances lately,

242
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,850
really can't get away.

243
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,830
Juan! Juan!

244
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,870
Open the door, it's me.

245
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,710
Who's there?

246
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,020
It's me, Juan.

247
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,030
What's the groom doing here
in the middle of the night?

248
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,510
The wedding's tomorrow.

249
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,060
Can't rush into things, you know?

250
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,350
I came to deliver wedding shoes.

251
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,590
Oh, that's true.

252
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,180
I asked him to buy them in Shanghai.

253
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
The shoes can come in, but you can't.

254
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,830
The bride and groom can't see each other
before the wedding.

255
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,830
Don't you understand the rules?

256
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,560
Why are you making such a fuss?

257
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,400
Xiaolu.

258
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,570
If the groom can't come in,

259
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,970
I surely can, right?

260
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,110
And who are you?

261
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,110
Who do you think I am?

262
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,060
I'm the best man.

263
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,320
Out, out, out.

264
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,380
Juan, Juan.

265
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,930
Get out of here!

266
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,000
Leave it to me, leave it to me.

267
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,540
Only the best man is allowed in.

268
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,560
Li Guangnan.

269
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,800
Get out of here!

270
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,680
Juan, Juan.

271
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,210
- Get out.
- Little Pouter.

272
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,500
Size 38, the only pair in the country.

273
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,090
Really beautiful.

274
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,300
Let me see.

275
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,320
After so many years,

276
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,570
aren't you going to say hello?

277
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,090
Li Guangnan is waiting for me.

278
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,710
I have to go.

279
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,300
- Try them on.
- Try them on.

280
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,970
What's going on?

281
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,810
- Why are you dragging me?
- Why didn't you tell me?

282
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,800
Tell you what?

283
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,640
She's here.

284
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,780
Who's here?

285
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,570
Are you pretending
or do you really not know?

286
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,330
I really don't know.
What are you talking about?

287
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,780
Bai Lan?

288
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,320
I swear,

289
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,500
I had no idea
Little Pouter invited Bai Lan.

290
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,420
After all these years,

291
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,750
the first time we meet,

292
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,690
and she sees me like this.

293
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,590
Lu Xiaolu, can you please wake up a bit?

294
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,510
It's been five years.

295
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,110
You don't even know if Bai Lan

296
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,400
has a boyfriend, or if she's married

297
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
and has kids.

298
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,690
Why do you care how she sees you now?

299
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,330
Come on, wake up.

300
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,730
You're not you from five years ago,

301
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,750
and she's definitely not her
from five years ago.

302
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,900
I don't mean anything else.

303
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,630
I just want to apologize to her.

304
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,590
Do you think it still matters to her?

305
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,020
But it matters a lot to me.

306
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,710
Fine.

307
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,860
(Happiness)

308
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,090
You are my wife now!

309
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,260
Happy wedding!

310
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
Didn't you want to apologize to Bai Lan?

311
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,070
You two will ride the car behind.

312
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,130
Everything's arranged for you.

313
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,840
Half an hour in the car,

314
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,220
you can apologize a hundred times.

315
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,400
Just you?

316
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,830
Yeah,

317
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,640
Bai Lan said
she has something to attend to,

318
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,030
so she'll go to the restaurant later herself.

319
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,810
Let's go ahead.

320
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,550
Let's go.

321
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,200
Xiaolu,

322
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,540
are you alright?

323
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm fine.

324
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,070
If there's something,

325
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,300
you have to tell me.

326
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,170
These years, thanks to you and Guangnan,

327
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,270
me and Dumb Jar can

328
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,300
live the life we have now.

329
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,850
Don't say that.

330
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,300
Our company has come this far

331
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,170
thanks to everyone's efforts.

332
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,540
Working for you and Guangnan,

333
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,890
we've gained some dignity.

334
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,510
Just yesterday evening,

335
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,740
I heard Guangnan's mom

336
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,790
saying,

337
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,590
thank goodness Guangnan
went into business with you,

338
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,350
made some money,

339
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,510
otherwise, those relatives of his dad

340
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,220
back in the village wouldn't have come.

341
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,460
People, you know,

342
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,810
when you're poor,

343
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,810
not a single visitor shows up,

344
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,700
but now that Guangnan has money,

345
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,130
they all come bearing gifts.

346
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,680
His dad went to the restaurant

347
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,940
early this morning.

348
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,570
Ten tables of people.

349
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,500
But the bride's side is different,

350
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,020
her relatives
can't even fill half a table,

351
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,740
even Little Pouter's only elder,

352
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,460
her aunt, didn't come.

353
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,070
Those people will definitely

354
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,540
gossip about later.

355
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,160
Pig Teeth, pull over here.

356
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,260
Xiaolu, where are you going?

357
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,780
To handle something. You go ahead.

358
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Okay.

359
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,390
Congratulations!

360
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,890
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, thank you.

361
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,170
Thank you, thank you.

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,740
Welcome, welcome.

363
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,600
Hey, not bad, Dog.

364
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,170
Your red envelope is the thickest today.

365
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,440
Master.

366
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,060
This is thick, Xiaoying.

367
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,510
How much money

368
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,400
have you earned

369
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,570
with Xiaolu and Guangnan?

370
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,990
It's not just from me,

371
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,410
it's from me and Big Feet together.

372
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,460
Since he couldn't come back from Beijing,

373
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,700
we put in more

374
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,980
as an apology.

375
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,310
We even made fun of Big Feet back then,

376
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,360
crazily insisting on
going to Beijing to sing.

377
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,680
We all thought he'd be back

378
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,300
in less than a month,

379
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,710
but who would've thought?

380
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,880
Yeah, no one could have imagined this.

381
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,840
He's made a fortune,

382
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,790
while we couldn't even get our salaries
at the factory,

383
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,790
barely having porridge to eat.

384
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,610
It's not as good as you think.

385
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,330
Actually, he's under a lot of pressure.

386
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,360
Even though he can earn
a few thousand for one performance,

387
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,260
- A few...
- it's tough work.

388
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,960
A few thousand?

389
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,230
Is that true?

390
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,270
In one performance,

391
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,060
he makes more than
what we earn in a year?

392
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,300
This is mine.

393
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,980
- Let me tell you.
- Come here.

394
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,120
What is it?

395
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,700
Can you stop boasting?

396
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,170
Did Big Feet really send you money?

397
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
He did.

398
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,610
Don't think I can't see it.

399
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,960
These days, you've been saving every bit,

400
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,940
not even buying meat.

401
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,130
Look at you now, so thin.

402
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,170
You think I'm stupid?

403
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm dieting.

404
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,800
You don't understand.

405
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,640
You silly child.

406
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,480
I...

407
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,800
Hey, you...

408
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,890
When she was with Li Guangnan,

409
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,780
she should have known
this day would come.

410
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,070
I've provided for her

411
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,610
so well all those years,

412
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,160
and then

413
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,400
she just ran off with someone

414
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,300
who harmed her uncle.

415
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,630
Now she wants me to attend her wedding?

416
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,700
Don't you think that's too much to ask?

417
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,260
But, Auntie,

418
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,130
as far as I know,

419
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,120
besides your son,

420
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,810
you have no other children.

421
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,460
And now, with Ding Yu's situation,

422
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,640
haven't you thought about

423
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,810
the issue of old age support?

424
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,940
She broke my heart.

425
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,680
Old age support?

426
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,750
I don't care about that.

427
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,780
When I'm old,
I'll find a place where no one is,

428
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,410
and just die there.

429
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,740
If you die,

430
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,020
what will your son do?

431
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,460
Why are you here?

432
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,810
I'm afraid you'll act impulsively

433
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,460
and make a decision
you'll regret for life.

434
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,260
What do you mean by that?

435
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,570
I just heard

436
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,220
last month,
an old lady died in this building,

437
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,540
and no one found that out
for half a month,

438
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,790
until it started smelling,

439
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,030
and someone finally called the police.

440
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,170
Ah, a lonely old lady,

441
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,700
and they say she had a terrible temper,

442
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,410
so her children
didn't want to come see her,

443
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,170
even the maids left after a few tries.

444
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,680
Wait,

445
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,510
what are you implying?

446
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,410
If she knew this would be the result,

447
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,570
who knows if she would regret it
in the beginning.

448
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
Auntie,

449
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,980
did you know this old lady?

450
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,270
Stop acting here.

451
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,470
One talking to me nicely,

452
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,370
the other trying to scare me,

453
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,810
acting here with me.

454
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,200
I won't fall for this.

455
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,740
I won't fall for this.

456
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,260
Hey, Debao, are we starting or not?

457
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,650
Just a moment.

458
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,590
How is it?

459
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,160
Can your relatives still come?

460
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,220
We can't delay this any longer.

461
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,650
Just wait a little longer.

462
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,600
Honey, be happy.

463
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,570
Everyone is watching.

464
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,890
I'm getting married, and there's no one
from my family here.

465
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,500
That's not true.

466
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,780
I'm your family.

467
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,260
And my parents are also your family.

468
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,550
Don't worry.

469
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,020
You won't be alone anymore.

470
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,780
It's time to start.

471
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,960
We can't delay any longer.

472
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,810
I shouldn't have put those two
in the same car.

473
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,020
Could they have eloped?

474
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,410
Although this sounds frightening,

475
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,060
what I'm saying is all true.

476
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,940
Think about it.

477
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,790
Who helped you get your son

478
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,980
into the best hospital?

479
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,090
And who helped renovate
this old house for you?

480
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,940
During festivals and holidays,

481
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,780
who always greets you and sends gifts?

482
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,000
Auntie,

483
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,370
you know
what Little Pouter has done for you

484
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,460
all these years better than anyone.

485
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,650
Forget it.

486
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,130
Juan said

487
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,850
she willingly did this for Auntie

488
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,090
and she doesn't expect Auntie
to thank her.

489
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,940
But, you know,

490
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,330
she thinks Auntie
is the closest person to her.

491
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,150
She really...

492
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,810
She said that?

493
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,570
Last night, she told me

494
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,810
she remembers all the good things

495
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,410
you've done for her over the years.

496
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,130
When she had a high fever
in middle school,

497
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,460
you carried her to the hospital at night

498
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,170
in pouring rain,

499
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,090
preferring to get soaked yourself

500
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,940
rather than letting her
touch a drop of rain.

501
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,570
She always remembers these things.

502
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,740
She remembers it?

503
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,850
When she told me last night,

504
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,780
her eyes were swollen from crying.

505
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,610
On this joyful day,

506
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,090
if you can't be there to witness it,

507
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,850
Juan will be very sad.

508
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,500
If you really don't want to go,

509
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,130
we won't force you.

510
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,020
We'll just tell Qin Juan that

511
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,020
you don't want to be her aunt anymore

512
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,810
and let her just give up.

513
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,470
And from now on,

514
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,780
you two will never see each other again.

515
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,170
Little Pouter
won't come to bother you again.

516
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,440
Let's go.

517
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,330
You... You two...

518
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,980
You shouldn't sow discord between us.

519
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,310
Who...

520
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,020
Who said I don't acknowledge her?

521
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,700
Are you willing to go with us then?

522
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,090
On this joyous day,

523
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,990
we gather here

524
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,060
to witness
this beautiful moment together.

525
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,360
I now declare the wedding ceremony
officially begins.

526
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,610
Great!

527
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,330
Yes!

528
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,610
- Wait a moment.
- Juan.

529
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,890
Auntie!

530
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
Juan.

531
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,330
I'm sorry

532
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,410
I'm late.

533
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,740
Not late at all.

534
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,960
Juan,

535
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,890
you're a good girl.

536
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,850
You always have been
since you were little.

537
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
Although

538
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,410
so much has happened,

539
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,020
and I have been upset with you,

540
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,570
I raised you since you were little.

541
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,890
In my heart,

542
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,850
you're like my daughter.

543
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,780
Today is your wedding day,

544
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,170
I am happy,

545
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,310
so happy.

546
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,850
Really.

547
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,700
Great!

548
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
It's a happy day,

549
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,940
no crying, come on.

550
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,130
Don't cry.

551
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,790
Be happy.

552
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,220
Look how beautiful you are.

553
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,550
No more crying.

554
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,350
No more crying.

555
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,830
It's a happy occasion.

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,340
I brought you an umbrella.

749
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,430
Thank you.

750
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,250
How have you been

751
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,690
all these years?

752
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,350
Very well.

753
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,460
How did you get the scar on your arm?

754
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,380
So you followed your cousin's old path.

755
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,160
Speaking of which,

756
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,540
when will he be out?

757
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,610
They reduced his sentence by two years.

758
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,070
But after he got out,

759
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,290
he didn't want to stay in Fucheng.

760
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,500
He'll be back soon.

761
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,570
I think once my cousin is back

762
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,540
and sees where I am today,

763
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,060
he'll be happy for me.

764
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,500
It seems like you're doing well now.

765
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,800
Sort of,

766
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,910
but not really.

767
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,460
My mom...

768
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,060
I really didn't know that.

769
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,760
She...

770
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,130
She had pancreatic cancer,

771
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,940
late-stage.

772
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,820
I believe she's happy

773
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,980
in heaven.

774
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
I have to go.

775
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,240
Bai Lan,

776
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm sorry.

777
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,540
Back then, I lacked the courage

778
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,250
to say goodbye to you in person.

779
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,420
I was a deserter,

780
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,250
leaving you alone to face everything.

781
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,400
The apology has been pent up in my heart

782
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,610
for five years.

783
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,060
I know that it won't change things.

784
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,190
I know you would be mad at me,

785
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,540
or even hate me.

786
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,500
But I still want to say sorry.

787
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,980
Truly, I'm sorry.

788
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,080
Lu Xiaolu,

789
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,020
it's all in the past.

790
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,770
Let's look forward.

791
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,500
I've long since let go.

792
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,090
I hope you can too.

793
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,740
