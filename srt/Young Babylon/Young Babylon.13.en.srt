Captain Bai Lan

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,860
It's okay.

31
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,100
Get some more sleep.

32
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,380
The breakfast will be ready soon.

33
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,540
The last dish.

34
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,940
Not bad.

35
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,140
Try them.

36
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,980
Try this first.

37
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,820
Fish ball soup.

38
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,260
Doesn't it taste good?

39
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,540
Bai Lan,

40
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,740
although the steak you cooked before

41
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,900
wasn't good,

42
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,540
it's still much better than this fish ball.

43
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,220
How did you know I made the steak?

44
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
What do you think?

45
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,660
In Fucheng,

46
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,860
not many cooks would

47
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,340
cook vegetables with roots

48
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,060
or fish with gills.

49
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,500
Then try this.

50
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,980
Alright, no one is forcing you to eat.

51
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,100
Come on.

52
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,060
When you go to Shanghai,

53
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,430
you don't have to cook anymore.

54
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,100
Just leave it to me.

55
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,060
Do you think we'll be able to

56
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,330
successfully make it to Shanghai?

57
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,420
Of course.

58
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,060
If it weren't for you,

59
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,780
I might never take the college
entrance exam again.

60
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,580
Since I've decided,

61
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,500
I'll definitely succeed.

62
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,620
Will we have our own home

63
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,340
in Shanghai?

64
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,230
Definitely.

65
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,580
By then,

66
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,470
we'll buy a small television

67
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,820
and a record player.

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,280
If you don't want to stay in the house,

69
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,620
I'll take you to eat your favorite

70
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,260
steak and coffee every day.

71
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,420
But you can't eat steak every day.

72
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,660
There's so much
delicious food in Shanghai,

73
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,300
like soup dumplings,

74
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,260
pan-fried buns,

75
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,240
and yellow croaker noodles.

76
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,020
We'll try them all.

77
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,860
Yeah,

78
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,060
we should try them all.

79
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,940
Hey, I heard that Shanghai

80
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,860
has built a very tall TV tower.

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,620
I really want to go see it.

82
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,980
Sure.

83
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,260
Bai Lan, you may not know that

84
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,580
after my cousin was arrested,

85
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,460
I didn't know

86
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,860
where my life was heading.

87
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,620
Fortunately, I met you,

88
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,780
and for the first time,
I feel like my life has a direction.

89
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,980
Will we always be together?

90
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,620
Yes.

91
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,220
Definitely.

118

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,380
By the way,

121
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,340
are you really planning

122
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,860
to not talk to Xiaolu anymore?

123
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,940
He was the one who was being

124
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,860
disloyal and heartless.

125
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
He's just pursuing

126
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,980
his own love and life.

127
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,140
What's wrong with that?

128
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,220
Actually, I don't blame him.

129
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,660
I blame myself.

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,940
I owe him a lot.

131
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,580
Wait,

132
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,060
you guys are good friends.

133
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,100
How could you

134
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,940
owe him anything?

135
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,700
If I tell you,

136
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,020
will you promise not to hate me?

137
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,580
I have known you for so long.

138
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,420
I won't hate you for anything.

139
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,100
Li Guangnan, you're a jerk!

140
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,620
You said you wouldn't hate me!

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,300
I had no choice at the time.

142
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,660
Lu Xiaolu has been so good to you,

143
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,900
and so has Lu Dajiang.

144
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,020
You're just a traitor.

145
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,860
No, come on.

146
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,020
Xiaolu,

147
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,820
you seem energetic today.

148
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,380
You've finished work so quickly.

149
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,820
This is my last shift after all.

150
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,180
I won't come here tomorrow.

151
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,660
Why?

152
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,940
Are you going back to the repair team?

153
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,180
No,

154
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,340
I'm going to take
the college entrance exam.

155
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,060
Get lost if you don't want to work!

156
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,020
The factory doesn't need
slackers like you.

157
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,300
With your donkey brain,

158
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,180
you think you can make it to college?

159
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,660
What's wrong with going to college?

160
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,100
Going to college
is disrupting production,

161
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,540
it's like a parasite in the factory.

162
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,020
Do you know why the efficiency

163
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,900
of the factory is so bad?

164
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,820
It's because of people like him,

165
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,900
they're always

166
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,140
thinking about leaving.

167
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,020
How can they work well like that?

168
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,220
Cut the crap!

169
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,580
Watch your mouth!

170
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,300
Lu Xiaolu, what are you doing?

171
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,820
Do you also want to go to college?

172
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,740
Chen Guowei,

173
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,900
clean up the sugar syrup.

174
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,860
From now on,

175
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,460
you'll carry sacks together

176
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,420
with Lu Xiaolu in the warehouse.

177
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,500
Whose motorcycle is this?

178
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,980
It's mine.

179
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,660
What?

180
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,700
How did you afford a motorcycle?

181
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,980
It's none of your business.

182
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,100
Lu Xiaolu,

183
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,300
let me remind you.

184
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
Don't show off too much.

185
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,260
You might fall.

186
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Is that so?

187
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,180
Let's wait and see.

188
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,660
Okay.

189
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,820
Xiaolu,

190
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,660
do you think I'm done for?

191
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,700
It's not a big deal.

192
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,140
I get scolded every day,

193
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,460
but I'm still doing fine.

194
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,100
But I'm not like you.

195
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,900
Your mom is the union chairwoman,

196
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,460
your dad is a factory cadre,

197
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,900
and your cousin is Lu...

198
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,140
Honestly,

199
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,860
I envy you.

200
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,780
My dad passed away early,

201
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,660
my mom's health is poor,

202
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,700
and we have no money at home.

203
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,620
Everything depends on me.

204
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,580
If I don't succeed,

205
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,460
everyone will

206
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,580
look down on me,

207
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,180
including Xiaoying.

208
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,780
But now,

209
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,900
before I could go to college,

210
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,740
I've become a parasite in the factory.

211
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,540
Stop it.

212
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,180
Don't bring that

213
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
old fart's words to heart.

214
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
For so many years,

215
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,500
you've been the most

216
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,580
dedicated worker in the factory.

217
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,820
It's not your fault that
the factory is not doing well.

218
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,460
Is that so?

219
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
Big Feet,

220
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,620
you must study hard,

221
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,780
and you must keep going.

222
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
You have your future.

223
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,660
He can see the end of his life already.

224
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,220
But how can I study?

225
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,500
I don't even have any books left.

226
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,240
I shouldn't have studied.

227
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,030
If I hadn't studied,

228
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,690
I wouldn't have been distracted
and fallen asleep.

229
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,490
If I hadn't fallen asleep,

230
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,900
I wouldn't have forgotten
to change the can.

231
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,190
If I hadn't forgotten to change the can,

232
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,230
the syrup wouldn't have spilled.

233
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,210
Don't worry about it.

234
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,700
I have to go clean it up.

235
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll go with you.

236
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
Really?

237
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,940
Don't take it to heart.

238
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,340
Okay.

239
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
What is this?

240
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,340
Don't you understand what I said?

241
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,900
I wanted Buddha Jump and
Pickled Bamboo Shoots Fish.

242
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,340
What is this that you've given me?

243
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,940
Those are dishes meant for humans.

244
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,740
- You're not worthy of them!
- You...

245
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,620
What?

246
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,540
Now that the factory's in trouble,

247
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,380
yet you're

248
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,780
enjoying lavish meals every day.

249
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,220
If accountability were to be placed,

250
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,900
you'd be the first one to face the axe.

251
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,740
Comrade Niu Xiaoying,

252
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,020
please clarify your words.

253
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,420
Don't accuse others unfairly.

254
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,060
I'll clarify it right now.

255
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
You wait.

256
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,100
Xiaoying! Xiaoying!

257
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Why didn't you stop her?

258
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
I tried but failed.

259
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,180
Extra! Extra!

260
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,220
Exclusive news!

261
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,260
Do you know

262
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,580
how capable

263
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,820
Director Ding is?

264
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,020
When the price of eggs went up,

265
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,580
even the canteen couldn't get enough.

266
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,420
But his family

267
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,220
were throwing them into the trash can.

268
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,130
Every time the canteen received
ten tons of vegetables,

269
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,820
he would take one ton for himself.

270
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,220
Not only did he embezzle,

271
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,020
he also purchased expired food
for kickbacks.

272
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,060
Without any evidence,

273
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,260
you are spreading rumors!

274
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,100
Rumors?

275
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,580
Zhang, the food material deliverer,

276
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,060
is a distant relative of yours.

277
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,940
Do you think I don't know what you did?

278
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,860
Last July,

279
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,860
dozens of people in the factory
got food poisoning.

280
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,700
Why?

281
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,980
Because he

282
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,500
bought cheap diseased pork
from the countryside!

283
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,640
Plus the expired canned goods
from this year,

284
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,020
and gutter oil from the year before.

285
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,780
Just the canteen's operations alone,

286
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,500
he's done so many unethical things.

287
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,380
You're the biggest parasite
in our factory!

288
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,220
- Well said!
- Well said!

289
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,660
This is madness!

290
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,380
Don't listen to her nonsense.

291
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,420
Where are the security guards?

292
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,020
- You are still eating!
- Security guards!

293
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,300
You always rely on the security guards!

294
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,820
Xiaoying! Xiaoying! Calm down!

295
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,540
- Don't be impulsive.
- Don't resort to violence.

296
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,300
- Don't use violence.
- What are you doing, Ding Dezhong?

297
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,380
I know the reason now.

298
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,100
You're defending

299
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,460
Chen Guowei, right?

300
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
So what if I am?

301
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,100
You know clearly how many

302
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,340
unethical things you have done.

303
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,380
You tore his book up,

304
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,580
so I'll tear you up!

305
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,420
Nonsense!

306
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,980
I'm telling you all,
I will discipline you!

307
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,060
Go ahead and discipline us.

308
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,740
I've been wanting to leave anyway.

309
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,180
Fine, I'll fulfill your wish.

310
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,260
Madman, slacker, rat droppings.

311
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,620
People like you should be expelled.

312
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,380
Xiaoying, calm yourself!

313
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,460
Xiaoying! Xiaoying!

314
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,580
Calm down!

315
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,460
Big Feet!

316
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,580
- Big Feet.
- Are you alright?

317
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,180
I'm fine, I'm fine.

318
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,940
Xiaoying's hits don't hurt.

319
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,100
Alright.

320
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
Here.

321
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,340
Are you okay?

322
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,180
We're almost there.

323
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,780
I don't understand.

324
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,940
Why did you do that?

325
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,980
What benefit does

326
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,580
offending Ding Dezhong bring to you?

327
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,300
I have offended him enough already.

328
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,680
One more time won't make a difference.

329
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,860
He bullied Afang, demoted Bai Lan,

330
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,760
and framed Dajiang up.

331
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,400
I should've settled this score with him
long ago.

332
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,060
There's a saying,

333
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,260
"It's easy to deal with a gentleman,

334
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,660
but hard to guard against a villain."

335
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,380
Someone like Ding Dezhong

336
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,140
will make sure to get back at you.

337
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,420
What am I afraid of?

338
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,020
I'm leaving soon anyway.

339
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,580
I will be so far away from him.

340
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,860
Can he reach Shanghai?

341
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,700
What?

342
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,020
You don't think I can pass,

343
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,900
do you?

344
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,940
Believe it or not,

345
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,500
in the two practice exams,

346
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,020
I was first in the whole class.

347
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,260
Really?

348
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,500
See?

349
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,820
That's my son.

350
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,460
My son is smart of course.

351
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,980
If you don't pass this year,

352
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,940
you'll try again next year.

353
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
Xiaolu,

354
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,620
it's not that I don't support you,

355
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,100
but you need to be mentally prepared.

356
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,020
For what?

357
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,860
I just received news that

358
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,420
this time the factory

359
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,940
only has one spot

360
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,820
for study in Shanghai.

361
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,540
Secretary Hong!

362
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,380
Secretary Hong!

363
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,980
Secretary Hong is out of town.

364
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,620
What's the matter?

365
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,660
Let me ask you,

366
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,580
is it true that there's only one spot

367
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,420
for studying abroad

368
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,380
this year?

369
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,140
You're well-informed.

370
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,260
Why?

371
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,490
There were always three to five spots
available in previous years,

372
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,460
but why not this year?

373
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,940
The factory's performance isn't good
this year.

374
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,660
If we lose more workers now,

375
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,660
it'll only make people more unsettled.

376

Everyone wants to leave.

377
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,460
What will the factory do?

378
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,180
It'll just become an empty shell.

379
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,900
No way.

380
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,340
Don't lie to me.

381
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,900
Call Secretary Hong yourself

382
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,220
and see if it's true.

383
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,060
I know you want to leave.

384
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,020
This place is like stagnant water,

385
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,300

386
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980

387
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,260
suffocating.

388
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,820
Who doesn't want to leave?

389
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,580
But who can escape?

390
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,940
Some things

391
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,980
are destined from birth.

392
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,300
You can't escape,

393
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,100
and neither can I.

What about next year?

395
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,500
Just wait and see.

396
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,740
Everything will only get tighter

397
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,540
as the factory

398
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,860
gets through this rough patch.

399
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
How long do we have to wait?

400
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,620

many things
that might happen in the future.

476
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,980

I mean if,

484
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,740

Yes, I can.

You agreed so quickly,

487
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,060
you didn't even ask me why.

489
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,980

00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,980
Or did you already know the outcome?

565
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
I care.

566
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,460
Of course, I care.

567
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,220
I was just afraid I didn't do well,

568
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,460
so I went to the movies.

569
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,340
Don't lie to me.

570
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,220
I called the provincial examination office,

571
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,030
and they said they didn't
have your results at all.

572
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,460
Explain this to me.

573
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,660
I didn't write my name.

574
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,220
I really didn't write my name.

575
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,940
There were several questions
I couldn't answer

576
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,900
and left blank.

577
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,820
I thought if the results came out

578
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
and my name was announced,

579
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,860
it would be so embarrassing.

580
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,980
So I...

581
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,420
You ranked in the top three
of the cram school.

582
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,260
How bad could it be?

583
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,420
Okay, I confess.

584
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,780
I confess now.

585
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,820
I went drinking with Li Guangnan.

586
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,220
I got drunk.

587
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,060
The next morning,

588
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,740
my head was buzzing like hell.

589
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,140
How could I do the test?

590
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,460
I definitely wouldn't know anything.

591
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,020
You went drinking the night
before the exam.

592
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,320
Did you really not have a clear mind,
or do you just not want to leave?

593
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,060
Can you stop lecturing me?

594
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,260
Yes, you're right.

595
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,620
I just don't want to leave.

596
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,260
I don't want to leave Fucheng.

597
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,300
Fucheng is my home.

598
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,680
Li Guangnan and the others are waiting
for me to do business.

599
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,500
Here is great.

600
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,780
But Shanghai...

601
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,220
What's so good about Shanghai?

602
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
I don't know anyone there.

603
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,860
What would I gain
from going to Shanghai?

604
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,900
You are serious?

605
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,900
I bought that cream

606
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,340
specially for you when I went to

607
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
take the exam in Shanghai.

608
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,820
I thought you might like it.

609
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,540
It's the hottest brand this year,

610
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,330
and you can't get it
anywhere else but Shanghai.

611
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,580
Are you

612
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,660
really leaving like this?

613
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,580
Yeah.

614
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,740
Shanghai is quite far from here, right?

615
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,980
Actually, it's not that far.

616
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,260
If you take a boat

617
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,180
and then a train,

618
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,460
it'll take about two days.

619
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,540
Oh, by the way,

620
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,180
I don't need these stuff anymore.

621
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,500
Can you help me dispose of it?

622
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,100
You don't want any of these things
that are still usable?

623
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,020
I want to leave behind some memories

624
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,780
and not take them with me.

625
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,060
What about me?

626
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
After you go to Shanghai,

627
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,260
will you forget about me?

628
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,260
Don't be silly.

629
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,100
Once I settle down there,

630
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,540
I'll write to you and call you.

631
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,420
It's a promise.

632
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,780
Promise.

633
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,060

We're all working overtime tonight
to catch up on production.

640
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,060
The factory can't pay wages.

641
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,860
Why is she back again?

642
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,490
Maybe she failed
making a living out there.

643
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,140
Why does she look like she's been fired?

644
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,820
Someone with no conscience like her

645
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,180
deserves to be fired.

646
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,220
The other day I heard,

647
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,140
she got a job in the bureau.

648
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,900
How did she end up back here?

649
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,220
She's superficial

650
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,260
and lacking in integrity.

651
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,340
I've always thought she was like this.

652
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,700
Exactly.

653
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,220

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,620
Let me tell you,

661
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,740
it's fate that made you stay.

662
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,180
Are you

663
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,220
feeling a bit smug now?

664
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,540
Xiaolu, I do not understand

665
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,940
why you can't just explain things
clearly to her.

666
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,380
What should I say?

667
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,780
Should I tell her that

668
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,820
I gave up my spot for her,

669
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,900
so she'll feel guilty

670
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,420
and grateful to me forever?

671
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,300
Have you thought about

672
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,980
taking the exam again next year?

673
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,740
Of course I have.

674
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,100
But who knows
if there will even be a spot

675
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,020
available next year?

676
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,220
I can't let her hold onto uncertain hope

677
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,740
and wait for me.

678
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,940
Besides,

679
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,180
even if I could go to Shanghai next year,

680
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,660
she might not accept me anymore.

681
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,180
You see, you're quite
clear-minded about this.

682
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,780
There's a saying,

683
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,540
when fate arrives, accept it.

684
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,340
If you can't go to Shanghai,

685
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,940
let's focus on running our business well.

686
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Who needs that degree?

687
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,500
We can still make money.

688
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,020
Come on.

689
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,540
But are you feeling upset

690
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,020
about not going to Shanghai?

691
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,020
Are you trying to get yourself drunk?

692
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,420
Drink.

693
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,100
Li Guangnan,

694
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,900
I've had enough of you

695
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,860
always talking about money.

696
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,740
Look at you.

697
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,700
Can't you have some higher aspirations?

698
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,740
Lu Xiaolu,

699
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,580
do you know that I'm fed up with you too?

700
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,700
Your mouth is full of ideals

701
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,060
and dreams.

702
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,100
And you want to go to a big city.

703
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,500
What's so good about big cities?

704
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,500
You bumpkin,

705
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,940
you know nothing.

706
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,420
So what if I'm a bumpkin?

707
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,020
And what about you?

708
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,460
Do you think you're some celestial crane?

709
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,020
Let me tell you,

710
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,060
you're

711
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,100
at most just a

712
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,460
decent rooster

713
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,820
that

714
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,260
wants to fly high.

715
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,500
See?

716
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,340
You are down on the ground.

717
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
I'll tell you,

718
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,580
even if I'm a rooster,
I'm a fighting rooster.

719
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,980
The two of us together are a team.

720
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,140
What team?

721
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,420
Bumpkin Rooster Stew!

722
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,100
What are you saying?

723
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,980
But sounds delicious.

724
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,140
Li Guangnan,

725
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,300
actually, staying here isn't bad at all.

726
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,980
You're right.

727
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,380
I was being heartless before.

728
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,340
It's not that you're heartless.

729
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,860
It's that you were too sentimental.

730
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,820
I was the one being heartless.

731
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,380
You and Dajiang

732
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,140
treat me so well,

733
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,420
yet I betrayed you.

734
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,540
Not just Little Pouter
who looks down on me,

735
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,500
I look down on myself too.

736
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,460
What are you saying?

737
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,300
What do you mean?

738
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,700
I, Li Guangnan,

739
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,460
as an employee of the skating rink,

740
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,540
under Lu Dajiang's command,

741
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,700
engaged in illegal activities.

742
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,980
Now, I admit my mistakes

743
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,700
and report to the authorities,

744
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,340
hoping for leniency.

745
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
What are you saying?

746
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,060
They forced me to do it.

747
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,390
Otherwise,
both of us would end up in jail.

748
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,140
Xiaolu, I'm begging you.

749
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,420
You jerk!

750
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,660
I treated you like my best brother.

751
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,260
How could you do that to me?

752
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,460
My cousin treated you
like his own younger brother.

753
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,700
How could you do that to him?

754
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,500
Wretch!

755
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,180
Jerk!

756
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,060
Wretch!

757
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,980
Jerk!

758
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,620
Wretch!

759
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,580
Xiaolu,

760
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,500
I owe you so much.

761
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,020
As long as I have

762
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,100
something to eat,

763
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,820
I will never forget you.

764
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,420
From now on,

765
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,460
we are not friends anymore.

766
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,980
Dad,

767
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,220
I want to continue cooking for him.

768
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,340
Li Guangnan,

769
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,060
what's wrong with you?

770
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,260
How did you get injured like this?

771
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,860
What?

772
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,540
I

773
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,260
told Lu Xiaolu about it.

774
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,780
He told me

775
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,380
he'll never forgive me.

776
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,260
For over ten years,

777
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,420
Lu Xiaolu was my only friend.

778
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,860
But he told me

779
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,460
I'm not his friend anymore.

780
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,940
Why?

781
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,580
I desperately

782
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,020
try to

783
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,220
keep all of you here,

784
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,740
but why don't any of you want me?

785
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,860
Why?

786
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,100
What did I do wrong?

787
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,140
I will be with you.

788
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,980
I'll always be there for you.

789
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,500
What's that sound?

790
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,060
The boiler exploded.

791
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,900
Poisonous gas!

792
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,740
Come down quickly.

793
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,340
Hurry, hurry, run!

794
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,140
Earthquake, earthquake!

795
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,980
It's an earthquake!

796
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,940
- Hey, Xiaolu.
- Mom, what's wrong?

797
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,900
People are running out
due to the explosion,

798
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,540
why are you running inside?

799
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,300
Dad, Mom, you go first, hurry.

800
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,620
- Where are you going?
- You go first.

801
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,060
Why do you want to go in there?

802
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,660
Xiaolu, are you trying to kill yourself?

803
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,260
Mom, go, go!

804
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,100
You crazy kid,

805
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,940
where are you going?

806
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,340
Bai Lan,

807
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,460
have you lost your mind?

808
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,400
It's exploding
and you're not running away.

809
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,660
Are you afraid of death?

810
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,220
Aren't you afraid of death?

811
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,500
I'm not afraid of death,

812
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,460
but you're afraid
of even going to Shanghai.

813
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,980
Coward.

814
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,220
Bai Lan,

815
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,860
I love you.

816
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,540
Xiaolu,

817
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,500
I'm sorry.

818
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,220
Why apologize?

819
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,620
(Gongyuan)

820
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,780
I've figured it out.

821
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,020
I was wrong from the beginning.

822
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,700
I shouldn't have disrupted your life

823
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,820
and taken away your happiness.

824
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,620
You belong here.

825
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,820
Maybe here is where you can

826
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,980
truly be yourself,

827
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,380
but I don't belong here.

828
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,140
So in the end, we have to part

829
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,820
and return to our own worlds.

830
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:04,460
(Safety First)

831
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,980
Hey, comrade.

832
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,180
Wait, wait.

833
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,140
- Have all the passengers boarded?
- Yes.

834
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,980
We're ready to set sail.

835
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,500
Comrade,

836
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,820
please do me a favor.

837
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,660
I want to order a song

838
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,540
dedicated to someone.

839
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,620
Hmm, go ahead.

840
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,180
Bai Lan!

841
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,100
Bai Lan!

842
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,100
Bai Lan!

843
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,540
Dear passengers,

844
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,300
all our crew members

845
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,140
greet you

846
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,460
and wish you a pleasant journey

847
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,780
and a safe trip.

848
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,900
Next, we'll play a song

849
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,260
ordered by someone

850
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,740
for his friend,

851
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,980
