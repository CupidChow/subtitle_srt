=Young Babylon=

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,040
How did I offend you?

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,630
You've been following me repeatedly

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,910
and even wrote me a threatening letter.

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,480
And the letter says,

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,270
"Don't take what belongs to others".

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,600
What does that mean?

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
Do you remember when we first met

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,990
in the dormitory water room?

32
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,030
Have you talked to Director Ding
at the administration office?

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,520
If you want to study abroad,

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,710
you have to go through him.

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
I've talked to him.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,590
He said I could take the exam,

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,010
but whether I can get in

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,110
depends on me.

39
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,960
There are so many spots in the factory.

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,550
It's not like only one of us can do that.

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,740
Why are you targeting me?

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,830
You are wrong.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,030
The spots for us workers

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,640
are already very limited.

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
I

46
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,840
begged Ding Dezhong for a long time

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
and paid a great price,

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,520
and he agreed to give me a spot.

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,550
But just a few days ago,
he suddenly changed his mind,

50
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,620
saying that the spot was taken
by a cadre.

51
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,710
I checked,

52
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,200
and you're the only one
who's taking the exam this year.

53
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,640
The spots for workers are already limited,

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
why do you have to take it away from me?

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,270
Do you have no conscience?

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,310
But you're wrong.

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm not the one who took your spot.

58
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,750
Who else could it be?

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,030
It's Ding Dezhong who has no conscience.

60
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,400
But no matter what, what you're doing

61
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,310
won't solve any problems.

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040
Forget it.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Just go.

64
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,860
(Lounge, Security Department)

65
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,580
(Gongyuan)

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,960
Lu Xiaolu, could you hurry up?

67
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm waiting to work here.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,580
Why are you rushing?

69
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Why don't you fix it yourself?

70
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,100
Look at this, does it look easy to fix?

71
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,740
What is this? A rebellion?

72
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,020
If I could fix it myself,

73
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,540
why would I need to ask you?

74
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,940
Take a look. Does this look like

75
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,100
it was drawn by a child?

76
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,580
Why does it look like
it was from a fight?

77
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,420
Come here,

78
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,220
take a look.

79
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,060
Nail marks.

80
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,900
Why do I feel like

81
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,300
these were made by a woman?

82
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,100
Stop talking nonsense!

83
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,500
What's wrong, Director Ding?

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,340
Why are you so mad?

85
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,620
It's just a joke.

86
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,180
That joke isn't funny at all.

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,540
Ding Dezhong,

88
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,980
you deserve a tragic death.

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,540
If you don't uphold justice today,

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,020
I'll jump from here.

91
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,220
Don't tell anyone

92
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,580
you saw me today.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,860
Remember my words.

94
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,780
My guess is so accurate?

95
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,980
=Episode 5=
=Smooth Cooperation=

96
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,580
What if she really jumps?

97
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,420
We need to save her.

98
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,780
We can't save her.

99
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,380
She directly blamed

100
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,520
Ding Dezhong.

101
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,020
There's an old saying that goes,

102
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,600
"The one who tied the bell should untie it."

103
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,660
Isn't that right, everyone?

104
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,700
Yes!

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,620
Hey, Afang!

106
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,420
Calm down!

107
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,820
The factory leadership

108
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,660
will definitely resolve your issue.

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,940
You must believe, you must...

110
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,340
She is accusing the factory leadership.

111
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,730
And you're still talking about leadership.

112
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,420
Do you know what it is?

113
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,580
You might as well just push her off.

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,760
- Shut up.
- Good for nothing.

115
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,260
Can you two stop talking for a moment?

116
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,900
Alright, everyone, be quiet.

117
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,020
Shut up.

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,380
Saving a life is the priority.

119
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,820
Afang,

120
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,500
let's talk.

121
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,700
How old are you this year?

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Oh, you're 24.

123
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,300
A 24-year-old

124
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,260
should stop being so stubborn.

125
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,820
You need to believe that

126
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,420
the factory will never mistreat you.

127
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,940
We will speak up for you.

128
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,980
The factory will never ruin your future

129
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,100
over such a small matter.

130
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,100
We will never allow anyone

131
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,340
to harm you,

132
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,720
regardless of their status.

133
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,020
This sounds like the right thing to say.

134
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,260
If anyone is

135
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,420
causing trouble in the factory,

136
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
I, Bi Zhigang,
will be the first to oppose it.

137
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,460
- Well said!
- Great!

138
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,020
I'll be the first one to stand up for you.

139
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Quiet down.

140
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,490
What nonsense are you talking about?

141
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,340
- Quiet down.
- I didn't...

142
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,500
Why are you defending her?

143
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,940
Mrs. Ding, please.

144
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,980
Don't say anything, okay?

145
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,860
Am I talking too much?

146
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,980
Security, maintain order.

147
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,940
Quickly, quickly.

148
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,700
Hey, Afang...

149
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,220
Enough! Enough!

150
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,300
Hey, everyone, listen to me.

151
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,060
Who's causing trouble here?

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,420
It's her!

153
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,060
She's causing trouble,

154
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,420
accusing my husband here.

155
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
She is the troublemaker!

156
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,540
- I'm not causing trouble.
- You're slandering him!

157
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
I'm not slandering him!

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,740
I'm not!

159
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,340
Alright, alright.

160
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,860
You didn't slander, right?

161
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,060
Will anyone stand up to testify for you?

162
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,140
Who can testify for her?

163
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,740
I can.

164
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,380
Oh, how did he get up there?

165
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,980
Afang, calm down.

166
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,220
Why did you come up?

167
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,300
You step back.

168
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,100
If you come one step closer, I'll jump.

169
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,260
We can testify for you.

170
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,020
Really!

171
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,860
That day,

172
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Wednesday night,

173
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,940
in the administrative office,
it was you, right?

174
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,700
I thought I was mistaken at the time,

175
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,700
but now I understand everything.

176
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,700
We really saw it.

177
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,180
We believe you.

178
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,020
We can definitely help you get justice.

179
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,020
You can trust us.

180
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,660
Come on, give me your hand.

181
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,820
Listen to me, all of you.

182
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,870
I, Lu Xiaolu, can testify that

183
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,540
Afang did not slander Ding Dezhong.

184
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,500
- Great!
- Bravo!

185
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,460
Stop yelling!

186
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,420
Stop it!

187
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,060
Why are you cheering?

188
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,300
Lu Xiaolu,

189
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,940
you're lying.

190
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,780
Do you know

191
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,700
she's lying?

192
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,980
She's lying!

193
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,380
Hey, enough, enough.
What are you all looking at?

194
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,780
There's nothing to see here.

195
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,540
It's time to work, not to waste time.

196
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,060
Go on, disperse.

197
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,260
Unbelievable.

198
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,460
Why are you shouting so loudly?

199
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,980
Um, I...

200
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,730
I just wanted to know
if Afang is seriously injured.

201
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,020
She's fine.

202
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,020
I will stay with her.

203
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,740
And what about you?

204
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,740
Are you injured?

205
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
Is that your concern?

206
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,660
Go back to work now.

207
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,300
Whether I work or not doesn't matter.

208
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,540
What matters is that you don't get hurt.

209
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,700
I'm the one who's hurt.

210
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,700
Why are you everywhere?

211
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,140
What are you doing here?

212
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,300
Secretary Bi,

213
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,460
you're showing concern for everyone.

214
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,380
I...

215
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,060
But why don't you show concern for me?

216
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,260
What is this?

217
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,460
Get off me!

218
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,740
Disgusting.

219
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,900
Afang... Afang fainted!

220
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,750
Quick, quick, quick!

221
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,770
(Fucheng People's Hospital
Collaborative Guidance Hospital)

222
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,660
You didn't see anything that day,

223
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,940
yet you came forward just now.

224
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,260
Because I knew that

225
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,820
even if I didn't come forward,

226
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,220
you would still jump out.

227
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,540
You still think you don't have enough
enemies in the factory?

228
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,540
Aren't you the same?

229
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,860
We are the same kind.

230
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,460
As for Ding Dezhong, that old scoundrel,

231
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,740
I've disliked him for a long time.

232
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,660
This is a good opportunity
to teach him a lesson.

233
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,460
But what about you?

234
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,660
Didn't you say

235
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,100
you were a selfish person?

236
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,620
Why are you getting involved in this?

237
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,900
But speaking of which,
it's quite miraculous.

238
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,420
Just a few days ago, we were discussing

239
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
how to catch the flasher,

240
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,860
and today
we're thinking of how to help her.

241
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,820
Yeah,

242
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,660
it's really miraculous.

243
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,980
The two of us were mortal enemies

244
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,230
a few days ago because of this matter,

245
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,420
and now we're allies.

246
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,020
Doctor.

247
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,220
Doctor, how is Afang?

248
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,380
It's nothing serious.

249
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,680
She'll be hospitalized for a few days.

250
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,420
Alright, then you go back first.

251
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,860
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her these days.

252
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,220
They say that

253
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,660
what goes around comes around,

254
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,340
but sometimes,

255
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,820
even heaven turns a blind eye.

256
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,260
Hey, the big hero is back.

257
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,980
Lu Xiaolu,

258
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,740
the hero who saved the beauty,

259
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,540
is back in the limelight.

260
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,740
But let me ask you,

261
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,140
are you really going to testify about

262
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,940
Ding Dezhong and Afang?

263
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,180
Of course.

264
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,460
What's wrong?

265
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,300
What's with all your looks?

266
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,340
Then let me ask you,

267
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,500
if the factory office

268
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,660
asks you to testify,

269
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,980
will you dare?

270
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,540
Let me ask you, Xiaolu,

271
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,380
if this goes to court,

272
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,220
will you dare to testify?

273
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,900
If the factory sides with Ding Dezhong

274
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,620
and fires you, what will you do?

275
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,020
What do I have to fear?

276
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,940
Come on, Xiaolu,

277
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,500
I think everyone's concerns are valid.

278
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Ding Dezhong has been in the factory
for so many years,

279
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,260
he must have taken roots.

280
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,380
If you confront him like this,

281
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,830
will you still have a future here?

282
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,740
Li Guangnan,

283
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,780
why are you siding with him?

284
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,140
I'm not siding with him.

285
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,460
I'm definitely standing with Afang.

286
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,940
But if you go against Ding Dezhong,

287
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,380
Little Pouter
will be in a difficult position.

288
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,780
Master,

289
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,980
how do you see this?

290
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,940
Man,

291
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,620
this situation

292
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,980
has gotten deep.

293
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,300
Hello?

294
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,060
Okay, wait a minute.

295
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,540
Lu Xiaolu,

296
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,460
your mom's calling.

297
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,540
Hello, Mom.

298
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,460
I went to the city labor union today
for something,

299
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,700
and you've made trouble again.

300
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,940
Come home right now.

301
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,180
Mom.

302
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,980
She's angry?

303
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,940
Mom,

304
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,660
I rushed home after you

305
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,860
told me to.

306
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,260
Come on.

307
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,820
Come here.

308
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,300
Do as your mom says.

309
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,460
Don't go against her.

310
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,780
Sign this.

311
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,540
Apology letter?

312
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,820
I, Lu Xiaolu,

313
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
at a critical moment

314
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,780
to save my factory colleague
Liu Fang's life,

315
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,420
had to falsely claim that

316
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,340
I saw Director Ding Dezhong
mistreating her.

317
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,780
Mom, what does this mean?

318
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,260
It's not a false claim.

319
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,740
Keep reading.

320
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,660
Do it. Keep reading.

321
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,220
Director Ding is a just person

322
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,580
who has always worked tirelessly
and selflessly

323
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,460
for the factory.

324
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,980
But in this sudden situation,

325
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,700
I resorted to this strategy to save a life

326
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,340
and told a white lie,

327
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,820
which unfairly damaged

328
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,660
Director Ding's reputation.

329
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,420
Director Ding, please forgive...

330
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,300
Mom, what does this mean?

331
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,380
Let me say it again.

332
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,780
I didn't lie.

333
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,900
This is nonsense.

334
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,740
I can't sign this.

335
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,660
Nonsense?

336
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,180
You talk tough.

337
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,100
This is to save your life.

338
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,860
If you offend Ding Dezhong

339
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,540
and he fires you,

340
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,660
what other factory
will dare to take you in?

341
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,940
Are you going to end up on the streets?

342
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,260
Even if I become a street beggar,

343
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,620
I won't apologize to Ding Dezhong.

344
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,460
Fine.

345
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,540
Okay.

346
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,040
You just go

347
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,420
be a street beggar.

348
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,580
Don't even call me your mom anymore.

349
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,300
I won't be involved in your affairs.

350
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,340
Dad,

351
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,860
Mom,

352
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,220
since I was young, you taught me

353
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,220
not to confuse right and wrong,

354
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,060
and to be truthful.

355
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,300
Isn't that right?

356
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,660
Was that

357
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,060
just a joke?

358
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,860
How can that be a joke?

359
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,820
Our family values have been

360
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,860
passed down for generations.

361
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,420
We must be

362
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
honest and trustworthy,

363
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,140
right?

364
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,100
What does that mean?

365
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,540
Are you two trying to say

366
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,220
I'm an evil person?

367
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm a villain to you, right?

368
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,620
No.

369
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,790
I'll take responsibility
for my actions alone.

370
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,100
I won't sign this document.

371
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,020
You've grown up.

372
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,460
A man should seek justice,

373
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,500
and help the weak.

374
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,640
That's what my cousin should be like.

375
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,500
Dajiang,

376
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,580
are you supporting me?

377
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,580
But there's a saying,

378
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
"Those who know
when to retreat are wise."

379
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,300
The mess in the factory won't be
resolved easily.

380
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,540
Even if you step up now,

381
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,500
it won't change anything.

382
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,540
Why are you talking like my dad?

383
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,220
Standing up now

384
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,740
can at least bring justice to Afang.

385
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,340
If I hide like a turtle,

386
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,620
how am I any different from

387
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,660
that scoundrel Ding Dezhong?

388
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,820
Lu Xiaolu,
you're so full of righteousness.

389
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,340
My uncle is a scoundrel.

390
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,300
Then what am I?

391
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,860
Why are you here?

392
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,100
I called her here.

393
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,660
Your mom was getting upset,

394
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,300
so I had no choice.

395
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
Have a seat.

396
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,500
Say it.

397
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,140
Say what?

398
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,380
Your cousin said you'd apologize to me

399
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,540
for yesterday's incident,

400
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,380
so I'm here.

401
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,460
Apologize?

402
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
Apologize for what?

403
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,820
For falsely accusing my uncle,
hitting my aunt,

404
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,900
and embarrassing me.

405
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,860
Little Pouter,

406
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,260
don't you know what kind of person

407
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,620
your uncle is?

408
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,980
Besides,

409
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,140
I didn't accuse you of anything,

410
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,340
how could I have embarrassed you?

411
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,340
Lu Xiaolu, do you have to do this to me?

412
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,140
How did I offend you?

413
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,860
Just because my uncle is Ding Dezhong,

414
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,100
everyone hates me.

415
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,220
You all look down on me.

416
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,580
Don't say that.

417
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,060
You're you, and they're them.

418
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,060
I don't mix you up with them,

419
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,580
and I don't look down on you.

420
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,980
Lu Xiaolu,

421
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,500
listen to me.

422
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,900
Don't speak up for Afang anymore.

423
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
You have no proof.

424
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,220
Go apologize to my uncle and aunt first.

425
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,260
Then I'll try to help you explain.

426
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,660
If they still won't let you off,

427
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,340
I'll throw a tantrum and cause a scene.

428
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm going to cry and make a scene.

429
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,380
Lu Xiaolu,
I'm doing this for your own good.

430
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,580
If you don't apologize,

431
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
you'll be fired.

432
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,900
I don't want that for you.

433
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,060
I know you mean well,

434
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,060
but today I need
to make it clear to you that

435
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,780
even if I'm fired,

436
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,420
I won't compromise on this matter.

437
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,260
Lu Xiaolu!

438
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,060
You stubborn Lu Xiaolu!

439
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,260
Stubborn!

440
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,620
Stubborn!

441
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,180
Director Ding.

442
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,900
What are you doing here?

443
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,940
I came to see

444
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,100
how Auntie is doing.

445
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,100
A small gift.

446
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,620
She's doing well.

447
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,940
But I'm not.

448
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,780
It seems she misunderstood anyway.

449
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,980
Misunderstood?

450
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,260
Sit down.

451
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,020
I heard you made a great effort that day

452
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,980
when Afang lost control,

453
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,420
saying comforting words

454
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,660
to prevent a disaster.

455
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,460
It was the least I could do.

456
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,220
But my promise to speak up for her

457
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,420
was conditional. She had to be

458
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,420
telling the truth.

459
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,060
If she was spreading rumors

460
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,300
and harming others,

461
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,300
that would not be acceptable.

462
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,340
So, do you think

463
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,300
what she said was true?

464
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,860
Impossible.

465
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
Everyone knows that

466
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,630
Afang was not in her right mind.

467
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,900
She was talking nonsense.

468
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,820
She's crazy?

469
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,980
Very delusional.

470
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,620
Everybody thinks so.

471
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,760
That's the only possibility.

472
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,020
That's right!

473
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,260
But that Lu Xiaolu

474
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,700
was just fanning the flames.

475
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,780
I have never offended Zhao Lizhen.

476
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,300
Why does her son always
have a problem with me?

477
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,300
Lu Xiaolu isn't crazy.

478
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,020
He's just an evil person. You know?

479
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,900
He spreads rumors with sinister intentions.

480
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,180
- Exactly.
- We need to deal with him.

481
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,940
What

482
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,540
should I do from now on?

483
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,660
Mental illness is serious.

484
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,940
We can't make baseless claims.

485
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,100
We need proof.

486
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,700
Proof?

487
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,660
Dr. Bai can provide a medical certificate.

488
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,340
Bai Lan is

489
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,300
quite educated,

490
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,920
but she has trouble
distinguishing right from wrong.

491
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
Uncle Ding,

492
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,500
trust me,

493
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,540
if you agree,

494
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,260
let me handle this.

495
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,260
Can you handle it?

496
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,340
We have a close relationship.

497
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,180
Good for you, boy.

498
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,140
You could even handle that ice queen.

499
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,740
You're promising.

500
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,420
My dad is my role model.

501
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,140
Yes, indeed.

502
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,180
How do you plan to handle her?

503
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,860
If you can't bear the pain,

504
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,940
you can take one

505
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
of these painkillers,

506
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,860
but no more than three a day.

507
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,420
Dr. Bai,

508
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,620
I'm sorry

509
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,300
for how I treated you before.

510
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,940
It's okay.

511
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,780
That's in the past.

512
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,420
Two years ago,

513
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,380
I passed the exam,

514
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,700
but Ding Dezhong gave the quota

515
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,620
to the son of the beverage
department director,

516
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,180
blocking my chance.

517
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,140
Last year,

518
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,820
when I passed again,

519
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,030
he said there were no quotas left
in the factory.

520
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,380
Later, I found out

521
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,760
the quota went to the son
of the finance department director.

522
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,300
One day, he came to me

523
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,660
and asked if I still wanted
to take the exam this year.

524
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,460
I said yes.

525
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,580
He said

526
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
passing exams on paper was useless.

527
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,020
I'd never succeed that way.

528
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,860
If I wanted to succeed,

529
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,460
I had to satisfy him first.

530
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,820
I repeatedly refused him,

531
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,100
but he persisted.

532
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,300
Eventually, I discovered that

533
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
this year's quota
went to another cadre's child.

534
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,300
I confronted him,

535
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,860
but he warned me to stay out of it.

536
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,940
I didn't dare offend him.

537
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,940
I thought about it many times.

538
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,940
And I only heard that

539
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,780
you were the one
who would take the exam.

540
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,820
So I thought the connected person

541
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,660
was you.

542
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,020
I...

543
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,820
I had no choice.

544
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,820
I didn't know what to do,

545
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,860
so I ended up doing that foolish thing.

546
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,820
Alright, Afang,

547
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,860
don't be afraid.

548
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,500
These people who bully you

549
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,100
aren't as powerful as they seem.

550
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,460
Fight back,

551
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,060
and who knows who will come out on top?

552
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,100
If you dared to dress up
as a pervert to threaten me,

553
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,100
why be afraid of an old man?

554
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,580
She was fine when I was here just now,

555
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,700
but she's crying when she sees you.

556
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
Why are you here?

557
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,380
Xiaolu came to take care of me.

558
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,060
And he brought me

559
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,340
these books from the library.

560
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,460
Oh, you are all here.

561
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,820
Afang,

562
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,620
I'm here
on behalf of the factory to visit you.

563
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,060
You need to rest

564
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,780
and not think about anything right now.

565
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,620
If you need anything, just let me know.

566
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,220
I'll do my best to help you.

567
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,540
Bai Lan,

568
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,700
come with me for a moment.

569
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,940
I have something to discuss with you.

570
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,340
Just say it here.

571
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,380
Well...

572
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,340
We shouldn't disturb her rest.

573
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,220
Let's talk outside.

574
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,700
What?

575
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,140
A certificate of mental illness?

576
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,060
Yes,

577
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,100
this matter has escalated too much.

578
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,220
It's the best solution

579
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,300
and a way to protect Afang.

580
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,900
You know that

581
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,980
after the factory leadership
found out about this,

582
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,060
they were very angry

583
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,580
and wanted to fire her directly.

584
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,460
So, I think

585
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,620
if we issue her

586
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,300
a mental illness certificate,

587
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,540
it proves she's crazy.

588
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,730
Crazy people can talk without
consequences, right?

589
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,580
Besides,

590
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,180
if she has this illness,

591
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,060
the factory will have to support her.

592
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
Isn't that protection?

593
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,660
You're truly a responsible cadre.

594
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,580
It's my duty.

595
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,240
I'm just a small factory doctor.

596
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,340
I don't have the authority to issue
a mental illness certificate.

597
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,300
That's okay.

598
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,020
You just need to issue it

599
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,740
on behalf of the factory clinic.

600
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,900
I'll handle the rest.

601
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,860
What if I don't issue it?

602
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,340
Is there a problem?

603
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,940
If the factory can't even protect

604
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,780
a sober worker,

605
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,380
how can they protect a crazy one?

606
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
Alright,

607
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,900
I didn't want to tell you this,

608
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,340
but since you insist,

609
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,220
I'll relay Director Ding's words to you.

610
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
You can consider them.

611
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,780
Director Ding said that

612
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,780
Bai Lan is an outstanding female comrade,

613
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,140
but she has some issues with

614
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,980
how she handles things.

615
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,220
Like before, when she clashed

616
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,380
with superiors in school

617
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,030
and even physically assaulted someone,

618
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,180
which led to disciplinary action

619
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,500
and her transfer to our small place.

620
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,660
If she still can't

621
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,220
adapt here,

622
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,420
then let her go.

623
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,100
She deserves freedom.

624
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,100
We shouldn't stand in her way.

625
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,100
I'll translate this for you.

626
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,380
It means

627
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,380
if I don't issue
the mental illness certificate,

628
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,340
then I'll be fired.

629
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,620
This isn't what I want.

630
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm doing this for your own good,

631
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,980
to make you understand the seriousness
of this matter.

632
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,300
The factory still
hasn't come to a conclusion.

633
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,180
Could they be trying to protect
Ding Dezhong?

634
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,420
How come I heard that

635
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,340
Afang just couldn't

636
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,660
pass the exam herself,

637
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
deliberately trying to smear

638
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,940
Ding Dezhong's reputation?

639
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,100
Rumors are just rumors.

640
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,580
You think you are
some kind of an informer?

641
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,580
After so many years, everyone knows

642
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,420
Ding Dezhong's character.

643
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,210
Even when going out for a meal,
he always finds chances

644
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,390
to touch the hands of the waitresses.

645
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,340
His wife has beaten him up
many times for that.

646
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,620
How will the factory handle this matter?

647
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,180
Police investigation

648
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
also requires evidence.

649
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,900
Based on

650
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,740
just Xiaolu's words,

651
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,300
I suspect this matter will be swept
under the rug.

652
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,300
Yeah.

653
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,980
It shouldn't be like this.

654
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,020
It's so unfair to Afang.

655
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,220
Normally, you're as timid as a kitten.

656
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,740
Never thought
you could stand up for justice.

657
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,460
Thank you.

658
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,540
Today's braised pig trotters are all yours.

659
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,780
Thank you, Xiaoying.

660
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,620
Hey, Xiaolu,

661
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,860
what do you think?

662
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,060
As long as you say the word,

663
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,640
I'll be the first
to take care of Ding Dezhong.

664
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,980
You're just a young girl.

665
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,260
Stop pretending to be tough!

666
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,900
I was just saying.

667
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,980
- Are you full?
- Yes, I'm full.

668
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,020
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, I'm full.

669
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,100
Time for you to go home.

670
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,020
Alright, Master.

671
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,140
Thank you, Master.

672
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,460
- Alright.
- Bye, Master.

673
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,580
- The pig trotters...
- Hey, Xiaolu.

674
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,700
Take them, take them.

675
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,980
They're really delicious.

676
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,260
Just a little left.

677
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,300
Put it down!

678
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,380
Didn't you say one cup?

679
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,980
Just this little bit.

680
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,900
We will...

681
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,580
Come on, Master.

682
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,500
Cheers.

683
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,380
Xiaolu,

684
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,380
what do you think about
Ding Dezhong's matter?

685
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,260
What can I think?

686
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,460
We have so many hammers and tools

687
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,500
in the maintenance department.

688
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,380
I don't believe we can't crush
one or two pests.

689
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,780
Good.

690
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,220
Looks like

691
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,540
I didn't misjudge you, you rascal!

692
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,060
When encountering injustice,

693
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,500
draw your sword to help,

694
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,140
whether it's in hell

695
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,860
or in heaven,

696
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,660
we'll smash them to pieces.

697
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,820
But,

698
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,140
let me tell you,

699
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,140
you're like a good piece of material,

700
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,700
good steel.

701
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,180
You have to take yourself seriously,

702
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,500
understand?

703
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,100
Good steel

704
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,060
should be used for cutting.

705
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
When facing a problem,

706
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,300
don't rush.

707
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,860
Haste makes waste

708
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,140
and can sometimes hurt yourself.

709
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,300
Understand?

710
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,180
What do you mean?

711
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,100
Are we just going
to stand by and do nothing?

712
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,500
Since when did you become a coward?

713
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,920
Where's that spirited attitude you had
when you were young?

714
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,820
I passed it all to you!

715
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,140
I'm telling you,

716
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,780
Afang is too weak.

717
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,860
If Ding Dezhong dares to do that to me,

718
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,700
I'll grab a knife and stab him.

719
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,420
Look at you.

720
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,340
Like you would really stab him.

721
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,620
Why not?

722
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,740
You...

723
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,260
Xiaoying is right.

724
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,420
Why can't she stab him?

725
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,180
Hey, I'm telling you...

726
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,020
You two...

727
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,300
Master, I'll take my leave.

728
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,100
- No, wait...
- He just left like that?

729
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,940
Xiaolu...

730
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,260
I hope you understood what I said.

731
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,460
Hey...

732
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
(Gongyuan Golden Peacock Food Factory)
This is the certificate you wanted.

733
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Why did you...

734
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,460
If you had done this earlier,

735
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,340
we wouldn't have had to argue last time.

736
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,780
I carefully considered what you said,

737
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,820
and you're right.

738
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,210
I don't want trouble.

739
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,380
But I'm just a mere factory doctor.

740
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,820
This can only be a reference,

741
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,220
not legal evidence.

742
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,860
This step is crucial.

743
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,180
With this certificate,

744
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,460
I can hand over the rest

745
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
to a doctor at the hospital.

746
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,660
Really?

747
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,020
You're that capable?

748
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,780
It's not that impressive.

749
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,340
This is a small matter

750
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,180
that's within my ability.

751
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,780
So, tomorrow.

752
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,260
Tomorrow, I'll take care of it.

753
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,860
Okay.

754
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,980
I hope I can be of help.

755
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,460
Have some tea.

756
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,260
That's enough already.

757
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,940
I've really been wronged.

758
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,860
Look, I have the diagnosis certificate

759
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,740
from the factory here.

760
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,980
She's a psychiatric patient

761
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,340
with delusions.

762
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,580
Why should I look at it?

763
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,100
Do I not know

764
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,180
what kind of person you are?

765
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,700
You have to look at it.

766
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,740
There's the red stamp from our factory.

767
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,300
Alright, come on.

768
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,900
Swear to heavens.

769
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,940
Repeat after me.

770
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,060
From now on,

771
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,900
I won't talk to young female workers
in the factory.

772
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,300
Can you make sense?

773
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,420
How can I work in the future?

774
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
What work?

775
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,500
It's not allowed.

776
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,380
Alright, alright. I swear, I swear.

777
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,780
Can I stand up?

778
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
My legs are about to break.

779
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,930
Just keep your knees on the ground.

780
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,020
What's that sound?

781
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,680
Someone's knocking on the door?

782
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,020
It's all my fault!

783
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,100
Please spare me!

784
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,420
I admit that I did it!

785
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,700
Afang, I'm sorry.

786
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,900
Please spare me.

787
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,860
Afang,

788
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,900
you reported Ding Dezhong

789
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,220
for harassing you

790
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,340
and mistreating you.

791
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,430
The factory is conducting
a serious investigation.

792
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,700
Don't worry,

793
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,180
as long as we have solid evidence,

794
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,980
we will handle him seriously.

795
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,820
(Report Letter)
This is a joint letter

796
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,700
from some factory workers

797
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,060
reflecting all of Ding Dezhong's issues.

798
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,940
So the factory has decided to

799
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,780
deduct his bonus for three months,

800
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,460
issue a severe warning,

801
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,700
and publish a punishment notice
throughout the factory.

802
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,340
Does hearing this

803
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,740
make you feel better?

804
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,860
Now,

805
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,340
if you have any demands,

806
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,740
Afang, feel free to speak up.

807
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,180
As long as it's within my capabilities,

808
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,620
I will grant you it.

809
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,620
Director asked you a question. You...

810
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,020
Afang, don't be afraid.

811
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,780
If you have any demands, tell Director Liu.

812
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,980
I heard you want to study at night school

813
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,820
to get a diploma.

814
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,100
That's a good thing.

815
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,620
It shows a positive pursuit.

816
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,620
As long as you pass the exam,

817
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,380
the factory will not only provide you
with a recommendation letter

818
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,180
but also apply for paid study leave for you.

819
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,660
How about that?

820
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,340
No,

821
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
I want to resign.

822
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,540
I don't want anything.

823
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,180
I just want to leave here completely.

824
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,140
Alright,

825
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,540
I agree.

826
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,300
I'm still in this position now,

827
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,300
and I will fulfill your wish.

828
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,780
But if I'm not in this position one day,

829
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,140
others may not value your matter as much.

830
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,980
Hey, Director, what do you mean by this?

831
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,420
Times have changed,

832
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,940
and I also want
to explore the world outside.

833
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,540
You can go back now.

834
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
Time to say goodbye.

835
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,420
You'll be in an unfamiliar environment,

836
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,420
don't let yourself be bullied again.

837
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,740
If you're bullied,

838
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,620
fight back.

839
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,260
Never swallow your pride.

840
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,380
Also,

841
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,020
you must become strong

842
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,700
so others won't dare to bully you.

843
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,700
Dr. Bai,

844
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,020
Xiaolu, I can't imagine

845
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,300
what I would have become

846
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,660
without you.

847
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,500
Maybe I would have silently endured

848
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,660
and buried these dirty things inside.

849
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,620
Maybe I would have
given up all my dignity

850
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,420
and never held my head up here.

851
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,940
Or maybe

852
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,820
that day on the rooftop,

853
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,980
I would have jumped.

854
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,540
Those are all in the past.

855
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,100
Every day from now on

856
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,900
is a brand new day.

857
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,940
That's right,

858
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,100
even if you're bullied, don't be afraid.

859
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,220
Just give me a call,

860
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,460
and I'll go beat them up.

861
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,530
The bus's here.

862
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,380
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

863
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,340
(Gongyuan)

864
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,620
I'll remember.

865
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,140
You two are my lifelong friends.

866
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,100
Until we meet again.

867
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,860
Don't break your promises.

868
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,380
Certainly.

869
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,620
Take care.

870
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,620
Goodbye.

871
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,340
Afang said

872
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,420
we're her lifelong friends.

873
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,220
So, that also

874
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,060
makes us lifelong friends.

875
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,340
Instead of an enemy,

876
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,380
you want to be my friend now?

877
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,700
(Fucheng Gongyuan Golden Peacock
Food Factory)

878
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,940
The day Afang had trouble,

879
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
my mom asked me to go home

880
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,380
and asked me a question.

881
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,100
What question?

882
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,580
She asked why I rushed forward

883
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,340
in Afang's matter and

884
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,980
if it was because of your influence.

885
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,740
What did you say?

886
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
I said no at the time,

887
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,420
but now I think

888
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,940
maybe.

889
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,100
Are you blaming me
for leading you astray?

890
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,540
Actually, if it weren't for you,

891
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,980
I really don't know
if I would have given up at some point.

892
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Maybe when my mom made me sign
a letter of apology

893
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,420
or when my cousin

894
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,980
made me apologize to Little Pouter.

895
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,980
Or it could have been when I saw you

896
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,940
almost getting hurt

897
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,180
by that ballbuster.

898
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,580
But every time I realize there's

899
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,380
a crazy woman like you by my side

900
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,540
who can charge with me together,

901
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,820
I think,

902
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,300
who cares what others think?

903
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,660
So, in that case,

904
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,580
we're quite like-minded.

905
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,980
So,

906
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,340
do you want to consider
being friends with me?

907
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,260
You have so many thoughts,

908
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,120
and you do things without considering
the consequences.

909
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,580
I'll have to think about it carefully.

910
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Together, we'd be unstoppable.

911
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,340
It would be a shame if we couldn't be

912
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,700
