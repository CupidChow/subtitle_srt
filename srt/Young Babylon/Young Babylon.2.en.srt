This is my mask, Uncle Ma.

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,850
Why is it with you?

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,460
That's for you to answer.

30
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,920
What were you doing last night?

31
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,440
Last night?

32
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,060
I went to watch videos with Li Guangnan.

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,700
We came back around midnight.
What's wrong?

34
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,720
What videos did you watch?

35
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,900
Why do you care about that?

36
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,740
Tell me.

37
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,520
"Once Upon a Time in China 3"

38
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,280
and

39
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,400
"The Provocative Lady".

40
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,920
Aren't you too young to watch that?

41
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,060
It's just the name that's a bit provocative.

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,460
It's actually nothing like that.

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,580
We were tricked.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,760
Alright,

45
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,320
show me the tickets.

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Those underground theaters
don't sell tickets,

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,380
Uncle Ma.

48
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,300
What's wrong?

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
Why are you interrogating me?

50
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,780
Tell me,

51
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,880
what's going on?

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,740
Stand up.

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,240
Who told you to sit down?

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,460
Let me tell you,

55
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,800
last night,

56
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,240
that pervert in a raincoat
appeared again.

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,640
This thing

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,440
fell off him.

59
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,440
Are you suspecting me?

60
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,520
Why not?

61
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,320
How come it's you again?

62
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,100
You're falsely accusing me!

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,600
The evidence is here.
Is it a false accusation?

64
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,820
I swear this mask

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,320
must have been stolen by someone.

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,380
It's just what you say.

67
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,540
Listen,

68
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,740
why would I do such despicable things?

69
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,460
"Our grudge isn't settled yet."

70
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,740
Didn't you say this yourself?

71
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,260
Fine.

72
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,660
You don't believe me, right?

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,300
Then go ask Li Guangnan.

74
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,380
He's the most honest person.

75
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,500
He won't lie.

76
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Do you doubt that

77
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,980
Li Guangnan is an honest person?

78
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,020
That makes sense.

79
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,940
But I'm really not lying.

80
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,500
Alright, go back for now.

81
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,340
But

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,380
we'll continue the investigation.

83
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,260
Whether it's you or not,

84
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,380
the truth will come out eventually.

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,220
Alright,

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,020
when the truth comes out,

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,300
don't forget to apologize to me.

88
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,780
Hey, Xiaolu,

89
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,900
that's evidence.

90
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,140
Give it back to me.

91
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,180
Dr. Bai,

92
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,820
do you think he looks like that...

93
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,260
But you were just...

94
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,180
So I...

95
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,100
I couldn't say that to him.

96
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,180
It's okay.

97
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,460
I have a way.

100
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
Have you heard?

101
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,980
That pervert appeared again last night.

102
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,140
But in the end,

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,660
he was driven away

104
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,500
by Dr. Bai.

105
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,300
Dr. Bai

106
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,540
usually looks

107
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,620
quite weak and delicate.

108
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,700
I didn't believe those rumors before.

109
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,860
But after what happened last night,

110
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,420
I started to doubt it.

111
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,580
Well, by the way,

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,540
Dr. Bai is always

113
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,460
dressed so provocatively.

114
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,980
No wonder
she attracted the pervert's attention.

115
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,940
Do you want to try it?

116
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,940
Dr. Bai taught me this. It is delicious.

117
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,980
No.

118
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,060
Let me tell you,

119
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,020
women shouldn't dress too provocatively,

120
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,220
let alone invite trouble actively.

121
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,260
What's wrong with you?

122
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,460
Oh, Dr. Bai...

123
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,540
You finished your lunch? Sit down.

124
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,420
You look so good today.

125
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,300
- Isn't it, Dr. Tian?
- Yes. Yes.

126
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,460
- Aunt Dong,
- Yeah?

127
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,860
even if I dress like you,

128
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,380
perverts would still appear.

129
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,780
Well said.

130
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,820
Perverts don't choose their targets,

131
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,340
and they don't care about age or status.

132
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,460
- No, this...
- Dr. Bai,

133
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,020
I rushed over as soon as

134
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,660
I heard about yesterday's incident.

135
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,220
Are you alright?
Did the pervert hurt you?

136
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,060
You're alright?

137
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,060
Of course I'm alright.

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,540
That's good.

139
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,580
(Medical Room)

140
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,380
Today is the day for the new workers'
physical examination, right?

141
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
At this time,

142
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,180
they should have gathered at the hospital.

143
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,300
Alright, I'll go take a look.

144
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,540
Why are you going there?

145
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,020
This used to be handled by the hospital.

146
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,540
No need for us to make a trip.

147
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,380
True.

148
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,780
You think that pervert

149
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,740
is one of our workers?

150
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,860
Not necessarily,

151
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,540
but let's rule out the suspicion.

152
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,300
As long as we can catch him,

153
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll fully support you.

154
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,020
Wait a moment.

155
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,420
My dad brought this
from the exhibition in Hangzhou.

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,340
Whenever I got frightened as a child,

157
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
I'd have something sweet.

158
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,180
It worked wonders.

159
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,020
- Take it. It'll calm your nerves.
- Thanks.

160
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,620
Yesterday, we strolled around

161
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,060
the cafeteria with the masks on.

162
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,580
Then, I put...

163
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,380
I put it...

164
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,500
Where did I put it?

165
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,860
Who could have stolen it?

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,660
Most importantly,
if you can't find that person,

167
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,460
you'll always be the No.1 suspect.

168
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Nonsense.

169
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,940
Just because of her words,

170
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,020
am I now a pervert?

171
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,060
Come on, fill out
the physical examination form.

172
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,500
Dr. Bai,

173
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,220
isn't this for men's health?

174
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,380
Why are you here?

175
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,980
What will you check later?

176
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,940
Do we have to undress?

177
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,420
Since it's a comprehensive examination,

178
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,460
of course, you have to undress.

179
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,580
Completely undress?

180
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,580
Yes.

181
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,700
Everyone, pull your pants down
below your knees.

182
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,780
Underwear too?

183
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,020
Have you had a prostate exam?

184
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
Then let's start with you.

185
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,300
Okay.

186
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,020
Turn around.

187
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,610
Take it off.

188
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,900
Alright!

189
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,180
Keep going.

190
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,940
Come on.

191
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,220
Do it.

192
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,780
Take off your underwear too.

193
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,140
You...

194
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,060
I give up.

195
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,340
Xiaolu!

196
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,580
Be serious.

197
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,700
Why are you laughing?

198
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,500
It's your turn.

199
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,380
Got bullied by a girl?

200
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,260
Just bear with it.

201
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,580
What can you do?

202
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,660
Can you fight back?

203
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,780
I definitely can't hit a woman.

204
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,500
But if it keeps going like this,

205
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,220
I'll be too embarrassed
to stay in the factory.

206
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,100
I think this might not be a bad thing.

207
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,420
Sometimes, the harder you fall,

208
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,060
the better the chance
to turn things around.

209
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,300
Boss,

210
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,900
we've prepared everything

211
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,940
and are ready to leave at any time.

212
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,100
Where are you going now?

213
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,340
A group of thugs
from Eastern Fucheng came.

214
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
The leader is Boss Hu.

215
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,980
He used to be under me,

216
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,740
but now he's competing for the contract
of the skating rink with me.

217
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,220
Everybody knows that

218
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,140
three kilometers around the food factory
is my turf.

219
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,980
If he wants to compete for business,

220
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,140
I must crush them.

221
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,340
Why not just drive them out of Fucheng?

222
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,180
Do you need
to have a big fight with them?

223
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,460
You don't understand.

224
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,820
Subduing them is just one aspect.

225
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,460
I've already secured the skating rink.

226
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,540
You've already secured it?

227
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
I've secured the skating rink

228
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,300
and many people are envious.

229
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,620
I have to let everyone know my strength

230
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,020
and not bother me in the future.

231
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,460
This sounds exciting,

232
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,940
count me in.

233
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,660
Don't follow my footsteps in fighting.

234
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,340
Since you've entered the factory,

235
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,900
find a way to make a name for yourself.

236
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,020
This is your best opportunity.

237
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,540
If you dare do things others dare not to

238
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,260
and you can achieve something
others can't,

239
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,340
no one will dare
to bully you in the future.

240
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,980
Dajiang,

241
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,620
when should we set out?

242
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,380
Be patient.

243
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,940
I'll first arrange to meet with them
for negotiations.

244
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,180
When the time comes,

245
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,500
we'll set an ambush

246
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,100
and wipe them out.

247
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,980
Alright!

248
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,060
Boss Ma,

249
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,580
please bless me

250
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,140
to be victorious.

251
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,220
Look, I didn't know
which flavor you liked,

252
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,340
so I bought one of each for you.

253
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,030
You were also involved in this?

254
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,020
Yeah,

255
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,820
it's my goodwill gift.

256
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,940
But he paid for it.

257
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,900
Why suddenly be so nice to me?

258
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,100
What's your motive?

259
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,220
I was falsely accused
by that witch Bai Lan.

260
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,860
Did you know?

261
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,020
I know.

262
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,340
Li Guangnan told me.

263
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,980
I'm not that perverted stalker.

264
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,100
Do you believe me?

265
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,100
Of course I believe you.

266
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,260
She

267
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,180
always acts superior,

268
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,900
thinking everyone is interested in her.

269
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,020
Like everyone wants to stalk her.

270
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,820
In reality, no one cares about her.

271
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,180
I can't carry this false accusation.

272
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,580
I've thought about it.

273
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,740
As long as I catch
that perverted stalker myself,

274
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,540
I can clear my name.

275
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,780
But even the police couldn't catch him.

276
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,340
Plus, no one knows what he looks like.

277
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,180
How will you catch him?

278
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
What others can't do,

279
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,100
I, Lu Xiaolu, may be able to do it.

280
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,740
I've investigated.

281
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,500
This person always appears

282
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,660
after 7 p.m.

283
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
and frequents the area within

284
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,590
a three-kilometer radius
around the three forks.

285
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,860
He specifically stalks lone women.

286
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,620
As long as we can lure him out,

287
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,940
I don't believe I can't catch him.

288
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,540
Quick!

289
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,460
Here he comes!

290
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,460
I think I understand now.

291
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,340
You want Little Pouter to be the bait.

292
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,060
No wonder you were suddenly so attentive.

293
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,420
So you had this plan.

294
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,780
- Lu Xiaolu.
- Little Pouter.

295
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,940
I think your idea is pretty cool.

296
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,780
I'll help.

297
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,500
Really?

298
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,100
So how will you thank me?

299
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,820
I...

300
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,460
I'll cover all your soda for this summer.

301
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,020
- How about that?
- Deal.

302
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,260
Which color do you think looks better?

303
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,180
No, wait, wait.

304
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,700
Wait a minute.

305
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
I haven't agreed yet.

306
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,780
This is too dangerous.

307
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,540
Won't you two secretly protect me?

308
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,700
Yes.

309
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,980
What if the pervert
is big and carries weapons?

310
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,260
What if we can't protect you?

311
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,100
You're a man, yet so timid?

312
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,100
Anyway, Lu Xiaolu,
find someone else to do it.

313
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,020
We've only been in the factory
for a short time.

314
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,100
We barely know anyone.

315
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,540
If not Little Pouter, will you help me?

316
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,420
Maybe I can do it,
but Little Pouter can't.

317
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,060
You?

318
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,500
(Boss Hu)

319
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,500
Can you stop being so cowardly?

320
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,140
The stick is too slippery.

321
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,220
What's that?

322
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,140
Nothing.

323
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,100
My mom said

324
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,860
wearing this can bring safety.

325
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,220
Superstitious.

326
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,340
Beauty.

327
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,860
Sir, what do you want?

328
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,740
Boss, you won't like me.

329
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,580
I'm a guy.

330
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,060
Oh my...

331
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,860
You blockhead.

332
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Are you kidding me?

333
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,300
Who is it?

334
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,100
Run!

335
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,900
- Stop!
- Xiaolu?

336
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,180
What's going on?

337
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,340
Don't run.

338
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,260
Why is he here too?

339
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,900
Brothers,

340
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,380
attack now!

341
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,300
Go!

342
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,500
(Gongyuan)

343
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,780
Now this is a mess.

344
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,220
We didn't catch the pervert

345
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,100
and ruined my cousin's ambush.

346
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,980
Don't mention it.

347
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,500
I almost lost my life.

348
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,620
It's all because you were too nervous.

349
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,700
You were exposed before you even spoke.

350
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,300
It seems we need to find someone

351
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,420
with more courage.

352
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,420
Give it up. Your plan is too dangerous.

353
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,020
Only someone like Bai Lan can handle it.

354
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,740
Dangerous or not, it needs to be done.

355
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
If we can't catch the pervert,

356
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,460
I'll never be able to lift my head

357
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,300
in front of that witch.

358
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,580
But where will you find another Bai Lan?

359
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,300
Get out of the way!

360
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,540
Get out of the way!

361
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,980
The pig's gone mad!

362
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,820
Get off me!

363
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,700
You pervert!

364
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,620
I was protecting you.

365
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,140
Don't just sit there,

366
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,420
come and help!

367
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,220
Who is this?

368
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,860
She's Mr. Niu's daughter,

369
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,820
Niu Xiaoying.

370
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,780
(Niu Xiaoying)

371
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,340
So, you're that perverted Lu Xiaolu?

372
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,020
I am Lu Xiaolu,

373
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,060
but I'm not perverted.

374
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,140
On the contrary,

375
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,580
I've come to ask for your help

376
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,660
in catching that pervert.

377
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,180
Why me?

378
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,580
Because...

379
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,020
Don't say it

380
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,500
if it is because

381
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,500
I'm beautiful.

382
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,060
Tell me something new.

383
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,820
To lure out this pervert,

384
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,300
it's not only about being good-looking,

385
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,020
but also being brave enough

386
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,360
to remain calm in the face of danger.

387
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,020
Looking across the entire food factory,

388
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,460
only you can handle this important task.

389
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,500
What if I'm in danger?

390
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,660
There was also danger
when the big pig went mad.

391
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,780
But you were the bravest,

392
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,140
rushing to the front.

393
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,940
I didn't expect you
to understand me so well.

394
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,140
I'll tell you,

395
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,340
you've found the right person to do it.

396
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,020
It's settled then.

397
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,860

Why are you crying and howling

in the middle of the night?

414
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,020
Grandma,

415
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm here to protect the people from harm!

416
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,460
Will the pervert come out like this?

417
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,660
Definitely not.

418
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,580
Can we ask her to keep it down a bit?

419
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,620
Definitely not.

420
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,460
Come out!

421
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,100
Is that pervert blind?

422
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,780
I'm such a beautiful woman,

423
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,340
walking alone on the street late at night,

424
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,740
yet he could resist not coming out?

425
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,940
Miss Niu,

426
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,660
I have to say that your outfit last night

427
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,180
- was awesome.
- Right?

428
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,980
But what you did last night...

429
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,340
Wasn't it a bit...

430
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,860
A bit frightening.

431
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,900
Was it?

432
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,740
Wasn't it?

433
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,550
I did it to lure him out.

434
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,340
Then I'll change my style tomorrow.

435
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,090
I'll be Christy Chung
from "Love on Delivery",

436
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,820
or Sharla Cheung
from "Fight Back to School".

437
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,380
I'll be Sharla Cheung. She has short hair.

438
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,940
- Oh, no need, no need.
- Ah, you are it!

439
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,780
No, no need.

440
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,820
The problem is...

441
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,060
The problem is...

442
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,260
Tomorrow is the weekend.

443
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
The pervert doesn't work on weekends.

444
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,380
- He will rest.
- Exactly.

445
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,660
So, you also will have to rest.

446
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,100
Then next week.

447
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I'll be available anytime.

448
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,460
Please go back to work.

449
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,940
Thank you. Thank you.

450
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,290
Looks like,

451
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,860
we still need her to solve the problem.

452
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,020
Get off me!

453
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
You pervert!

454
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,700
Dr. Bai,

455
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,220
do you need help?

456
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,100
Did you do this?

457
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,500
When you're out in the world,

458
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,700
you're bound to get cut.

459
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,180
Although you're a female thug,

460
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,580
Fucheng is not a place
for you to act recklessly.

461
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,060
But, I'm a generous person.

462
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,900
I can forgive you.

463
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,460
I'm giving you a chance to make amends.

464
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,900
Just agree to cooperate with me

465
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,780
to find the person
who stole my face mask.

466
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,460
Not only will I fix your bike

467
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,580
and escort you home,

468
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,540
but we'll also settle

469
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,940
our past grievances.

470
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,780
You're calling black white.

471
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,660
How ridiculous.

472
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,740
You are the one calling black white!

473
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,900
You forgot your bike!

474
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,140
Are you crazy?

475
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,300
Don't you understand?

476
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,140
Cooperate with me now

477
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
while you still can.

478
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,820
You scoundrel!

479
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,100
Fix my bicycle and then

480
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,340
send it to my dorm.

481
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,380
You witch.

482
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,300
You're the female scoundrel here.

483
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,020
Who's in there?

484
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,460
Who's in there?

485
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,140
Lu Xiaolu?

486
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,420
- What?
- Why are you here so early in the morning?

487
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
Oh, nothing much.

488
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,580
Just taking a break.

489
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,340
Why does this bicycle look so familiar?

490
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,980
It's Bai Lan's.

491
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,500
Why were you sneakily
fixing her bike this morning?

492
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,580
Who was being sneaky?

493
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,140
I'm doing this openly, you know.

494
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,820
Then why cover it up with a cloth?

495
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,660
I'm afraid Mr. Niu will see and accuse me

496
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,700
of using public property
for personal matters.

497
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,180
But my question is,

498
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,980
why were you sneakily fixing

499
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,580
Bai Lan's bike?

500
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,140
It's a long story.

501
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,300
We were all naked,

502
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,100
and Dr. Bai was just looking at us.

503
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,660
I felt awkward

504
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,780
but she didn't even bat an eyelid.

505
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,900
Is that how a woman should act?

506
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,740
You know nothing.

507
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,900
Dr. Bai went to a university.

508
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,780
She's open-minded.

509
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
You can't compare her
to the female workers in our factory.

510
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,100
Those girls

511
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,260
blush at

512
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,740
the slightest joke.

513
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,420
If Dr. Bai could be my wife,

514
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,380
that'd be so great.

515
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,980
But unfortunately, she doesn't fancy us.

516
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,500
Well, you never know.

517
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,540
You can pursue her

518
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,420
and he can also do that.

519
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,940
Maybe Dr. Bai likes

520
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,700
our working-class.

521
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,740
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,660
I have

523
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,740
better chances than you.

524
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,460
She would never choose
a drunkard like you.

525
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,420
She graduated from a university

526
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,640
yet you didn't even finish high school

527
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,660
and got expelled.

528
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,220
Where's your confidence coming from?

529
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm the Chow Yun-fat of Fucheng.

530
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,900
Then I'm Andy Lau of Changle.

531
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,660
Let's make a bet.

532
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,460
Come on. What's the bet?

533
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,420
Let's bet on
who can win over Dr. Bai first.

534
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,060
How about a month's salary?

535
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,460
If I win her over...

536
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,060
Congratulations to you.

537
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,940
Get ready for the wedding.

538
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,540
Are you crazy? Why threw a rag at me?

539
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,820
That's what I wanted to do.

540
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,980
Watch your mouth,

541
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,460
or next time, it won't be a rag.

542
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,140
- Thanks.
- Have a good one.

543
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,540
(Convenience store)

544
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,980
They want to pursue Bai Lan,

545
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,500
why do you care so much?

546
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,660
I just can't stand

547
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,140
a group of men
talking about a girl like that.

548
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,300
That is Bai Lan,

549
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,060
the girl you hate the most.

550
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,580
I get it now.

551
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,060
Are you starting to like her?

552
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,860
What are you talking about?

553
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,100
After hugging her in the canteen,

554
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,140
you thought it felt good,

555
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,900
and your heart started racing,

556
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
thinking you should pursue her.

557
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,900
Nonsense.

558
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,620
How could I like her?

559
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,540
There's only hatred between us.

560
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,540
So what's going on? She likes you?

561
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,660
Li Guangnan, let me tell you.

562
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,360
Between me and Bai Lan,
it's nothing but hatred.

563
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,860
There's no love.

564
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,460
Alright, why get so worked up?

565
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,620
What I mean is,

566
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,900
if you really manage to win Bai Lan over

567
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,900
and help her escape
from those people harassing her,

568
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,860
maybe

569
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
she'll cooperate with you.

570
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,700
Not bad. Your little brain

571
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,260
sometimes comes in handy.

572
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,780
Of course.

573
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,380
(Lady Chatterley's Lover)

574
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,700
(Lady Chatterley's Lover)

575
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,220
Was the one on the loudspeaker her?

576
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,740
Yes, it's her.

577
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,220
Do you think she looks like a murderer?

578
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,900
I think she does.

579
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,420
Maybe she's carrying
several lives on her back.

580
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,260
Keep your voice down.

581
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,420
What are they doing?

582
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,180
Ignore them.

583
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,460
I'm Afang.

584
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,500
I live in the room next to yours.

585
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,140
These people

586
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,300
do nothing all day

587
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,260
but gossip about others.

588
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
You're so pretty,

589
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,820
I definitely don't believe those rumors.

590
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,100
But what if they're true?

591
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,100
Thank you,

592
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,060
but I don't mind.

593
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Hey, are you reading

594
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,540
Xu Guozhang English?

595
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,700
Yes.

596
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,460
Do you want to study abroad too?

597
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,020
Maybe.

598
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,820
Have you talked to Director Ding
at the administration office?

599
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,140
If you want to study abroad,

600
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,380
you have to go through him.

601
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,580
I've talked to him.

602
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,980
He said I could take the exam,

603
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,780
but whether I can get in depends on me.

604
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,680
I've been studying all the time,

605
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,980
but

606
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,340
they laugh at me,

607
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,150
saying I'm overestimating myself.

608
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,180
Do you need reference materials?

609
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,820
I have a lot in my dorm.

610
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,860
I can lend them to you.

611
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
Really?

612
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,820
Come on.

613
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,540
You timely mended your mistakes.

614
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,100
So you are not completely hopeless.

615
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,700
Get up, I'm leaving.

616
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,220
Wait a minute.

617
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,900
What?

618
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,020
I have something important
to discuss with you.

619
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,020
You really act like a clingy dog.

620
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,220
You're mistaken.

621
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,380
I'm not a clingy dog.

622
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,860
I'm your suspect.

623
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,260
I'm glad you know that.

624
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,620
Those workers are betting on you.

625
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,580
Can't you see it?

626
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,820
So? Do you want to join them?

627
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,420
I'll help you out.

628
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,620
You can be so kind-hearted?

629
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
I'm not doing it just to help you.

630
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,220
We can make a deal.

631
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,060
I'll help you get rid of those workers,

632
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,300
and you'll help me catch the pervert

633
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,740
and clear my name.

634
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,220
Are you threatening me?

635
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,940
Not at all.

636
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,940
It's mutually beneficial.

637
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,100
Think about it.

638
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,260
(Medical Room)

639
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,300
- Does it hurt here?
- Oh, lower, lower.

640
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,220
- Here?
- Lower, lower.

641
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,180
Lower, lower.

642
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,260
Does it hurt here?

643
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,700
Lower, lower, lower.

644
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,140
Workers in your gel workshop
bend to work every day,

645
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,820
so muscle strain is normal.

646
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,060
How did you hurt your buttocks?

647
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,900
To be honest, Dr. Bai,

648
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,420
ever since you saw my buttocks

649
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,300
during the last physical examination,

650
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,060
they haven't been feeling great.

651
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,780
You must take responsibility for it.

652
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,660
Okay, how do you want to treat it?

653
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,820
Should I give you a painkiller injection

654
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,780
or

655
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,300
perform surgery directly?

656
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,140
Dr. Bai,

657
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,700
isn't there a gentler way?

658
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,700
Oh, you lazy thing!

659
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,860
You're the number one slacker.

660
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,900
Don't move, just lie here.

661
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,700
I'll call your workshop director for you.

662
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,540
Secretary Bi,

663
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,980
please don't badmouth me.

664
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,380
I have muscle strain.

665
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,340
Is it that serious?

666
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,140
Let me arrange early retirement for you.

667
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,500
Your seniority shouldn't be
less than 30 years.

668
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,980
What retirement?

669
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,620
I received a tip-off

670
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
that workers are lining up to see you.

671
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,140
I thought something was wrong,

672
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,660
afraid you might be harassed.

673
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,380
So I came to help you out.

674
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,380
Lining up?

675
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,180
There were several more outside.

676
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,460
Don't worry,

677
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,980
I've already sent them all away.

678
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,820
Why are you helping me?

679
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,900
Since that scoundrel Lu Xiaolu

680
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
said on the loudspeaker
that you're a murderer,

681
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,420
I'm afraid these workers
won't be friendly to you.

682
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,420
I can't stand

683
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,700
bullying and oppression,

684
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,180
especially bullying the weak

685
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,700
by the strong.

686
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,260
If they all think I'm a murderer,

687
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,500
how could they dare to bully me?

688
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,140
But the key is, you're not a murderer.

689
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,540
I've seen your file.

690
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,780
I just feel you're

691
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,980
a person with a tough life.

692
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,220
- So...
- Bad news! Bad news!

693
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,300
Dr. Bai,

694
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,500
some workers got drunk at Good Cat Stall

695
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,580
and got into a fight,
and someone got injured.

696
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,820
I'll go with you.

697
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,140
Dr. Bai, let's go quickly.

698
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,060
Another fight?

699
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,660
- Let's go.
- Secretary Bi.

700
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,060
I'll send you there.

701
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,900
Can you fight?

702
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
Who's injured? Let me see.

703
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,060
- I'm injured.
- It's okay, it's okay.

704
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,140
Just a little scrape.

705
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,220
With Dr. Bai's arrival,

706
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,180
I'm already healed.

707
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,660
Dr. Bai,

708
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,300
I heard you're also from the north,

709
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,940
so we're half-fellow countrymen.

710
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,260
These are dumplings I made myself.

711
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,780
Dumplings?

712
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,500
I'm Sun Guanghui.

713
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,580
These dumplings
have shrimp and crab meat.

714
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,740
I'm Lin Weihao.

715
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,060
These are egg dumplings
made by a special chef

716
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,820
from the No. 2 Light Industry Bureau.

717
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,180
Dr. Bai, try them.

718
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,980
Sit down. Sit down.

719
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,100
Sit down.

720
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,820
Dr. Bai, these are dumplings
I made myself.

721
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,300
My dumplings
are top-notch in our factory.

722
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,260
Have a taste.

723
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,100
Dr. Bai, let me tell you...

724
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,180
Dr. Bai, have some.

725
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,420
Don't be shy.

726
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,580
Try mine. Try it.

727
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,780
Enough with the dumplings.

728
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,580
Take them back.

729
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,620
Alright, it's a shame.

730
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,380
Why did you trick me here?

731
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,580
How could we be tricking you?

732
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,820
Dr. Bai, you've been at our factory
for two months,

733
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,180
and we haven't had a chance

734
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,140
to get to know you.

735
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,620
It is a good opportunity for us

736
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,460
to sit together and get to know

737
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,540
each other today.

738
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,380
- That's right.
- Well,

739
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,300
maybe

740
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,260
it could lead to something more.

741
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,260
Exactly.

742
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,260
I think you've misunderstood.

743
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,620
Misunderstood?

744
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,660
I'm here at the factory to work,

745
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,300
not to make friends.

746
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,580
The examination I did the other day

747
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,620
might have been a bit offensive,

748
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,020
but it doesn't mean I have any interest

749
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,180
in any of you.

750
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,740
And also...

751
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,180
And also what?

752
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,620
And also,

753
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,700
she already has a boyfriend.

754
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,300
Lu Xiaolu?

755
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
What are you doing here?

756
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,340
I heard you were here to rescue someone.

757
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm here to pick you up after work.

758
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,580
These are your gifts

759
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,080
for my girlfriend, right?

760
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,220
Thanks to everyone
for looking after my girlfriend.

761
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,380
Please order anything you like.

762
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,500
Dinner is on me.

763
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,740
Lu Xiaolu,

764
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,300
stop pretending!

765
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,620
Everyone here knows that

766
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,500
you and Dr. Bai are at odds.

767
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,420
- Right.
- Exactly.

768
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,740
Her boyfriend? Ridiculous.

769
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,580
Calm down.

770
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,460
I know it's hard for you all to accept,

771
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,340
but that's the reality.

772
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,820
Darling,

773
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,820
look at my watch.

774
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,620

778
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,100
