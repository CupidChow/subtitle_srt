You're finally back.

You've been waiting for me?

28

Why are you hanging out
with Bi Zhigang again?

29
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
So what?

30
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,540
I saw you in his car.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,140
I also saw the two of you...

32
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,500
This is my private matter.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,510
It's none of your business.

34
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,620
How can you say
it's none of my business?

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,900
What about what happened between us?

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,420
Wasn't that a major life event?

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,970
What happened between us?

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,100
Do I have to take responsibility for you
for life?

39
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,180
Naive.

40
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,100
Immature.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,180
Go back and get some sleep.

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,060
Li Guangnan,

43
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,260
am I naive?

44
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,780
Both foolish and naive.

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,020
Oh, Lu Xiaolu.

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,140
You've encountered an expert.

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,860
What do you mean?

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,500
Do you know there's a type of woman

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,860
in martial arts novels

50
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,340
like

51
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,700
Madam Ma from "Demi-Gods and
Semi-Devils"

52
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,340
or Lin Xian'er
from "Legend of Dagger Lee"?

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,860
Women like them

54
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,300
are never serious

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,660
with men.

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,220
They use men as stepping stones.

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,660
Their beauty is their weapon.

58
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,380
Bai Lan isn't that kind of person.

59
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,060
Well, it seems like you don't know.

60
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,780
Bai Lan was transferred to
the Second Light Industry Bureau

61
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,780
to work as Bi Zhigang's father's translator.

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,420
I'm not making this up.

63
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,340
My mom told me.

64
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,930
It's been spreading
around the women's dormitory,

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,160
and you're the only one who doesn't know.

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,740
Well, that's good in a way.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,500
At least she doesn't have to suffer
in the boiler room.

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,660
Suffer?

69
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,060
Bi Zhigang can make Bai Lan suffer?

70
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,300
Bi Zhigang

71
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
isn't a good person,

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,940
but he indeed has a good father.

73
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,140
Oh, if I were a woman,

74
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,140
I'd go for him.

75
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,820
What I mean to say is,

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,940
if you compare yourself to Bi Zhigang,

77
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,380
he has a background, education,

78
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,340
and a good father.

79
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,580
What do you have?

80
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,220
I...

81
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,500
You do have one advantage.

82
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,500
What is it?

83
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,180
Good looks.

84
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,540
Isn't that enough?

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,580
It's usually sufficient,

86
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,060
but not for the girl you want to impress.

Director Bi,

90
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,050
he says he's very thankful
for your warm hospitality.

91
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,980
He's had a great time these past few days

92
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,380
and expresses his gratitude.

93
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,660
Okay, then tell him

94
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,340
if that's the case,

95
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,420
he shouldn't leave yet.

96
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,260
Stay a few more days.

97
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,460
Mr. Bi said, "Why don't you stay
a few more days here?

98
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,540
Don't rush to leave."

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,540
I would love to stay here,

100
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,820
but I still need to go.

101
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,340
He is thankful

102
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,820
but he has to go.

103
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,940
He needs to go back to persuade

104
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,980
his business partner to help us,

105
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,020
so he has some work to do.

106
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,260
Thank you again.

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,020
He said thank you again.

108
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,260
Okay.

109
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,420
No problem.

- Thank you sir. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

- See you soon.
- Okay.

Thank you.

113

Miss Bai, thank you.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,460
- See you.
- Thank you very much.

Miss Bai,

117
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,080
you've done a great work
these past few days.

118
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,870
I'm really a little reluctant to let you

119
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,570
go back to the food factory.

120
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,610
This is my duty.

121
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,260
Oh, this is the meeting summary

122
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,060
from yesterday with the foreign guest

123
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,300
that I organized.

124
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,380
That was fast!

125
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,020
Good, you really live up to

126
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,540
being a university graduate from Beijing.

127
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,620
If you keep working at the food factory,

128
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,840
it would be a waste of talent.

129
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,220
I hope you work hard,

130
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,460
seize opportunities,

131
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
and I see great potential ahead for you.

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,100
Thank you for your approval.

133
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,380
Well then, Director Bi,
I'll head back to the factory now.

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,360
You are going already?

135
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,900
Yes. Goodbye, Director.

136
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,380
Alright. Bye.

137
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,780
Secretary Bi,

138
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,500
what brings you here?

139
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,860
Oh, nothing.

140
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,940
Just checking in on you.

141
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,540
Are you settling in well?

142
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,660
Everything's fine.

143
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,940
Well,

144
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,980
about that night at the hotel,

145
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,860
I really didn't mean anything bad.

146
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,360
I hope you don't misunderstand.

147
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,620
I understand.

148
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,020
It must have been Lu Xiaolu
trying to cause trouble.

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,220
It was my idea.

150
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,540
It has nothing to do with him.

151
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,060
I tried so hard to persuade my dad

152
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,460
to let you come here
and be the translator.

153
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,300
Is that so?

154
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,740
But I saw the application notice

155
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,700
posted on the bulletin board
at the food factory.

156
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,580
I volunteered.

157
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,260
The Bureau selected based on merit.

158
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,340
What does it have to do with you?

159
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,900
I heard that

160
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,420
the Bureau has a fully funded slot

161
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,860
to study for a master's
in Shanghai this year.

162
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,740
There's only one slot,

163
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,180
and many people are

164
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,020
competing for it.

165
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,700
My dad said

166
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,820
they must choose the most capable person

167
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,030
to make everyone trust the result.

168
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,420
Of course,

169
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
you don't need to worry.

170
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,140
I'll do everything I can

171
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,300
to help you.

172
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,300
But it also depends on
your own capabilities.

173
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,020
I don't think I need your help.

174
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,340

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,460
What are you cooking?

190
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,720
My dad asked me to...

191
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,900
Why are you so insistent on cooking?

192
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,980
He insisted on doing it.

193
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,660
This is my job, you know.

194
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,780
Come on, give it to me.

195
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,300
Okay, good boy.

196
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,180
Hey, come back.

197
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,740
Alright,

198
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,620
keep going.

199
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,850
Dad,

200
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,740
have you heard of that strange syndrome?

201
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,860
What syndrome?

202
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,660
It is called Stockholm Syndrome.

203
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,580
I know.

204
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,820
The victim falls in love
with the perpetrator, right?

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,500
Don't you think you have this syndrome?

206
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,740
Alright, son.

207
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,220
You've grown up.

208
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,020
You know how to use sarcasm now.

209
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,740
Dad,

210
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
that's not what I meant.

211
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,340
But the truth is

212
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
since I was little,

213
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,970
you did whatever Mom asked.

214
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,670
You never fought back or argued.

215
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,900
Are you really so afraid of Mom?

216
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,100
Afraid?

217
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
You don't understand.

218
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,580
Let me tell you,

219
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,340
there's no man in this world

220
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
who's afraid of his wife.

221
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,220
This is about respect.

222
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,700
It's about love, tolerance

223
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,740
and trust.

224
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,540
Do you understand?

225
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,740
Well, let me ask you another question.

226
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,700
Go ahead.

227
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,460
If Mom gets close to

228
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,810
someone you really dislike

229
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,140
and does things you don't understand,

230
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,540
what would you do?

231
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,420
You should ask her.

232
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,260
Why are you asking me?

233
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,900
I already asked her.

234
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,380
She refused to answer

235
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,660
and claimed it had nothing to do with me.

236
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
How did you ask her?

237
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,940
Did you ask calmly

238
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,180
or assertively?

239
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,100
How can you stay calm

240
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,540
when something like that happens?

241
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,860
This matter

242
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,740
is very simple. It...

243
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,420
It sounds like
an interesting conversation.

244
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,740
What are you talking about?

245
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,780
Nothing.

246
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,660
About relationship issues?

247
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,300
No.

248
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,140
You asked your dad
about relationship issues?

249
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,780
Your dad is like a fool in that aspect.

250
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,780
What does he know?

251
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,260
You should ask me about that.

252
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,380
I'm right here.

253
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Let me tell you

254
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,140
what love is.

255
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,300
Love is all about trust.

256
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
What did you just say?

257
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,260
You questioned her?

258
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,260
How could you question her?

259
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,300
If you lose trust,

260
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,180
love will run away,

261
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
right?

262
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,540
Tell me.

263
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,060
Are you dating someone?

264
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,660
No.

265
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,580
Tell me what happened.

266
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,180
Which girl is it?

267
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,020
- Mom.
- Well...

268
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,220
Stop asking if he doesn't want to say.

269
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,740
Remember, it's only about

270
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,780
trust.

271
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,180
Look at me.

272
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,700
I trust your mom completely,

273
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,100
right?

274
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,300
Of course.

275
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,340
Trust.

276
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,060
You understand?

277
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,780
Mom, Dad just lied to you earlier.

278
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,260
He asked me to watch the stove.

279
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,460
Hey, you brat, how can you...

280
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,220
I have always done this alone.

281
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,460
That brat.

282
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,500
So stingy.

283
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,260
Hey, hey, why is she here?

284
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,700
She's a big shot at the SLI Bureau now.

285
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,300
Why did she
come to our canteen to eat today?

286
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,620
To show off of course.

287
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,380
Hey, did you hear?

288
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,940
Bai Lan is now

289
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,220
part of the Bi family.

290
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,860
She might marry Bi Zhigang this year.

291
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,660
Huh? So fast?

292
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,900
They have to. She's pregnant.

293
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,220
Dr. Bai, you don't want to eat with us?

294
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,780
She thinks we workers are dirty.

295
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,260
That's true.

296
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,260
We workers

297
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,540
have no money,

298
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,540
no power,

299
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,380
no education background.

300
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,060
We can't compare with cadres.

301
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,620
Am I right, Dr. Bai?

302
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,460
Hey, Xiaolu!

303
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,980
Watch your mouth.

304
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,220
What are you doing?

305
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,780
I dare you to say that again!

306
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,940
Hey, Xiaolu, Xiaolu.

307
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,940
Calm down, calm down.

308
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,180
Isn't she your girlfriend?

309
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,030
She dumped you,
and you are still defending her?

310
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,820
What a shame.

311
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,820
Let go of Lu Xiaolu! What are you doing?

312
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,380
What are you doing? What are you doing?

313
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
No, Xiaoying, Xiaoying.

314
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,500
- Xiaoying, Xiaoying. Enough.
- What...

315
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,140
What does it have to do with you?

316
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,500
You can't bully him

317
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,940
on my turf.

318
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
Bai Lan,

319
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,860
why are you leaving?

320
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,930
You just work there as a translator.

321
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,900
Why not explain?

322
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,620
Is explaining useful?

323
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,980
Even you thought that was true.

324
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,500
I...

325
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,180
Dr. Bai,

326
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,860
my dad said
there's a event in the afternoon

327
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,940
and he needs you to participate.

328
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,060
Got it.

329
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,420
I'll come pick you up then.

330
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,460
A toad wants to marry a white swan.

331
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,100
You're just a lowly worker.

332
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,300
Focus on your work

333
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,340
instead of daydreaming

334
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,200
and hindering others' pursuit of happiness.

335
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,500
We workers earn money honestly
with our skills.

336
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,060
What does Bi Zhigang have?

337
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,980
Just a big mouth and his dad.

338
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,020
Nothing to be proud of.

339
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,100
That's right.

340
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,380
He's just bullying people

341
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,740
with borrowed authority.

342
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,740
Big Feet,

343
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,900
I'll borrow your bike.

344
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,260
Sure.

345
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,220
What do you need it for?

346
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,500
Thanks, but don't ask.

347
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,020
Xiaolu, I'm not done yet.

348
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,460
(Gongyuan)

349
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,100
Lu Xiaolu,

350
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
are you going
to pick up Bai Lan on that bike?

351
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,660
It's really hard for you.

352
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,940
Dr. Bai,

353
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,140
I'm here to pick you up.

354
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,840
You don't have to trouble yourself.

355
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,820
It's no trouble.

356
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,020
I heard a new Western restaurant
opened in the west of town

357
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,100
with authentic flavors.

358
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,180
Let's go check it out together.

359
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,020
Bai Lan,

360
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm here to pick you up.

361
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,460
Let's go.

362
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,060
Hey, wait...

363
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
You are just...

364
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,820
But my...

365
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,340
What is the problem?

366
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
I heard Bi Zhigang say

367
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,180
he wants to take you out
for Western food.

368
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,020
It seems so.

369
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,740
I could also do that.

370
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,860
You know what?

371
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,500
There's a new place on East Street

372
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,780
- called K... KFC.
- Kentucky Fried Chicken?

373
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,620
Yeah, it's really popular.

374
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,620
The line stretches all the way

375
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,140
from East Street to the City Hall.

376
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,620
That's not Western food.

377
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
It's fast food.

378
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,540
Really?

379
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,300
Then,

380
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,820
when I get my year-end bonus,

381
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,580
I'll treat you to the most authentic
Western food in Fucheng.

382
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
How about that?

383
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,460
No need.

384
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,660
You workers earn money the hard way.

385
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,220
Didn't you say there's a place
with the best fish ball soup

386
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,060
in the world?

387
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,980
Let's go there.

388
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,340
Sure, it's settled then.

389
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,660
Mr. Niu!

390
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,660
Mr. Niu!

391
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,660
This car has been
having trouble starting lately,

392
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,500
and the left rear tire is a bit flat.

393
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,620
Can you have someone fix it?

394
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,140
That's not our responsibility.

395
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,700
You need to go
to a professional repair shop.

396
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
This is the SLI Bureau's vehicle
for foreign guests.

397
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,780
Isn't this

398
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,540
a matter for us?

399
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:38,970
No,

400
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,020
we can't handle it.

401
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,260
Where is Lu Xiaolu?

402
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
He's good at this.

403
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,660
Let him fix it.

404
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,980
Xiaolu has

405
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,700
something else to do today.

406
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,980
Really busy.

407
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,220
Well, I'm telling you...

408
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,420
He's really busy.

409
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
You...

410
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,620
How about this? I can fix the battery.

411
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
I'll do it.

412
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,500
Stop!

413
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,460
Today, only Lu Xiaolu

414
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,260
is allowed to fix this car.

415
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,980
- Xiaolu is...
- Alright.

416
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,900
I'll fix it.

417
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,380
Xiaolu.

418
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,420
Master,

419
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,540
leave it to me.

420
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,140
Tell me about the problem.

421
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,980
Check this tire first.

422
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,300
Let me tell you,

423
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,980
be careful.

424
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,340
This is a high-end vehicle,

425
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,620
all imported.

426
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,830
If you mess it up, I doubt
you can afford to pay for it.

427
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,140
High-end

428
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,620
but useless trash.

429
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,020
My bike's wheels work better than this.

430
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,980
Lu Xiaolu,

431
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,740
I forgive you
for your ignorant remarks just now.

432
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,500
After all, with your background,

433
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,660
you probably haven't had much exposure
to imported cars,

434
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,220
and

435
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,420
for someone like you,

436
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,960
even if you spend your whole life
fixing things in this factory,

437
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,860
you probably can't even afford this tire.

438
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,700
Bi Zhigang,

439
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,820
- watch your words.
- That's right.

440
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,900
What do you mean by that?

441
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,820
Do you look down on us repair workers?

442
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,060
What are you guys doing?

443
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,340
This is between him and me.

444
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,700
None of your business.

445
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,740
Get back to work!

446
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,660
Lu Xiaolu,

447
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,340
I'm warning you,

448
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,500
stop showing up in front of Bai Lan.

449
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,700
Sometimes people are like cars,

450
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,500
some are imported, some are domestic,

451
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,260
and some are just a mishmash of junk.

452
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,780
You're right.

453
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,220
People, like cars,
come in different varieties,

454
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,860
but it's not about money;

455
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,780
it's about whether your heart is clean.

456
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,940
Don't think you're special just because

457
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,310
your dad is a director.

458
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,700
I'm telling you,

459
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,100
in my eyes,

460
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
besides putting on airs

461
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,620
- What are you doing?
- and faking it,

462
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,260
you're nothing.

463
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,700
I'll...

464
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,360
- What are you doing?
- Did you forget who you are?

465
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,460
You want a fight?

466
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,740
Let me tell you,

467
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,380
no matter whose son you are,

468
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,700
during work hours,

469
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,840
you can't mess around in my repair shop.

470
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,270
You think you can
just do whatever you want

471
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,100
because you're a cadre?

472
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,940
Exactly!

473
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,780
Alright, you guys.

474
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
You've got a lot of people

475
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,460
and you're ganging up on me, huh?

476
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,980
Hey, don't say we're ganging up on you.

477
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,580
You can also find people to back you up.

478
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,940
We'll have a fair fight

479
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,420
and see who's the coward.

480
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,820
Alright, let's fight!

481
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,140
I have plenty of friends,

482
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,980
and let me tell you,

483
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
you can't afford to offend them.

484
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,180
You mean those sons of cadres

485
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,300
from your big yard?

486
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,340
- Bring them on!
- I'll...

487
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,140
I'll teach them a serious lesson.

488
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,860
- Okay, alright.
- Just go!

489
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,140
Remember what you said.

490
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,660
This matter is not over!

491
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,900
Not over!

492
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,500
Hey, Xiaolu is here.

493
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,060
Xiaolu, we've heard about it.

494
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,140
Heard about what?

495
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,180
Your repair team
will have a fight with Bi Zhigang.

496
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,620
It spread so quickly.

497
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,780
I heard that guy was

498
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,060
scared out of his wits.

499
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,300
Good job!

500
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,900
Bi Zhigang has been doing bad deeds,

501
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,380
we've all had enough of him.

502
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,700
You stood up for us workers,

503
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,460
and we won't forget it.

504
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,620
If you need anything,

505
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,500
just let us know.

506
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,940
- Exactly!
- Yes!

507
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I apologize for last time.

508
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,620
I was wrong.

509
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,340
We thought you were teaming up with them

510
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,540
because of Bai Lan.

511
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,180
It was all a misunderstanding.

512
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,860
I told you Xiaolu wasn't like that.

513
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,340
Get out of the way!

514
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,260
These are all for you.

515
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,020
You think I'm a pig?

516
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,660
These are your favorites.

517
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,620
Oh, right.

518
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,060
Delicious.

519
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,220
Take them.

520
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,100
You need to be full to have strength.

521
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,780
These are your favorites.

522
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,300
She's not only good at cooking

523
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,540
but also fighting.

524
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,540
What a special girl.

525
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,220
She is really one of a kind.

526
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,140
Lu Xiaolu and the repair team

527
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,580
are a bunch of barbarians.

528
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,180
Why would you fight with them?

529
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,620
Secretary Bi!

530
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,860
Don't drop the ball tomorrow.

531
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,820
We're all waiting for you to get beaten up
by the repair team.

532
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,460
- What are you saying?
- Hey, Secretary Bi.

533
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,620
- Say that again!
- Secretary Bi, please.

534
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,820
Don't leave, don't go!

535
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,460
Did you see that?

536
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,220
I didn't want to fight,

537
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,380
they forced me into it.

538
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,580
But can you really win against them?

539
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,020
- I...
- Those are just rough people.

540
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,340
I just can't swallow this.

541
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,620
Even if I can't win,

542
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,540
I have to fight.

543
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,020
Secretary Bi,

544
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,780
if you don't want to fight,

545
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,860
I can

546
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,540
find a way to resolve this.

547
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,050
- You?
- But

548
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,020
since the incident with Afang last time,

549
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,780
I've been feeling mistreated

550
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,940
and I haven't been valued at all.

551
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,860
I mean...

552
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,580
- Fighting is uncivilized after all.
- That's right.

553
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,140
If you can calm this trouble,

554
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,630
it'll make up for your previous actions.

555
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,700
I'll definitely speak to my father

556
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,700
on your behalf.

557
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,140
I'll do my best.

558
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,980
Children fighting is normal.

559
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,740
Why do you care?

560
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,860
How can this be children fighting?

561
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,080
He's fighting against the only son

562
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,060
of Deputy Director Bi of the SLI Bureau.

563
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,180
It doesn't matter whose son he is.

564
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,640
He'll get beaten up if he deserves it.

565
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,500
You...

566
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,020
Your cousin is too young to know better,

567
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
but you, as his older cousin,

568
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,220
shouldn't act like him.

569
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,820
Let me tell you, this fight can't happen.

570
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,400
If it does, it'll affect your skating rink.

571
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,460
You don't understand?

572
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,700
Secretary Hong has always been

573
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,020
dissatisfied with your use

574
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,900
of factory land for the skating rink.

575
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,700
Now that he's the factory director,

576
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,140
if his higher-up's son gets beaten up...

577
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,420
Think about it.

578
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,780
Do you still want the skating rink?

579
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,620
Alright,

580
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,940
Ding,

581
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,980
I'll handle this.

582
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,700
Don't take it lightly.

583
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,580
Talk to him nicely.

584
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,060
- I have to go.
- Okay.

585
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,300
Easy.

586
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Each of us

587
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,980
- will wield a stick like this.
- Let me see.

588
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,220
Bi and his friends

589
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,540
will be in serious trouble.

590
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,700
No sticks.

591
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,530
My cousin said we should not

592
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,700
go all out in a fight.

593
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,900
It's a hidden rule.

594
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,220
We're all from the same factory.

595
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,540
What if someone gets seriously hurt?

596
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,780
Blind weapons can cause accidents.

597
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,660
But just now...

598
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,820
I think you're right.

599
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,300
Me too.

600
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,300
I think

601
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,180
we can do that this weekend.

602
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,740
We should settle this
sooner rather than later

603
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,020
to prevent further complications.

604
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Sure, whatever.

605
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,180
You seem to understand brawling
pretty well.

606
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,260
- Bro.
- Dajiang.

607
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,580
Why are you here?

608
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,540
I have so many good qualities,

609
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,820
why only learn

610
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,460
how to fight like me?

611
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,020
It's not like that.

612
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,380
For the sake of a woman,

613
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,660
you're arranging fights now,

614
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,380
causing a huge commotion.

615
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,140
You've really grown up.

616
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,100
- Dajiang...
- Dajiang,

617
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,620
it's not about a woman.

618
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,260
Bi Zhigang has gone too far.

619
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,420
He looks down on us workers,

620
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,100
and we can't stand for it.

621
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,260
It's true!

622
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,940
- He's right.
- It's true!

623
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,060
That's why

624
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,300
I've brought my brothers here.

625
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,100
Let's see who dares to touch my cousin.

626
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,420
Let's go!

627
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,660
- Thank you, Dajiang!
- Thanks!

628
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,340
- Let's go.
- Dajiang is great!

629
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,620
Xiaolu.

630
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,940
Why are you here?

631
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,340
Director Bi asked me
to check if the car was fixed.

632
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,380
The foreign guests are waiting.

633
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,440
There was just a minor issue

634
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,440
with the battery connection,

635
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,340
but it's fixed now.

636
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm asking you,

637
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
did you arrange to fight with Bi Zhigang?

638
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Even you know about it?

639
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,460
But strictly speaking, this isn't just a fight.

640
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,220
It's a battle for justice.

641
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,620
That's still a fight.

642
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,260
Anyway, no matter what,

643
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
you must come

644
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,500
and see

645
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,260
how I knock Bi Zhigang down.

646
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,780
I won't come.

647
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,030
Why?

648
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,580
Anyway, I'm telling you,

649
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,100
if you fight,

650
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
I won't talk to you anymore.

651
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Hey, have you ever learned to drive?

652
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,540
That way!

653
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,780
Why can't you
solve problems with your brain?

654
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,100
Resorting to violence

655
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,220
is something barbarians do.

656
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,340
Whatever you say.

657
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,460
Just consider me a barbarian.

658
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,140
I can't back out at this point.

659
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,580
- You must fight?
- Yes.

660
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,100
Foolish!

661
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,980
Selfish!

662
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,620
Vain!

663
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,940
You narcissistic men,

664
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,140
am I some kind of object?

665
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,940
Whoever wins gets me as a prize?

666
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,260
Your competition with Bi Zhigang

667
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
is utterly absurd from start to finish.

668
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,180
It's not like that, Bai Lan.

669
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
I don't mean that.

670
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,980
Bi Zhigang is really up to no good.

671
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,980
Not only does he look down on us workers,
but he deliberately placed you in the SLI Bureau

672
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
just to take advantage of you.

673
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,930
I voluntarily went
to the Second Light Industry Bureau.

674
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,340
I like English, I like translation.

675
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,180
I don't like the boiler room.
What business is it of yours?

676
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,540
Get off!

677
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,860
Get off!

678
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
When I sent it for repair,

679
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,580
it just had a minor issue with starting.

680
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,060
How did it end up like this

681
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,180
when it came back?

682
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,930
This is the car for hosting foreign guests.

683
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,020
It's very delicate.

684
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,340
Director, I'm sorry.

685
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,380
It was my carelessness.

686
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,180
Please give me some more time.

687
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,420
I'll find a way to fix this.

688
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,740
Bai Lan,

689
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,260
normally you seem

690
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
quiet and composed.

691
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,940
I always feel you are reliable.

692
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,100
Listen,

693
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,140
you can't be the type of girl

694
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,580
who treats everything lightly

695
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,740
and does things recklessly.

696
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,500
- I...
- Listen,

697
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,860
I'll put the issue of the training quota

698
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,420
on hold for now.

699
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,740
I think you need to go back to the factory

700
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,100
and gain some experience.

701
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,830
I want to see how you perform.

702
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,460
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard)

703
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,340
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard
Get a stretcher ready)

704
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,740
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard)

705
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,490
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard
Get a stretcher ready)

706
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,140
Get a stretcher ready.

707
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,580
♪Life fools me♪

708
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,460
♪Deceives me♪

709
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
♪Troubles me♪

710
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,460
Enough, Big Feet, stop singing

711
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,420
and start training seriously.

712
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,540
We are going to fight,

713
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,500
not sing.

714
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,820
Xiaolu,

715
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,140
I'm not going to train.

716
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,140
It's too late anyway.

717
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,220
Maybe I can cheer you guys.

718
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm not going.

719
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,340
If you dare to back down,

720
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,250
- I'll hit you right now. Do you understand?
- What are you doing?

721
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,740
Stop, come here.

722
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,340
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

723
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,860
Xiaolu, you can't fight this battle.

724
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,700
You can't win.

725
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,260
Who sent you as a mediator?

726
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,180
Even if you fight, you won't win.

727
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,500
What do you mean?

728
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,940
The battle hasn't even started yet.

729
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,980
How can you

730
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,060
deflate our morale?

731
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,700
When I was
delivering files in the office,

732
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,580
I overheard Bi Zhigang

733
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,060
making a phone call to the police.

734
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,660
- The police?
- Yes.

735
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,540
I eavesdropped on him.

736
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,020
He told the police that the workers

737
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,490
were going to bring weapons
to start a fight.

738
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,260
He wanted the police to arrest all of you.

739
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,060
How can that jerk play dirty like this?

740
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,780
The more he does this,

741
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,660
the less we can back down.

742
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,780
Do you all want to get caught?

743
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,220
It's okay.

744
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,620
Let's change the location later

745
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,530
and have our brothers
keep an eye on Bi's people.

746
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,220
We won't let them leak information.

747
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,620
Yes, our factory people

748
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,860
can help us keep an eye on Bi's people.

749
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,260
Are you guys crazy?

750
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,460
Don't worry, Little Pouter.

751
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,780
The fight between men

752
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,720
is about facing challenges
and never backing down.

753
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,020
Well said.

754
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,540
Then did you know the SLI Bureau
fired Bai Lan?

755
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,460
She's starting to work
in the boiler room today.

756
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,060
- Really?
- I saw the notice

757
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,540
in the office with my own eyes.

758
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,940
And have you considered

759
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,980
why she was demoted?

760
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Everyone in the factory knows

761
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,300
who you are fighting for.

762
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Do you think the leadership doesn't know?

763
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,820
You still have time to call it off now.

764
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,540
If you really fight and cause some result,
Bai Lan won't escape unscathed.

765
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,940
Enough. Stop it.

766
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,900
Oh, stop.

767
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,740
This is not your first time here.

768
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,660
You don't need me
to teach you again, right?

769
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,700
You need more practice.

770
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,020
She's pretty good at it already.

771
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,100
Quickly.

772
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,020
- Let's take a break.
- Take a break.

773
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,640
Have you heard this old saying?

774
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,860
It's said that the higher

775
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,460
a person climbs,

776
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,980
the harder they may fall.

777
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,980
Oh, Doctor Bai,

778
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,500
you must understand
this principle too, right?

779
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,540
It's not easy at the top, right?

780
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,220
Practice more.

781
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,260
Tired already?

782
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
Hurry up
or you can't finish it even tomorrow.

783
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,900
Hurry up. Come on.

784
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,220
What are you waiting for?

785
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,220
Staring at me won't help you.

786
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,700
Move!

787
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,000
The battle is happening on Sunday.

788
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,340
Are you so excited that you can't sleep?

789
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
I feel the same way.

790
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,780
Should I

791
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,180
play the guitar for you

792
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,940
to calm you down?

793
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,300
♪Should I give up, admit defeat?♪

794
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,140
Stop!

795
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,660
The battle between experts

796
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,740
are more about mental state.

797
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,940
Don't disturb Xiaolu.

798
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,660
Got it.

799
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,380
♪Should♪

800
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,220

I'll stop singing.

804
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,060
Ding Dezhong! I'm telling you!

805
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,140
I will definitely leave the boiler room!

806
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,900
You narcissistic men,

807
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,660
am I some kind of object?

808
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,980
Whoever wins gets me as a prize?

809
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,740
I like English, I like translation.

810
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,220
I voluntarily went to the SLI Bureau.

811
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,180
What business is it of yours?

812
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,660
Dajiang,

813
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,180
no matter what happens today,

814
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,340
don't start fighting

815
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,540
without my permission.

816
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,580
Promise me.

817
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,380
Did you hear the news?

818
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,900
Lu Xiaolu is having a showdown

819
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,460
with Bi Zhigang this morning.

820
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,060
Is it true?

821
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,500
Who do you think will win?

822
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,580
It's definitely Lu Xiaolu.

823
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,700
Bi Zhigang is so frail

824
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,800
that I could push him over easily.

825
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,420
Well, you never know.

826
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,940
He's also a man.

827
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,180
You can't say that.

828
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,820
Although Bi Zhigang is...

829
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,060
The fight is about to start!

830
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,100
Let's go watch.

831
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,040
- Let's go.
- Come on.

832
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,300
Who are you betting on to win?

833
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,220
This whole thing today

834
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
started because of my

835
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,580
personal grievances with Bi Zhigang.

836
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,420
To avoid dragging down others,

837
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,220
I propose settling it

838
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,740
with a one-on-one.

839
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,780
- One-on-one?
- Xiaolu.

840
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,280
- You don't have to do this.
- Xiaolu.

841
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,260
You don't have to say that.

842
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,280
We're not afraid of him! Hit him!

843
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,540
Quiet!

844
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,820
No need for a one-on-one.

845
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,260
Today's fight

846
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,300
is between Lu Xiaolu and Bi Zhigang.

847
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,140
Since this is their decision,

848
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,020
no one should object.

849
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,790
Let me make one thing clear beforehand.

850
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,180
During their one-on-one,

851
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,430
no one is allowed to intervene.

852
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,220
Whoever breaks this rule,

853
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,020
I won't approve it.

854
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Understood?

855
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,020
Understood.

856
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,260
Okay.

857
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,820
Debao.

858
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,060
Debao.

859
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,420
Xiaolu!

860
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
- Is he okay?
- He's bleeding.

861
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,140
He went all out!

862
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,180
Xiaolu! Xiaolu!

863
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,620
Xiaolu, fight back, Xiaolu!

864
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,060
Fight back, Xiaolu!

865
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,980
Get up!

866
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
You big mouth!

867
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,980
That's too much!

868
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,100
- Get out of the way!
- Get up and keep fighting!

869
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,220
Stop fighting!

870
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,260
Why are you here?

871
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,820
Xiaolu.

872
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,020
Let me see.

873
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,220
He brought this upon himself.

874
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,260
It's not my fault.

875
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,530
Get lost!

876
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,940
Clearly, I won.

877
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,380
If anyone should get lost, it's you all.

878
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,100
Why should I get lost?

879
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,540
Get lost!

880
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,580
Why should I listen to you?

881
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,780
Why not?

882
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,180
Fine.

883
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,460
Alright.

884
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,060
Take care of your injuries.

885
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,860
This feels so good!

886
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,820
Get lost now!

887
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,900
- Get lost!
- Xiaolu!

888
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,140
Xiaolu!

889
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,460
- Xiaolu, Xiaolu!
- Xiaolu, Xiaolu!

890
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,540
You guys...

891
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,980
You guys...

892
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,460
You're not allowed to bully Bai Lan.

893
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,340
Xiaolu.

894
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,660
You are awake.

895
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,780
Young lady,

896
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,660
why are you crying?

897
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,060
What did you call me?

898
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,940
Young lady.

899
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,740
What's wrong?

900
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,420
Don't you recognize me?

901
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,060
You seem quite familiar.

902
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,780
You wouldn't happen to be

903
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,420
my dream lover, would you?

904
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,260
It hurts here?

905
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,020
Let me take a look.

906
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,620
Here?

907
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,820
It's probably a rib issue.

908
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,300
A rib issue?

909
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,300
Don't lie to me.

910
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,420
I know if I

911
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,940
have a rib issue.

912
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,580
Let me tell you,

913
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,660
it doesn't hurt at all.

914
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,140
It was nothing at all.

915
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,900
Does it hurt or not?

916
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,620
Okay,

917
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,260
let's go to the hospital.

918
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,340
I'll take you to get an X-ray.

919
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,500
Didn't you say I had a rib problem?

920
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,740
I can't walk anymore.

921
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,220
If we need to go,

922
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,380
then carry me there.

923
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
I'll help you walk.

924
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,500
Get up.

925
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,660
Slowly sit up.

926
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,940
Why are you so mean?

927
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,700
You won't even carry me.

928
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,980
Just helping you walk

929
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,420
is already overflowing
with humanitarianism.

930
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,260
Be good.

931
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,620
I read in a book that

932
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,180
women are men's ribs.

933
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,460
When you hit my ribs just now,

934
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,580
