Mr. Huang is busy right now.

He can't talk to you.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,260
I've promised you

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,420
I'll stop their collaboration.

since you've already

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,180
there's no need
for your involvement anymore.

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,580
Also,

36
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,300
you're not qualified to

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,060

I must see Huang Qing today.

41
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,100
If you don't explain

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,140

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,540

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,180
Here, Master.

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,380
Sharpen it some further.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,660

52

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,580
Alright.

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,580
Master,

55
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,020
are we really going to confront them?

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,140
They're a bunch of desperados.

57
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,260
If our people don't have weapons

58
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,900
when they come back,

59
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,300
we will be at a disadvantage.

60
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,540
Master, it's raining.

61
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,460
Those jerks won't come back, right?

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,100
It's good to be cautious.

63
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,900
Oh, by the way,

64
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,980
I asked you two

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,620
to secure the peacock statue

66
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,460
at the factory gate. Did you do it?

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,700
I went up to check.

68
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,180
There's a big crack up there

69
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,140
that would need a lot of
steel wire to secure it.

70
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,580
But...

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,420
But what?

72
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,420
But we don't have
any steel wire right now.

73
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,700
We need to buy some new ones.

74
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,820
I went to logistics
that day to ask them for it,

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,860
but they said

76
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,140
the factory is in chaos these days

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,020
and they've frozen the accounts,
so there's no money for us.

78
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,860
So you just gave up?

79
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,700
I...

80
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,740
Even if you tied it up with ropes,

81
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,940
it would be a lot safer.

82
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,060
Do you know that thing

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
could hurt someone if it falls down?

84
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,980
- I...
- Master Niu.

85
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,700
Why are you here?

86
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,260
I heard someone's coming
to tear down our factory.

87
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,100
Master Niu,

88
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,660
even if we die today,

89
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,500
we must fight these jerks to the end.

90
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,980
Yes, fight to the end.

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,220

♪Mirage is all over the heart♪

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,260
If there's no money, I'll find a way.

189
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,660
Everything will be okay.

190
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,500
Bai Lan, have you ever thought about it?

191
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,500
The Golden Peacock's factory buildings,

192
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,580
dormitories,

193
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,180
chimneys,

194
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,690
and maintenance workshop

195
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,940
will all disappear completely

196
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,020
in the near future.

197
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,340
I remember when I was little,

198
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,260
I thought everything
in the food factory was eternal

199
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,340
and unchanging.

200
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,540
I thought it would accompany me
throughout my life.

201
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,100
I even had a dream.

202
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,980
I was really old in it,

203
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,620
but when I walked into the medical room,

204
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,420
I found you still treating patients.

205
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,140
Was I old too?

206
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,020
No, you were not.

207
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,300
You still looked young,

208
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,620
just like when I first met you.

209
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,580
You were there for treatment too?

210
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,220
I just wanted to get closer to you.

211
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,900
I had so many things

212
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,780
to say to you.

213
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,540
It's just a dream
that will never come true.

214
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,940
(Gongyuan)
Due to the accident occurred in our factory,

215
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,900
the City Party Committee
and Government require

216
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,740
an immediate halt to all

217
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,920
resumption of work activities,

218
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,120
pending investigation
by the accident investigation team.

219
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,140
In addition, according to
the directives of the government,

220
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,940
as our factory no longer possesses

221
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,620
the basic conditions for normal production,

222
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,460
in order to maintain

223
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,100
the stability and unity of our factory,

224
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,540
please promptly carry out

225
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,540
the democratic voting process
among all employees

226
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,030
(Not Sell, Abstain, Sell)
to decide whether to proceed with

227
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,740
the overall transfer of our factory
to Shanghai Huaxing Corporation.

228
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,620
The vote is coming soon.

229
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,140
Could it be that
we really can't save this factory?

230
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:11,060
(Gongyuan)

231
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,540
Mayor Bi,

232
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,030
is the investigation proceeding smoothly?

233
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,340
If the accident is ultimately

234
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,740
attributed to equipment failure,

235
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,580
as the responsible person
for restructuring the food factory,

236
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,980
you can't

237
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,380
avoid implication.

238
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,180
Therefore,

239
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,700
you must compensate the injured girl.

240
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,700
As long as we can secure the land,

241
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,340
money is not an issue.

242
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,620
However, this accident

243
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,380
has indeed
been quite advantageous for us,

244
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,340
as it has made the workers

245
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,300
more aware of reality.

246
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,060
Meanwhile,

247
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,340
the city is considering

248
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,980
resolving the food factory issue

249
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,780
as soon and thoroughly as possible.

250
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,340
Think about it,

251
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,540
who would want to hold onto

252
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,980
such an unlucky and unpromising factory?

253
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,500
I won't delay the matters

254
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,820
I promised you.

255
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,940
Dajiang.

256
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,100
Hey, you're back.

257
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,260
I'm planning to take a trip to Thailand
with Tao.

258
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,180
Ms. Tao told me about it.

259
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,060
That's great!

260
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,820
If you like it there,

261
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,420
just stay a bit longer

262
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,030
and don't keep
thinking about coming back.

263
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,900
Don't miss me too much.

264
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,940
If you run into trouble,

265
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,340
don't hide it from me.

266
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,900
Dajiang,

267
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,780
what trouble could I have?

268
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,700
How's your friend
Li Guangnan doing lately?

269
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,260
I heard his wife got injured.

270
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,660
I don't know.

271
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,640
I looked for him all afternoon
but couldn't find him.

272
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,020
Fucheng isn't that big.

273
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,060
Where could he go?

274
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,860
Juan, you're awake.

275
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,620
Bai Lan went to get your medicine.

276
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,540
I saw no one in the room,

277
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,780
so I came in to check on you.

278
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,100
Are you thirsty?

279
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,220
I know you don't want to talk to me now.

280
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,340
You probably hate me,

281
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,540
but this is all my fault.

282
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,180
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

283
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,020
Just focus on recovering.

284
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,580
- The other things...
- Let's get a divorce.

285
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,420
Okay.

286
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,900
When your legs heal,
we'll go through with it.

287
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,300
Juan,

288
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,740
if we can't be husband and wife anymore,

289
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,140
can we still be friends?

290
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:22,260
(Dajiang Entertainment City)

291
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,460
(Skate Land)

292
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,780
There you are.

293
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,940
Xiaolu, you're here.

294
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,060
Come take a look

295
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,940
at our skating rink.

296
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,940
Xiaolu,

297
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
remember how good it was

298
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,580
when we were here at the skating rink?

299
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,860
We had no sorrows

300
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,100
and our love was so pure.

301
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,860
It was right there.

302
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,420
I fought with you

303
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,940
for Little Pouter.

304
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,300
She kept saying she liked you,

305
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,820
but she didn't actually like you,

306
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,260
she liked me, right?

307
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,340
Yes,

308
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,620
she liked you.

309
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,500
Your dream came true.

310
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,020
But what are you doing now?

311
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,900
Li Guangnan,

312
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,140
tell me what you should be doing!

313
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,860
You have no right to be sad here.

314
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,220
Let me tell you,

315
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,100
you should be at the hospital.

316
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,500
You should be by Little Pouter's side.

317
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I won't go.

318
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,060
- You won't go, huh?
- I won't go.

319
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,140
I will never be there.

320
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,400
You want to die, huh?

321
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,460
Move!

322
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,540
Come on!

323
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,140
I won't go.

324
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,140
Walk!

325
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,500
You want to die?

326
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,460
Do you still want to die?

327
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,460
Tell me!

328
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,340
Look at me!

329
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
Speak!

330
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,740
Help!

331
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,900
Staying in the hospital
doesn't make much sense now.

332
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,740
I suggest

333
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,860
she goes through
the discharge procedures.

334
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,460
In her current condition,

335
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,660
given the limitations
of medical technology,

336
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,780
successful treatments are extremely rare.

337
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,980
Is it a work-related injury?

338
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,030
Then you can seek reimbursement
from the employer.

339
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,940
Which company are you with?

340
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,020
Golden Peacock Food Factory.

341
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,260
Then go talk to the factory leadership

342
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,260
and let them pay the money.

343
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,060
If the factory refuses to pay,

344
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,560
then you should make a scene.

345
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,980
There are many methods you can try.

346
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,820
At times like this,
don't worry about dignity.

347
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
From my experience,

348
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,540
those leaders are all afraid of trouble.

349
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,620
The money won't come
from their pockets anyway.

350
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,900
Thank you, doctor.

351
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,460
Do you remember that year

352
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,460
we both missed the college entrance exam?

353
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
The whole summer,

354
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,940
you rode that old bike

355
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,300
and took me around everywhere.

356
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,300
Back then, I felt like

357
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,060
my whole life was over.

358
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,700
Of course I remember that.

359
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
That bike was my

360
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,500
18th birthday gift.

361
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,880
And I rode it into a ditch because of you.

362
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,780
My mom scolded me for a long time.

363
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,180
Looking back now,
you should really thank me.

364
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,260
If it weren't for that bike breaking down,

365
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,030
it wouldn't have been used
for experiments for Big Feet.

366
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,500
It was the first

367
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,180
motorcycle bike in the factory.

368
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,100
Afterward,

369
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,060
we used the first money we earned
from selling milk tea

370
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,660
to buy a real motorcycle.

371
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,220
After that,

372
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,420
we each had our own car.

373
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,100
But Li Guangnan,
have you ever thought about it?

374
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,660
As we earn more money

375
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,340
and upgrade our cars,

376
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,580
we become less happy.

377
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,620
Do you remember what you said to me

378
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,700
when I came back from Shanghai,

379
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,100
and was at the lowest point in my life?

380
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,340
Those days taught me a lesson.

381
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,420
Even in the darkest times,

382
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,940
there's a day to come out.

383
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,820
As long as you want,

384
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,420
everything can start anew.

385
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,180
I know what to do now.

386
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,220
Juan,

387
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,500
the doctor said

388
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,580
you need to move your legs more

389
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,180
to keep the muscles

390
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,420
from atrophying.

391
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,940
So from now on,

392
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,140
before the caregiver arrives,

393
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,780
I'll massage your legs every day.

394
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,380
Don't waste time.

395
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,500
Why is it a waste of time?

396
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,020
As long as
we persist like this every day,

397
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,340
you'll be able to walk soon.

398
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,420
It's no use!

399
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,620
I can't feel them at all!

400
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,460
Juan!

401
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Not at all!

402
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,300
Juan!

403
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,100
Don't you believe me?

404
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,020
You're not a doctor anymore!

405
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,420
But I'm your doctor.

406
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,580
Whatever difficulties you face,

407
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,940
I'm on your side.

408
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,540
I can take care of you
in the future if needed.

409
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,820
Thank you.

410
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,300
Why don't you rest for a while?

411
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,660
I'll rest too.

Miss Bai,

00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,380
Hello?

430
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,220
Mr. Huang.

431
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,420
I heard you're leaving Fucheng.

432
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,420
I've taken care of everything for you.

433
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,720
Yet you're leaving
without even telling me?

434
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,220
You are quite well-informed.

435
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,260
Of course,

436
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
so I'm calling to remind you

437
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,540
not to end up like Vice Mayor Bi.

438
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,900
Otherwise, you'd be in trouble.

439
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,460
Is that so?

440
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,460
I've done so much for you,

441
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,900
and you're leaving like this?

442
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,260
Come on.

443
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,620
I didn't get anything I wanted.

444
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,940
How can I give you what you want?

445
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,300
Mr. Huang,

446
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,700
you're a shrewd businessman,

447
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,100
and I knew

448
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
you wouldn't just pay so easily.

449
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,940
That's why

450
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,580
your woman is here with me.

451
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,540
You're extorting me?

452
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,260
After all the collaboration,

453
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,820
you know what I'm capable of.

454
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,340
Don't waste our time.

455
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,820
I'm waiting for you.

456
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,740
Lyu, prepare the car.

457
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,580
We're going to the airport.

458
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,220
Are you delivering the money to me?

459
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,540
Mr. Huang,

460
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,780
you're willing to

461
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,860
abandon your own woman just to escape?

sheltering organized crime,)

00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,860
(illegally accepting property from others,)

465
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,550
(resulting in significant losses
to the interests)

466
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,060
(of the state and the people.)

467
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,700
(The Fucheng People's Procuratorate)

468
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,120
(has lawfully issued an arrest warrant
against Bi Shanwen)

469
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,940
(and brought charges including sheltering)

470
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,480
(organized crime, and bribery.)

471

472
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,350
(under the shelter of Bi Shanwen,)

473
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,540
(organized and led
an organized crime group,)

474
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,830
(committing offenses such as)

475
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,780
(intentional murder, intentional injury,)

476
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,010

and forced transactions.)

(Huang Qing has been lawfully arrested)

478
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,230
(and charged with offenses
including organizing and leading)

479
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,290
(an organized crime group
and intentional murder.)

480
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,980
- Let go of me!
- Move!

481
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,660
Bai Lan?

482
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,540
Is it that I'm getting old?

483
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,780
That's impossible.

484
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,380
You just became more mature.

485
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
The charm of a mature man.

486
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,700
Just stop. I can pack my stuff myself.

487
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,500
How can I stop?

488
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,780
I have to watch you
getting in Ms. Tao's car.

489
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,440
That's the only way I can be reassured.

490
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,620
Let me do it.

491
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,740
Dajiang,

492
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
you and Ms. Tao

493
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,820
can finally leave this place

494
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,380
and live a carefree life.

495
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,300
I'm genuinely happy for you.

496
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,220
In the future, you and your girl

497
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
will also have such good days.

498
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,540
Hello?

499
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,940
Bai Lan has been kidnapped.

500
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,180
What are you saying?

501
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,620
I've been looking for Boss Hu
these past two days.

502
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,260
I wanted revenge for Little Pouter.

503
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,180
I just found him,

504
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,500
and guess what? I saw Bai Lan.

505
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,860
Where are you?

506
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,860
I'm at the East Suburb warehouse.

507
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,060
There's a blue truck at the entrance.

508
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,100
Wait for me.

509
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,300
Don't act alone.

510
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Okay.

511
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,540
Xiaolu.

512
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,340
What's wrong?

513
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
Nothing.

514
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,140
Li Guangnan

515
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,020
is feeling down,

516
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,340
and wants me to console him.

517
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,140
Hey, Dajiang,

518
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
are you leaving for the dock?

519
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,180
Tao is about to come pick me up.

520
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,940
Okay, then I won't see you off.

521
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,420
When I'm done with this busy period,

522
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,460
I'll come visit you in Thailand.

523
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,340
Make sure to bring her with you.

524
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,940
- Take care, Dajiang.
- Go ahead.

525
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,340
Let's go.

526
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,620
I'm a bit worried about Xiaolu.

527
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,700
He just got a call from Li Guangnan

528
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,940
and left in a hurry.

529
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,380
What's going on?

530
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,540
How about this?

531
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,700
You go ahead.

532
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,940
I'll go see him

533
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,330
and then head directly
to the dock to meet you.

534
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,620
At this moment,

535
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,300
will you leave me alone again?

536
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,780
This time, I absolutely won't

537
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,100
leave you alone.

538
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,380
I promise to be there

539
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,220
