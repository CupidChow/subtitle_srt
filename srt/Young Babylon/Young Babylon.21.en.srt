285 yuan in all.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,390
I'm sorry, I was

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,630
in a rush when I came

28
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,840
and didn't bring enough money.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
How about this?

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
I'll leave my ID here

31
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,840
and come back to settle the payment
another day, okay?

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,520
This really won't do, sir.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,010
That's against our rules.

34
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,850
Well, how about this?

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
I'll give you 20 yuan now,

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
and you wait for me a bit.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,030
I'll go home and get the money.

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,280
- No, sir.
- You have to trust me.

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Listen,

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,960
I've been friends with the owner

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,470
of your hotel for many years, really.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,350
Sir, this really won't work.

43
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm sorry about this.

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,140
Big Feet, I didn't expect you
to be doing so well.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,290
Just treating us to a meal
won't be enough.

46

No matter how much you earn,

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
you should have come to the wedding.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,310
What's going on with you?

49
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,820
Let Big Feet arrange another one for you.

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,500
No, Juan won't agree.

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,510
Enough fussing. It's late.

52
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,400
We have to go home.

53
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,260
We'll meet again another day.

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,500
You must treat us again.

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,890
We're leaving now.

56
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,070
- Bye.
- Let us know when you get home.

57
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,500
Bye, bye, okay.

58
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,380
If you have any difficulties,

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,050
tell me anytime.

60
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,750
I'll smoke a cigarette.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
You two go home first.

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,890
- Okay.
- Take care.

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,290
I'll call a taxi.

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,730
No need.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,050
I've had a bit too much to drink.

66
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,940
Have a walk with me.

This is the last sip.

70
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,300
And then it's finished.

71
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,060
Another cup?

72
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,900
Can you still handle more?

73
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,180
Let me tell you the truth.

74
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,980
I usually

75
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,300
don't come out to drink,

76
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,260
but tonight,

77
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,180
I must drink

78
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,840
until I can't drink anymore.

79
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,940
Bottoms up.

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,260
Let's have another bottle.

81
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,660
Okay, okay.

82
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
- Okay.
- Waiter.

83
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,940
Enough.

84
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,060
That's enough for today.

85
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,220
Let's drink another day.

86
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,860
Why postpone it?

87
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,700
Listen, Mr. Huang,

88
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,540
I have some issues with you.

89
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,340
From the start, you've been
caring for her, defending her.

90
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,420
Why is that?

91
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,060
Tell me clearly today

92
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,900
what's going on between you two.

93
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,460
Otherwise, we must

94
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,780
continue this drink.

95
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,740
Is that okay?

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,860
Waiter.

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,500
Waiter.

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,460
Miss Bai is my fiancée.

99
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,620
I can't bear to see her drink more.

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,820
Mr. Huang,

101
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,500
you have good taste.

102
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,100
Alright,

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,980
since that's the case,

104
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,660
I wish you both well.

105
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,580
I wish you both well.

106
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,100
Are you okay?

107
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,980
Luckily, the room is upstairs.

108
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,980
You go back and rest first.

109
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,780
I'll come back after dropping him off.

110
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,620
Your acting was good.

111
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,620
Thank you.

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,540

to keep deceiving me?

I'm sorry.

122
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm just afraid that when I come back...

123
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,900
What are you afraid of?

124
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,140
That I won't like you anymore
because you are not doing well?

125
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,260
That Xiaolu, Guangnan, Little Pouter

126
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,580
will avoid you and not be friends
with you anymore?

I'm afraid of disappointing you.

128

Xiaoying,

129
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,180
I know that you have been

130
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
doing business with Xiaolu
to make money these years

131
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,340
just to support me,

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,660
to support my singing career.

133
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,060
But I feel really guilty.

134
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,540
I know how hard you've worked.

135
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,620
Xiaoying, more than once,

136
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,140
I've told myself

137
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,340
to just forget it,

138
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,900
come back and settle down.

139
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,740
But I really can't face you like that.

140
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,140
I've also told myself more than once

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
to hold on a little longer,

142
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,860

143

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,460
But Xiaoying,

145
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,300
I really tried my best.

146
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,220

that old thing surnamed Bi

190
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,860
kept trying to get me drunk.

191
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,980
I saw through him at a glance.

192
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,340
He used to do this too back then.

193
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,940
But guess what?

194
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
What?

195
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,380
I got him drunk.

196
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,060
I'm not bad, am I?

197
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Yeah, you're the best.

198
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,100
After several years,

199
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,890
how come your drinking capacity
has improved so much?

200
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,380
It's not always been this good.

201
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,660
I remember

202
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,060
the first time
negotiating at a drinking table,

203
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,660
I ended up in the hospital
getting my stomach pumped.

204
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,700
Another time,

205
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
I got drunk

206
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,740
and hit someone,

207
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,420
messed up a deal,

208
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,420
and had to apologize to the client.

209
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,700
But

210
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,300
things are different now.

211
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,180
I'm really good now.

212
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,620
It's safe to say

213
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,420
I'm second to none.

214
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,460
I've conquered the drinking scene
in Shanghai.

215
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,940
Didn't you say

216
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,540
you've been doing well these years?

217
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,940
Yeah,

218
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,940
I have.

219
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,780
Come on, get up.

220
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,300
If I don't say it like this,

221
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,140
I'll lose.

222
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,740
Let me help you lie down.

223
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,500
The floor is so cold.

224
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,180
Come on, get up now.

225
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,300
I'll stay on the ground.

226
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,220
You just said "lose".

227
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,460
What do you mean?

228
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,140
I just don't want to lose to Lu Xiaolu.

229
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,700
I want to tell him that

230
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,900
even without him,

231
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,660
I can still live well.

232
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,940
I, Bai Lan,

233
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,100
can live well without anyone.

234
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,660
What are you looking at?

235
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,340
Don't believe it?

236
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,620
If I had known you'd go through so much,

237
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,500
I would never have left you.

238
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,820
Who do you think you are?

239
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
A savior?

240
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,940
Let me tell you,

241
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,860
even though I've had

242
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,900
a tough time these years,

243
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,500
I do have savings.

244
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,460
Soon, I'll have my own company,

245
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,140
my own projects.

246
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
By then, I won't have to talk business

247
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,260
by drinking anymore.

248
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,820
No,

249
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,700
more accurately,

250
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
I'll drink when I want to drink

251
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,740
and won't when I don't want to.

252
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,020
No one can force me.

253
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,020
So, this food factory project

254
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,740
is important to you, right?

255
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,620
Go to hell.

256
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,460
I don't want to live
this kind of life anymore.

257
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,540
But

258
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,620
if I stop drinking,

259
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,420
won't my great capacity

260
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,660
go to waste?

261
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,220
I have a good idea.

262
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,340
I've decided to pass on
my drinking skills to you.

263
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,620
How about that?

264
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,180
Will you be my disciple?

265
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,420
Alright.

266
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,940
I'll accept it.

267
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,620
But not today.

268
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,580
You're already too drunk

269
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,500
to pass your skills.

270
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,060
Let me help you lie down.

271
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,260
Get up.

272
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,340
- No.
- Come on.

273
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,420
- No, I won't.
- Come on.

274
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,500
I'll just lie on the ground.

275
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,820
I'll go get you some water.

276
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,660
Wait for me.

277
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,660
I don't want water.

278
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,540
I want alcohol.

279
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,740
You're already drunk.
You can't drink anymore.

280
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,620
I'm not drunk.

281
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,020
I want to drink.

282
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,620
I'll pass that to you today.

283
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Okay, okay.

284
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,740
I'll go buy you some alcohol.

285
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,580
Yeah.

286
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,300
Excuse me.

287
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,620
Please get me two dozens of beer.

288
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,780
Sir, which brand do you prefer?

289
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,060
Double Deer, Aoke,

290
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,140
or Singo?

291
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,700
Never mind.

292
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,220
Just give me two yogurt

293
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,500
and a can of honey.

294
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,340
Alright.

295
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,540
Didn't you say
you won't compromise this time?

296
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,660
Are you really sure about this?

297
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,140
(Director's Office)

298
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,980
I see.

299
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,780
Simply put,

300
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,020
the factory has lost control

301
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,260
over the workers.

302
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,260
That's why someone maliciously threatened

303
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,660
Manager Bai's personal safety.

304
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,380
No, this factory has always had

305
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,100
unresolved issues like unpaid wages

306
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,140
and medical expenses.

307
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,300
The workers have no choice.

308
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,580
After such an incident,

309
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,660
why didn't you report it?

310
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,500
- Well, you see, they are...
- It was my decision.

311
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,740
Manager Bai.

312
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,500
Your friend?

313
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,500
Yes.

314
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,860
He should be fired.

315
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,660
Why?

316
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,100
Doing this will only backfire.

317
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,260
He's your friend.

318
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,420
I won't pursue legal action against him,

319
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,140
but I can't pretend nothing happened.

320
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,700
Mr. Huang,

321
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,740
this worker has been

322
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,980
an outstanding worker in the factory

323
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,860
for many years

324
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,780
and was even awarded

325
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,140
as a city-level labor model.

326
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,220
But now, he's neither outstanding

327
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,300
nor exemplary.

328
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,980
I... I'll step out for a moment.

329
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,340
(Director's Office)

330
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,740
Do you have to be so arbitrary?

331
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,340
Didn't we agree that I would

332
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,500
handle this matter entirely?

333
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,180
Why don't you listen to my advice?

334
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,100
Only by doing this
can the workers understand

335
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,780
that causing trouble
will never achieve their goals,

336
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,860
no matter how long they've worked

337
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,900
or how high their status is.

338
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,140
I don't want to

339
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,340
see such things happen again.

340
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,100
You are just using violence
to control violence.

341
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,220
I don't think firing anyone

342
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
can solve the problem.

343
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,980
If you insist on doing this,

344
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,580
just fire me too.

345
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,300
Before completing this task,

346
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,540
you have no right to leave.

347
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,260
Manager Bai,

348
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,300
the keys to the cold storage.

349
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,540
The workers aren't entirely unreasonable.

350
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
I've reported to you before

351
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,220
about the cold storage issue.

352
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,820
They have returned the keys.

353
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,780
It's surprising that someone in the factory
has such awareness.

354
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,220
What's his name?

355
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,820
Lu Xiaolu.

356
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,300
Master Niu,

357
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,460
even Xiaolu has backed down,

358
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,540
what should we do?

359
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,620
Well...

360
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,540
You need to figure out a solution.

361
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,340
(Refrigerated Truck)

362
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,300
Master,

363
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,380
don't worry about it.

364
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,100
- Let's go.
- But...

365
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,820
Who is that person?

366
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
Veteran fitter Master Niu.

367
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,300
The model worker who splashed

368
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,380
pig's blood?

369
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,220
All of us

370
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,580
can put in some effort

371
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,900
to tide over this situation.

372
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,540
To others,

373
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,340
this might solve a big problem.

374
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,340
Why are you still thinking about others?

375
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,220
When Ma led people
to take the ice storage,

376
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,460
your attitude was not like this.

377
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,740
I'll pay for the rent
of the new cold storage.

378
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,700
I won't implicate you.

379
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,500
Do you think we're afraid to spend money?

380
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,420
We just don't want you

381
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,540
to be manipulated by Bai Lan every time.

382
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,900
That's enough.

383
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,340
I know.

384
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,220
This is the last time.

385
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,740
It won't happen again.

386
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,420
You all know that

387
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,260
I left Shanghai

388
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,140
without saying goodbye.

389
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
I owe it to her.

390
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,220
This time,

391
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,260
consider it as me repaying her.

392
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,580
Hello?

393
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,780
What?

394
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,180
They might fire Master Niu?

395
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,740
Okay, okay, I got it.

396
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,580
Lu Xiaolu,

397
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
look what you did.

398
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,980
♪Escaping the night in moonlight♪

399
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,060

406
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,460
Doctor Bai?

407
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,300
Big Feet.

408
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,980
Long time no see.

409
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,860
Long time no see.

410
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,020
Well,

411
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,940
it's been a while since I last came.

412
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,740
I really missed here.

413
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
So I came to take a look.

414
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,180
Me too.

415
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,980
How have you been doing
in Beijing these years?

416
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,020
Beijing

417
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,340
is great,

418
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,340
a big city.

419
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,340
But

420
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,580
there are many people

421
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,440
with the same dreams as mine.

422
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,300
There are more stages, too.

423
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,340
Doctor Bai,

424
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,860
do you know?

425
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,060
In Beijing, there's a bar street

426
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,020
where I perform

427
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,380
every night.

428
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,540
Many people come to watch me sing.

429
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,700
It's lively.

430
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,260
When you release an album,

431
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,620
remember to send me a copy.

432
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,140
Do you remember?

433
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,820
Xiaolu sneakily

434
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,020
fixed your bike there

435
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,660
back then.

436
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,300
It was so many years ago.

437
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,220
Was it that long ago?

438
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,620
It's like

439
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,020
yesterday to me.

440
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,980
It's been a long time.

441
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,900
Things have changed.

442
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
But you

443
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,940
finally won Xiaoying's heart.

444
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,020
Xiaolu

445
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,420
argued with Guangnan

446
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,420
for you today.

447
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,380
Is it about the cold storage?

448
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,220
Yeah.

449
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,420
You know, Doctor Bai,

450
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,700
Xiaolu never stands by

451
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,700
when you're in trouble.

452
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,540
Technically, I should thank him,

453
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,820
but I don't want to see him now.

454
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,380
Do you not want to

455
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,340
or are you afraid?

456
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,220
It's been a long time

457
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,460
since we drank together, right?

458
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,300
Yes, Dad.

459
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,300
I've spent little time with you
these years.

460
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,420
You don't have to accompany me.

461
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
I'm quite comfortable

462
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,700
here by myself.

463
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,420
I understand.

464
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,020
Our house is full of memories
of you and Mom.

465
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,220
That's right.

466
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,220
Your mother

467
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,140
used to complain that
my cooking was too oily

468
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,060
and salty,

469
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,220
but I could never change.

470
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,300
Now that she's gone,

471
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,420
whenever I cook,

472
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,700
I feel like she's nagging at me.

473
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,740
I just...

474
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,100
That's insane. Come on.

475
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,180
They say time can make you
forget everything,

476
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,300
but it's not that easy.

477
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,260
I've heard about

478
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,260
Bai Lan's situation.

479
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,580
After all these years,

480
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,140
she seems like a different person.

481
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,140
I don't know if I should believe her.

482
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,620
Do you

483
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,340
believe in yourself?

484
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,780
Believing in myself?

485
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,180
I mean

486
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,860
do you believe you are right about her?

487
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,300
Dr. Tian.

488
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,020
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

489
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,100
I called you out in a hurry

490
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,740
because an old friend
also wants to see you.

491
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,340
- Okay.
- I hope you don't mind.

492
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,780
- No problem.
- Please.

493
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,340
Master Niu.

494
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,980
Please sit.

495
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,300
Please.

496
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,860
Thank you.

497
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,100
Coming.

498
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,060
Dr. Tian,

499
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,900
I heard about your wife's matter.

500
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,580
Tian's wife

501
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,700
had no job.

502
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,900
The factory used to

503
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,540
reimburse some of her medical expenses,

504
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,020
but then they stopped.

505
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,940
Her hepatitis

506
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,260
turned into cirrhosis,

507
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,540
and then liver cancer.

508
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,660
Tian sold his house

509
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,100
to treat his wife.

510
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,340
Ah, let's not talk about this.

511
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,860
Let's have a drink.

512
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,820
Let's drink.

513
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,220
Okay.

514
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,140
By the way,

515
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,700
these are the medicines you often take.

516
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,580
I remember they're
hard to find in Fucheng,

517
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,460
so I brought some
from Shanghai for you.

518
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Thank you.

519
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,340
You are so thoughtful

520
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,060
and even care about an old man like me.

521
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,860
It's been years.

522
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,940
I was worried you wouldn't

523
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,100
like the Fucheng dishes,

524
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,940
so I made some sandwiches for you,

525
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
just like

526
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,460
you taught me back then.

527
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,620
(Good Cat Restaurant)
Our factory hasn't been performing well.

528
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,380
They can't pay salaries,

529
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,100
so they distribute canned goods
from the inventory

530
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,060
to everyone.

531
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,620
I use bread

532
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,980
and various canned goods

533
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,740
to make different flavored sandwiches.

534
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,380
I remember back in the factory,
the canned fish

535
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,500
was the most popular.

536
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,540
Every Friday, you would rush off work

537
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,380
to line up and get some.

538
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,340
Yes.

539
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
I didn't expect
you still remember these things.

540
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,700
But you should also remember that

541
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,420
you were once

542
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,500
part of our food factory, right?

543
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,820
Are you blaming me

544
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,820
for something?

545
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,660
You two must

546
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,700
have a lot to say to me.

547
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,620
I'm all ears.

548
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,500
Dr. Bai,

549
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
I'll still address you

550
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,780
the way we did

551
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,020
in the factory.

552
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,140
Us workers

553
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,140
don't have big demands,

554
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,860
just pay us our wages

555
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,900
and cover

556
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,380
our medical expenses.

557
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,780
Then we'll do whatever

558
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
you ask us to do.

559
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,900
But if you drive me away,

560
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,220
will that solve the problem?

561
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,740
Salaries still won't be paid,

562
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,340
medical expenses won't be covered,

563
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,890
and the factory
will continue to deteriorate

564
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,700
until it closes.

565
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,220
Workers will be laid off.

566
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,780
Not to mention the whole country,

567
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
how many factories

568
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,260
in Fucheng have closed?

569
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,060
So what I need now is

570
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,340
for everyone to trust me.

571
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,340
As long as we revive this factory,

572
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,100
these lingering issues will all be solved.

573
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,860
How can we trust you?

574
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,460
The factory has promised us
many times before.

575
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,380
But each time,
it's just an empty promise.

576
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,700
They keep delaying, day after day.

577
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,940
So many people,

578
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
so many families,

579
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,260
have been dragged down by this.

580
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,580
But this time is different.

581
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,740
We're all in the same boat.

582
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,740
Our goals are the same.

583
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,900
Yes,

584
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,460
reforming definitely has risks,

585
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,340
but it's only temporary.

586
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Once we have a modern corporate system

587
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,940
and improved management,

588
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,740
the food factory
will definitely be revived.

589
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,740
When the factory is profitable,

590
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,260
medical expenses and wages
won't be a problem anymore.

591
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,420
And in the future, we will expand

592
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,220
and introduce new equipment
and develop new products,

593
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,900
don't you look forward to that?

594
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Why should we believe you?

595
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,780
I will convince the Italians

596
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,740
to cooperate with us.

597
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,260
When I succeed,

598
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,220
you will believe me, okay?

599
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,340
Really?

600
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
I'll be honest with you.

601
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,940
I made a bet.

602
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,300
If I can't revive the factory,

603
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,620
I lose.

604
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,740

608
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,740
Did you arrange this?

609
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,260
Since you did,

610
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
why didn't you come out yourself

611
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,300
but let your master talk to me?

612
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,820
It is good to make it clear

613
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,020
to Master Niu.

614
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,900
He has authority in the factory.

615
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,340
Everyone listens to him.

616
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,460
I know.

617
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,900
But the pig blood incident last time

618
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,300
really had nothing to do with him.

619
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,820
Will he still be fired?

620
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
Don't worry about that.

621
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,860
With me around, it won't happen.

622
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,660
That's good.

623
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,380
Thank you.

624
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,580
For what?

625
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,860
For the cold storage.

626
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,340
No need.

627
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,060
I did it for myself.

628
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,100
Is that so?

629
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,940
Yes.

630
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,020

633
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,260
Alright, I'll leave then.

634
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,460
Go talk to your master.

635
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,580

of our conversation.

There's progress on the workers' side.

645

Master Niu promised me that

646
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,500
he can convince the workers
to resume work.

647
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,220
Really?

648
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,380
They changed their minds so quickly?

649
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,460
Because deep down,

650
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,700
they all love the factory

651
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,980

the last bit of hope.

Master,

655
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,620
the factory really didn't fire you?

656
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,940
Of course.

What do you think we are doing?

658
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
Taking some parts

659
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,660
and selling them for retirement?

660
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
We all agreed that

661
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,940
if you were fired,

662
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,100

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,140
You also scared me!

- Tall or short?
- Fat or thin?

697
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,940
I didn't see clearly.

710
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,220
I brought Mr. Huang here to see you.

711
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,580
Don't get up.

712
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,420
Hello, Master Niu.

713
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,020
It's regrettable what happened.

714
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,620
I promise you and all the workers that

715
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,540
we'll get to the bottom of this

716
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,940
and catch the real culprit.

717
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,660
Thank you. Thank you.

718
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,540
It's a Greek gift.

719
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,540
I heard you've been working hard

720
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,220
to ensure the factory resumes smoothly.

721
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,420
Why not take this opportunity to rest?

722
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,060
The hospital expenses
will be covered by the factory.

723
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,300

724
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,100

This is a matter of the factory.

735

As far as I know,

736
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,900
you're no longer part of the factory.
