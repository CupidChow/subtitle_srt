We've called everyone we could

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,380

(Good Cat Restaurant)

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,740
It's been a while since you ate here,
hasn't it?

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,380
I used to find it odd.

36
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,040
Now, I haven't had it in a long time.

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,050
I even miss it a bit.

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,290
When you go back to Shanghai,

39
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,420
I'll ask the owner to pack a big portion
for you to take away.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,380
Actually, I don't know why.

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,980
But this time coming back,
I don't feel like going back to Shanghai.

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
Really?

43
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
I get it.

44
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,170
The pace of life in Shanghai is so fast.

45
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,570
The pressure must be huge.

46
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,800
Consider days in Fucheng a vacation.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
That's also pretty good.

48
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,070
Is the flavor too bland?

49
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,770
Add some of this seafood chili sauce.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,100
I pickled it myself.

51
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,010
Sir, do you remember me?

52
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,170
On August 7, 1996, just one minute

53
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,470
to eight o'clock.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,890
Wasn't it you two?

55
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,500
Hard to forget that.

56
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,630
Enjoy.

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,760
My dear,

58
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,010
look at my watch.

59
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,160
One minute

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,470
before 8 PM on August 7, 1996.

61
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,860
Remember this moment.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,450
Because in the next minute,

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,260
I am about to become your boyfriend.

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,010
We were so silly back then.

65
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,940
Is being silly bad?

66
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,770
We did so many foolish things.

67
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,940
Right.

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,770
Back then,

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,090
together, we caught a pervert,

70
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,530
scared a German expert,

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,940
and even helped Afang
deal with Ding Dezhong.

72
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,500
It's been so many years.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,620
Feels like it was just yesterday.

74
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,860
Right.

75
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,740
How could I forget her?

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,890
- Who?
- Afang.

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,960
After Afang left Fucheng,

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,860
she went to Guangzhou.

79
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,270
And then?

80
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,470
She became an agent
for foreign food brands in Guangzhou,

81
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,520
and she's thriving.

82
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,770
We could ask her for help.

83
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,910
Xiaolu,

84
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,510
I just checked the map.

85
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,450
From Fucheng to Guangzhou

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,260
is over a thousand kilometers.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,620
If we hurry,

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,090
we can make it in over half a day.

89
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,230
Bai Lan,

90
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,470
with just that address above,

91
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,410
can you find her?

92
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,380
I think we should be able to.

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,430
Xiaolu says this is something
Afang had someone bring back

94
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,740
from Guangzhou before.

95
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,680
But you only have three days left.

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,400
If this trip to Guangzhou
doesn't work out,

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,740
you'll completely run out of time.

98
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,410
We don't have any other choice.

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,500
Right, here's the information
you asked for.

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,590
Thank you.

101
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll leave the factory in your hands
while I'm away.

102
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,910
Don't worry.
If there's any news about Huang Qing,

103
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,940
I'll contact you immediately.

104

you looked down on me,

called me a thug,

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,300
This outfit suits him, right?

190
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Dajiang.

191
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,900
Go.

192
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,260
- Lu Dajiang.
- Dajiang!

193
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,380
Do you still think this is the past?

194
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,500
Look at you.

195
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
You're just a janitor now.

196
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,740
Still think you're Boss Ma?

197
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,700
It's the 21st century.

198
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,940
Boss Ma is outdated.

199
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,420
Get him!

200
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,540
- Dajiang!
- Ms. Tao!

201
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,380
Dajiang!

202
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,140
- Dajiang!
- Let's go.

203
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,300
Dajiang!

204
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,540
Dajiang!

205
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,460
Get Boss Hu out!

206
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,460
- He hit Boss Hu!
- Dajiang!

207
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,660
Ms. Tao, let's go!

208
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,260
Dajiang, stop hitting him!

209
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,700
You could kill him, Dajiang!

210
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,340
Let go! Stop hitting him, Dajiang!

211
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,500
You could kill him!

212
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,860
Dajiang!

213
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,340
- Ms. Tao!
- Don't touch me!

214
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,780
Thank you for today.

215
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,780
Have we really

216
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
become so estranged now?

217
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,700
You're hurt.

218
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,140
Let me take you to the hospital.

219
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,820
I'm fine.

220
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,860
I haven't finished my work.

221
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm leaving now.

222
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Lu Dajiang.

223
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,020
The day you came back,

224
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,460
we threw a banquet for you.
Why didn't you show up?

225
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,220
Were you afraid to see me?

226
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,940
If you've forgotten me already,

227
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,660
why do you keep the letter I gave you?

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,580
Why keep the scarf I gave you?

229
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,660
Every day you pretend to clean,

230
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,740
right up to the hotel entrance.

231
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,420
Is the entrance

232
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,660
your responsibility? Answer me.

233
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Tao,

234
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,540
it's been so many years.

235
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,220
Why can't you let it go?

236
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,140
You left for Hong Kong without a word,

237
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,820
not even a goodbye.

238
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,100
Not even a goodbye!

239
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,260
What happened back then was my fault.

240
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,460
But now I'm just a janitor.

241
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,580
You shouldn't waste

242
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,540
any more time on me.

243
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,380
Can't you see it?

244
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,500
In these past few years in prison,

245
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,180
I've moved on

246
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,620
from the past.

247
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,700
Don't go!

248
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,420
Don't go!

249
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,940
Don't touch me!

250
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,380
What did you do?

251
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,420
What did you do?

252
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,420
Didn't you say you'd take me with you?

253
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,300
Weren't you going
to let me accompany you?

254
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,580
Why did you leave me behind?

255
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,740
You liar!

256
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,620
You big liar!

257
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,780
What did you do?

258
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,230
♪Memories never seem to cease♪

259
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:19,930
♪Staying in the day we met♪

260
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,890
♪Just let it be vague♪

261
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,940
Will you leave me?

262
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,420
(Guangzhou)

263
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,500
Hello.

264
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
We're here to see

265
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,220
Liu Fang, the general manager
of Xiaoran International Trade.

266
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,740
Do you two have an appointment?

267
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,900
No.

268
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,700
Sorry, you can't enter
without an appointment.

269
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,460
There seems to be no one named Liu Fang
in their company.

270
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,500
Are you looking for
Ms. Liu Yang instead?

271
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,740
Sorry, no.

272
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,100
Didn't you contact her?

273
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,140
I did,

274
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,420
but couldn't get through.

275
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,500
But she's our only lead.

276
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,540
We can only

277
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,660
try our luck.

278
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,860
We've wasted another day.

279
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,740
Just wait a bit longer.

280
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,900
What if she comes out after work?

281
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,900
Even if it's until tomorrow morning.

282
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,660
Look.

283
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,500
Do you see that star?

284
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,140
That one

285
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,700
is a weather-predicting star.

286
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,260
Though there are

287
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,700
dark clouds

288
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
everywhere,

289
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,220
as long as there's one star,

290
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,340
tomorrow will be a good day.

291
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,820
So,

292
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,420
before tomorrow comes,

293
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,340
let's not give up yet.

294
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,220
Didn't know you could read the skies.

295
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,020
Watched the stars too much. That's why.

296
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,300
Actually, on the day you drank too much

297
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,020
and asked me to buy more liquor,

298
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,820
I saw it all when I came back.

299
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,660
Though I don't like

300
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,620
that Mr. Huang,

301
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,580
it's good

302
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,740
that someone is taking care of you.

303
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,580
What are you laughing at?

304
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,180
You don't think

305
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,860
I'm involved with him, do you?

306
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,220
Isn't it?

307
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,500
Of course not.

308
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,940
Lu Xiaolu,

309
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,820
you're back with the liquor?

310
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,700
Here I come.

311
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,620
Coming.

312
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,300
Mr. Huang.

313
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,540
Are you okay?

314
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,540
I'm fine. Don't worry.

315
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,380
Good night.

316
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,180
It turns out

317
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,100
that I misunderstood.

318
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,060
Is that Afang?

319
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,060
Afang!

320
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,580
Xiaolu!

321
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,820
Afang!

322
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Bai Lan!

323
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,460
I haven't been called Afang
for a long time.

324
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,940
No wonder you couldn't find me.

325
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,740
This is my new name.

326
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
Lily Liu.

327
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,940
Haven't seen you in years.

328
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,580
You've changed a lot.

329
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,220
Of course.

330
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,060
But you two haven't changed.

331
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,260
Back in the factory,

332
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,540
I could see

333
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,500
you were made for each other.

334
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,100
Are you together now?

335
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,420
How's it going?

336
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,300
Married yet?

337
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,540
No.

338
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,620
You misunderstood.

339
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,180
We're just friends.

340
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,260
Sorry about that.

341
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,220
No worries.

342
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,420
So,

343
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,620
what brings you all the way here

344
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,900
to find me?

345
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,100
Xiaolu and I have started a project,

346
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,140
and we hope you can join us.

347
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,140
Take a look at the proposal first.

348
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,020
Food factory.

349
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
Here's the thing.

350
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,980
Since your company
deals with food trade,

351
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,220
this project

352
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,000
is really suitable
for collaboration with you.

353
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,260
Xiaolu,

354
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,300
Bai Lan.

355
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,580
Did you forget

356
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,380
how I left the food factory?

357
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,860
But now, the food factory

358
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,220
is different from before.

359
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,140
The leadership
has been completely changed.

360
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,340
The people you disliked are gone.

361
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,780
It's my company

362
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,100
that has taken over the food factory.

363
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,020
I am now the general manager.

364
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,980
Do you know why I changed my name?

365
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,460
It was to forget that

366
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,820
disgusting past.

367
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm truly happy

368
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,540
to see you both again.

369
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,020
Back when I was down,

370
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,420
out of so many in the factory,

371
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,780
only you two sincerely stood by my side.

372
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,260
I remember

373
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,740
the favor I owe you.

374
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,780
But this factory,

375
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,100
I never want to have anything
to do with it again in my life,

376
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,860
let alone save it.

377
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,580
Moreover, I now prefer

378
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,100
developing new domestic brands.

379
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,900
The introduction of imported brands

380
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,620
is no longer the focus of our business.

381
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,940
Sorry.

382
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,700
I really can't help you.

383
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,540
It's okay.

384
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,420
It's okay.

385
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
Oh, by the way,

386
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,900
I brought you

387
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,340
a small gift this time.

388
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,020
Even if we can't collaborate,

389
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,420
we can still be friends.

390
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,140
Sure.

391
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,180
What gift did you bring for Afang?

392
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,940
I made some milk tea powder myself.

393
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,700
Just a little gift.

394
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,380
We need to hurry back,

395
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,860
or it'll start raining soon.

396
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,340
Didn't you say today
would be good weather?

397
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,500
It wouldn't rain.

398
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,340
If I hadn't said that,

399
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,700
maybe we would have
given up back there.

400
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,540
Even though finding Afang
wasn't very likely,

401
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,340
if we gave up ourselves,

402
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,380
then there really
would have been no hope.

403
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
We didn't accomplish anything,

404
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,900
yet you're still so happy?

405
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,340
I don't know.

406
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,580
I just feel like today

407
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,620
is the best day I've had
in the last five years.

408
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,580
Even if there's a storm ahead,

409
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,780

Yes.

413

If we don't go crazy now,

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,980

Is the clay pot rice
in Guangzhou delicious?

441
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,780
Only Qin Juan in the factory

442
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,420
knows about my trip to Guangzhou.

443
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,180
You had someone follow me?

444
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,380
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

445
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,460
You're not only my boss

446
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,540
but my opponent at the gambling table.

447
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,180
I don't need
to report everything to you, right?

448
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Now, do you still think

449
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,660
you have a chance to win?

450
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,140
Why not?

451
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,700
You gave me five days.

452
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,100
Now, there's one day left.

453
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,220
The deal is off.

454
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,060
Why?

455
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Does winning matter that much to you?

456
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,580
Of course, it's important.

457
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,260
Initially, I just wanted to reclaim

458
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,380
what was mine.

459
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,180
But now, I've gambled the entire factory.

460
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,460
I've made promises to the workers.

461
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,060
I can't betray them.

462
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,460
What if you lose?

463
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,180
Do you know?

464
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,500
I really don't want you to lose.

465
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,860
Stop cooperating with Lu Xiaolu.

466
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,060
Don't let him
drag you back to your old life.

467
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,460
Even if the food factory is gone,

468
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,020
I can promise you to invest

469
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,180
to cover the workers' losses.

470
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,300
You don't sound like yourself.

471
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,100
What do you mean?

472
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,580
You once told me.

473
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620
As a businessman,

474
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,620
you would never invest money
without seeing a return.

475
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,060
As a wise person,

476
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,980
you would never favor any opponent.

477
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,180
But look at your methods now.

478
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,100
You've become weak

479
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,100
yet arrogantly harsh.

480
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,620
You know

481
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,260
that developing real estate

482
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,940
is a major trend in the domestic market.

483
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,300
Once this option is laid out,

484
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,340
the food factory
will have no other way out.

485
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,100
You can't change this era,

486
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
nor can you save those people.

487
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,660
Go back to Shanghai now,

488
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,340
and I can pretend
none of this ever happened.

489
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,060
If you're still not satisfied,

490
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,380
you can choose

491
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,780
to stay by my side

492
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,980
with a different status.

493
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,060
We can both win.

494
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,340
Don't touch me.

495
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,020
Mr. Huang,

496
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,540
I think I need to reassess you.

497
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,020
I was worried about you,

498
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,060
so I came to check.

499
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,540
You don't look well.

500
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,340
What did Huang Qing say to you?

501
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,740
Are you fired?

502
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,980
If only that were true.

503
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,300
I'll take you back to the hotel to rest.

504
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,660
Boss Hu,

505
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,140
begin the operation.

506
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,100
I'll take you up.

507
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,100
No need.

508
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,540
I'm just staying one last night.

509
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,100
Tomorrow, I'll change to another hotel.

510
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,020
It's awkward

511
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,260
running into Huang Qing.

512
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,020
Then rest well.

513
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,500
Don't worry about those trivial matters.

514
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,660
I'll take care of everything.

515
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,020
Tomorrow morning, I'll pick you up

516
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,300
and take you to the new hotel.

517
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,340
Okay.

518
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,300
Either help the workers

519
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,500
reclaim what's theirs

520
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,180
or find them a new path.

521
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,660
You won't go back

522
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,940
until these matters are settled,

523
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,260
right?

524
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,980
Right.

525
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,540
I'm really, really, really glad

526
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,140
that we can work together again.

527
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm glad too.

528
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,020
Hope we can work well together.

529
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,580
Hope we can work well together.

530
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,460
Hello.

531
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,980
Yeah.

532
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,180
This is she speaking. Who's that?

533
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,060
Mrs. Mancini.

534
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,900
How did you get my number?

535
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,300
Oh, yeah.

536
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,420
That was a gift for you.

537
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Hope you like it.

538
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,900
I beg you pardon?

539
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,100
What do you mean by that?

540
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,060
Lu Xiaolu,

541
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,540
how dare you mess
with Mr. Huang's woman?

542
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,540
Do you have a death wish?

543
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,980
I'm giving you a friendly warning

544
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,020
out of the years of friendship

545
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,980
I had with your cousin.

546
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,900
Stay away from Miss Bai.

547
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,860
The food factory's affairs

548
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,340
are not for you to meddle in.

549
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,540
If you get in the way
of us making money,

550
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,900
I'll throw you into the sea
to feed the fish.

551
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,460
Let's go.

552
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,660
I didn't fire you.

553
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,820
I just wanted you to return to Shanghai.

554
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,580
As long as you stay

555
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,600
out of the affairs in Fucheng,

556
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,100
our relationship
can be the same as before.

557
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,660
What relationship?

558
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,300
For Lu Xiaolu?

559
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,420
For no one else.

560
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,820
I just don't want to be deceived anymore.

561
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,660
I am your mentor,

562
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,420
and also your boss.

563
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,260
I have my business plans.

564
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,740
It's not really deception.

565
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,180
What about Mr. Mancini?

566
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,820
Why did he leave?

567
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,660
What are you trying to say?

568
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,980
Coincidentally,

569
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,020
I had sent a gift to his wife.

570
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,580
She called yesterday to thank me,

571
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,180
and she told me something

572
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,260
I didn't know.

573
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,580
I admit I kept it from you

574
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,300
because I knew

575
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,220
you would struggle
to accept the sudden halt

576
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,420
of the food factory's reform plans.

577
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,700
I hoped it would be easier for you.

578
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,300
You seem not to understand

579
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,620
the problem between us.

580
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Over these five years,

581
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,920
you've blocked me
from the position I wanted to pursue,

582
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,460
saying it was for my good.

583
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,580
You drove away my business partners,

584
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,940
also claiming it was for my good.

585
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,220
You kept plans from me,

586
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,860
making all my efforts a joke,

587
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,960
still claiming it was for my good.

588
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,340
In your eyes, what am I?

589
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,260
A puppet to be manipulated

590
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,220
or a fool to be played with?

591
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,860
To others,

592
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,280
I try to be
as straightforward as possible.

593
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,700
I did this because...

594
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,740
Because I care about our relationship,

595
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,900
and I care more about how you see me.

596
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,300
This car is company-provided,

597
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,620
not personally mine.

598
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,860
Take it.

599
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,500
I've said it before.

600
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,540
You're not entitled to leave

601
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,820
until I fire you.

602
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,660
Mr. Huang,

603
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,100
make it clear.

604
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,460
This time, I'm the one firing you.

605
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,260
Are you really sure about this?

606
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,180
I've never been so sure

607
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,740
in these five years.

608
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,060
Hello, Dr. Bai.

609
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,940
Dajiang?

610
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,980
Where's Xiaolu?

611
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,580
Why didn't you tell me?

612
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,620
Trying to hide it from me?

613
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,500
Dajiang,

614
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,140
look at this tactical boot.

615
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,540
Doesn't it look familiar?

616
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,620
Kind of.

617
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,140
Who beat you up like this?

618
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,420
It's okay.

619
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,220
I've always been tough.

620
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,940
It's just some superficial wounds.

621
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,460
Nothing serious.

622
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,740
I want to show you something.

623
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,180
I wrestled this off

624
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,180
from one of those guys yesterday.

625
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,540
Boss,

626
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,420
stop hitting him,

627
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,580
or we could kill him.

628
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,020
Look at the sole.

629
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,660
Doesn't it look familiar?

630
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,060
Same sole.

631
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,700
Boss Hu has always had a grudge
against my brother.

632
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,580
It's one thing for him to hit me,

633
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,620
but why did he hit my master?

634
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,140
I guess Boss Hu and Huang Qing

635
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,100
are in this together now.

636
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,020
Dr. Bai,

637
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,620
could you please take care of him?

638
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,260
I need to step out.

639
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,060
Dajiang,

640
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,220
where are you going?

641
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,260
