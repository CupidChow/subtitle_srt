131
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,340

for a short time period,

132
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,900
why are you defending her already?

133
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,380
Why are you acting this way?

134
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,260
That's right.

135
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,260

137
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,340
Stop right there.

138
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,500
I say that to you because

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,860
I take you as family.

140

as you want?

142
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,830
Do you still take this place
as your home?

143
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,900

144
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,100

You can't throw that away.

154
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,980
So what if I do?

155
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,180
You betrayed Xiaolu for personal gain.

164
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,500

Oh, I forgot,

166
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,020

178
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,500

is where my cousin used to live.

190
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,700
He's not here anymore,

191
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,340
so it's under my care now.

192
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,540
You can stay here without worry.

193
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,060
No one will bother you.

194
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
Lu Xiaolu...

195
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,340
Stop.

196
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,300
Don't thank me.

197
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,460
I won't listen.

198
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,420
I'm afraid of your thanks.

199
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,260
Then let me buy you a drink.

200
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,660
Sure.

201
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Rock, paper, scissors.

202
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,340
Again.

203
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,420
Rock, paper, scissors.

204
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,820
Finally, I won.

205
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,940
Okay, okay, fine.

206
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,500
It's my turn to lose one round.

207
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,540
Then let me ask you a question.

208
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,420
When was the last time you wet the bed?

209
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,540
That's too far back.

210
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
I really don't remember.

211
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,180
Let me think.

212
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,340
I only remember
when I was in elementary school,

213
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,980
the first time Li Guangnan

214
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,860
went to a fight with me.

215
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,700
Guess what happened?

216
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,540
He got scared and wet his pants.

217
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,740
You remember him wetting his pants,

218
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,220
but you don't remember you doing that?

219
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,700
I really don't remember.

220
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,340
If you don't believe me, ask another one.

221
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,260
If that's too far back,

222
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,380
I'll ask something more recent.

223
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,020
Bring it on.

224
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,260
I'll answer truthfully.

225
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,060
I was the one who hit him,

226
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,940
but you're the one being punished.

227
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,860
Why didn't you ask anything?

228
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,900
If you're determined to go to Shanghai,

229
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,300
then all I can do

230
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,580
is support you.

231
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,740
Weren't you afraid
that I might betray you?

232
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,820
When the police asked me to choose,

233
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,980
what if I chose myself?

234
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,660
You wouldn't.

235
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,900
Why?

236
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,380
Because I'm sure I won't betray you.

237
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,820
So, I'm equally sure
that you won't betray me.

238
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,140
It's that simple.

239
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
I'll unconditionally
support all your choices.

240
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,260
Including going to Shanghai?

241
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,580
You are leaving this place

242
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,500
for the life you want.

243
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,820
But I

244
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,500
don't even know

245
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,340
what I want.

246
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,580
What reason would I have
to stop you from leaving?

247
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,420
Everyone chooses

248
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,620
their own path.

249
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,100
No one has the right

250
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,860
to stop others from choosing their path,

251
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,580
no matter how much they like them.

252
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,740
So, ask me a question.

253
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,900
Sure,

254
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
what question?

255
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,740
Ask me,

256
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,740
"Bai Lan,

257
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,300

Hey, Bai Lan.

287
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,500
Director Bi,

288
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,860
I left the documents you asked me

289
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,180
to translate on your desk.

290
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,740
Good.

291
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,340
Hey, Bai,

292
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,380
how's your work at the SLI Bureau?

293
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,220
Are you getting used to it?

294
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm quite used to it.

295
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
Good.

296
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,360
If you encounter
any difficulties in the future,

297
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,260
just come to me

298
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,100
without hesitation.

299
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,780
Sure.

300
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,900

(Let's meet at the park after work. Bai Lan)

302
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:16,220
(Vice Director's Office)

303
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,260
Bai Lan, you're early.

304
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,620
This place is nice.

305
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,660
The scenery is beautiful

306
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,580
and it's quiet.

307
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,100
- Director Bi.
- Oh, don't call me Director Bi.

308
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,340
That's too formal.

309
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,500
Just call me Bi.

310
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,020
- Bi.
- That's right.

311
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,500
Regarding Ding Dezhong's matter,

312
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,140
I want to thank you in person.

313
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,900
Look at you being so polite again.

314
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,660
This matter,

315
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,580
I did it willingly for you.

316
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,820
Besides,

317
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
I'm very happy about

318
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,980
you inviting me here today.

319
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,420
I understand your intentions,

320
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,460
but after all,

321
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,300
you have a wife.

322
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,100
Oh,

323
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,220
if this matter
is making you uncomfortable,

324
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,660
to be honest,

325
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
this marriage

326
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,340
has been

327
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
torture for me.

328
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,420
I've been trying to end it.

329
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,020
Don't worry.

330
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,240
I won't let you

331
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,580
become a mistress.

332
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,700
But what if your wife
doesn't agree to divorce?

333
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,500
I heard that

334
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,220
old comrades like you

335
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,740
often deceive young girls.

336
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,540
I don't know how others deceive them,

337
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,380
but

338
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,500
I promise

339
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,260
I'll never deceive you.

340
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
We've come this far.

341
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,540
She has to agree.

342
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,620
When you say things like this,

343
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,820
you don't sound like a leader at all.

344
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,340
Leaders can't always

345
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,940
have a serious face, right?

346
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,580
I'm a cheerful,

347
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,180
sincere,

348
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,420
and humorous leader.

349
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,620
In Fucheng,

350
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,730
only I am

351
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
worthy of you.

352
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,860
Secretary Bi,

353
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,460
show yourself.

354
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,140
You heard all that, right?

355
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,620
Secretary Bi received the same note

356
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
as the one you received today.

357
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Why would you do this?

358
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,100
I do want to go to Shanghai,

359
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,540
but I don't need you to do this.

360
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,740
Trying to bribe me with

361
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,420
this piece of paper won't work.

362
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,300
Bai Lan,

363
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
you shouldn't act like this.

364
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,020
It's too much.

365
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,460
You too!

366
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,140
- You jerk!
- Xiaolu!

367
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,180
Xiaolu!

368
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,700
You old jerk!

369
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,780
Lu Xiaolu! Lu Xiaolu!

370
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,300
- Xiaolu!
- Don't forget you just

371
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,140
got out of jail.

372
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,900
If you go back in,
you won't get out easily.

373
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,780
Xiaolu, let's go.

374
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm sick of arguing with them.

375
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,420
Let's go.

376
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,220
No wonder the police let us go so easily.

377
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,140
Now I understand everything.

378
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,740
Does it hurt?

379
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,220
I'm fine.

380
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,220
I should've killed those jerks.

381
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,420
After all that's happened,
don't you understand?

382
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,540
Even if we beat them up,
what will change?

383
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,540
Here, we can't change anything.

384

(New Year's Celebration)

385
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,060
Isn't that the banner from last year?

386
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,980
That character is missing a stroke,

387
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,860
and you're still using it.

388
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,500
The factory won't pay for a new one.

389
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,820
What can we do?

390
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,940
Well, at least fix that missing stroke.

391
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,780
I think

392
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,420
we should let the leaders see it first.

393
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,100
Attention, everyone.

394
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,580
At 2:30 this afternoon,

395
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,820
all staff are required in the auditorium

396
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,860
for the New Year's recognition ceremony.

397
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,980
There will be important announcements.

398
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,780
Attendance is mandatory.

399
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,980
Hey, this can't be about announcing

400
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,460
no year-end bonuses again this year,
can it?

401
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
I...

402
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,380
What do we do now?

403
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,830
(Gongyuan Golden Peacock Food Factory
New Year's Recognition Ceremony)

404
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,820
Another new year has arrived.

405
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,410
On behalf of our factory's leadership team,

406
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,600
I extend New Year's blessings

407
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,680
to all employees and their families.

408
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,980
Great!

409
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,340
At the same time, we thank
Secretary Hong for taking office

410
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,740
and leading our Fucheng Food Factory

411
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,180
to make new achievements.

412
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,220
Nice!

413
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,300
What's the use of blessings?

414
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,100
When are we getting our year-end bonuses?

415
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,100
Yeah!

416
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,980
Don't just give us

417
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,180
towels and soap again.

418
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,660
That's right.

419
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,100
- Right.
- Enough.

420
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,460
Everyone, please quiet down.

421
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,940
Let me reiterate the issue of discipline.

422
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,820
Discipline

423
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,500
is crucial for production.

424
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,060
For those who disregard factory rules

425
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,580
and act recklessly,

426
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,340
we must offer serious criticism.

427
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,420
Why criticize people during the New Year?

428
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
Stop talking nonsense

429
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,460
and just give us
our year-end bonuses already.

430
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,300
Unbelievable.

431
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,180
That's right.

432
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,740
It's ridiculous.

433
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,540
Now, let me call out names.

434
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,960
Kang Dali from the boiler room

435
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,900
Here!

in the cake department.

437
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,100
- Good for you.
- Wu Hongjun from maintenance

438
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,540
played cards during work hours.

439
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,300
Chen Guowei from maintenance

440
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,620
stole materials from the factory

441
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,220
and produced substandard products.

442
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,100
I didn't do it.

443
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,380
Li Guangnan from maintenance

444
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,420
engaged in sideline activities
without reporting them.

445
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,860
- You're smart.
- After the factory's deliberation,

446
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,980
the aforementioned individuals

447
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
will have 50%
of their year-end bonuses deducted.

448
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,140
The total amount is only 20.8 yuan.

449
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,220
And now 50% is deducted.

450
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,380
We may as well play more rounds of poker.

451
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,540
- Exactly.
- That's right.

452
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,500
Why bother working?

453
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,460
Also,

454
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,860
Lu Xiaolu from the warehouse

455
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,540
was absent without reason,

456
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,060
caused disturbances,

457
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,940
assaulted superiors,
and sought personal revenge.

458
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,100
He has done all kinds of evil deeds.

459
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,300
Therefore, 100% of his year-end bonus
will be deducted.

460
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,100
- Is Lu Xiaolu here?
- There are too many sacks today.

461
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,750
He went to shower and will be here soon.

462
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,700
Bring him here now.

463
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,740
We can't have him
coming here naked, right?

464
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,340
Everyone, quiet down.

465
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,780
Do you all see that?

466
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,460
Since Lu Xiaolu

467
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,900
was transferred to the warehouse,

468
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,860
he has continued to disregard factory rules

469
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,540
and act recklessly.

470
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,100
Although he escaped

471
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,620
imprisonment this time,

472
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,740
with his

473
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,940
current behavior,

474
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,260
his future prospects
are undoubtedly bleak.

475
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,660
I hope everyone
won't be influenced by him

476
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,500
and will learn from this lesson.

477
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,020
There's another person

478
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,940
who is even more

479
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,020
hopeless and stubborn

480
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,420
than Lu Xiaolu,

481
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,500
and that's Bai Lan from the medical room.

482
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,620
Bai Lan has

483
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,460
chaotic relationships,

484
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,180
and moral corruption,

485
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,940
bringing extremely negative impacts

486
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,100
on our factory and society.

487
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,260
After discussion by the factory leadership,

488
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,020
Bai Lan will be suspended indefinitely
without pay,

489
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,300
effective immediately.

490
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,260
Now,

491
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,780
those who were named,

492
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,820
come up and reflect deeply.

493
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,660
Did Director Bi instruct you to say this?

494
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Of course not.

495
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,700
What does this have to do
with Director Bi?

496
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,340
This conclusion was reached jointly

497
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,740
by our factory and the police station.

498
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,100
Let me ask you,

499
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,420
were you alone with Lu Dajiang

500
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,340
before his arrest?

501
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,460
Yes, I was.

502
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,260
So what?

503
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,100
Does that prove

504
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,220
my chaotic relationships?

505
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,180
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,860
Ding,

507
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
stop accusing others.

508
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,940
Talk about yourself.

509
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,140
What happened between you

510
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,260
and Afang on the balcony?

511
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,460
Yeah, tell us about that.

512
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,380
You...

513
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,100
I was wrongly accused.

514
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,020
Always blaming others.

515
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,220
- Xiaolu?
- He finished showering?

516
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,500
Esteemed leaders,

517
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,060
comrades,

518
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,580
I must reflect deeply.

519
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,940
Since being transferred to the warehouse,

520
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,140
I've been carrying bags

521
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,950
and reflecting on myself.

522
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,380
Indeed,

523
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,030
I shouldn't have skipped work
without reason,

524
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,420
insulted my superiors,

525
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,620
or resorted to violence to solve problems.

526
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,620
But what's worse

527
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,100
is letting the villains succeed,

528
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,030
allowing the wrongdoers to prevail,

529
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,460
and leaving the bullied without justice.

530
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,940
As the saying goes,

531
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,340
to err is human,

532
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,380
to forgive divine.

533
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,660
So today, I'm here

534
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,460
to rectify my grave mistakes.

535
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,540
- Lu Xiaolu!
- What are you doing?

536
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,300
- Come down here!
- Security!

537
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,300
What are you doing?

538
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Where's the security team?

539
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,540
What do you want?

540
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,220
Have some rest.

541
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,460
Let's go up and reflect.

542
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,740
What are you doing?

543
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,860
What are you doing?

544
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,820
Let me tell you,

545
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,620
if you stand with Lu Xiaolu,

546
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,140
I'll discipline all of you together.

547
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,500
I beat my superiors up,

548
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,940
punish me!

549
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,020
Sorry, leaders.

550
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,700
I not only harassed young girls

551
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,700
but also dated them during work hours.

552
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,940
Ding Dezhong,

553
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,980
what did your mother feed you?

554
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,700
I insulted you, so what?

555
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,300
I stole bricks from the factory

556
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
to build a house.

557
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,260

was actually me in disguise.

Don't worry.

584
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,220
Don't care about

585
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,300
the nonsense rumors.

586
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,740
You still have me,

587
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,580
Big Feet, and Little Pouter.

588
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,980
Even if you can't

589
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,020
got to Shanghai to study,

590
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,940
as long as we're here,

591
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,300
no one will dare to bully you.

592
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,260
Staying here

593
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,500
means forever under the oppressive rule

594
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,980
of Director Bi and people like him.

595
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,300
Only by going to a bigger world

596
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,140
will you find freedom.

597
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,580
I can't stand it here anymore.

598
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,420
Regardless,

599
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,340
I will leave this place.

600
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,500
Would you like to leave with me?

601
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,700
I...

602
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,300
Actually,

603
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,660
regardless of your answer,

604
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,440
I want to tell you that

605
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,320
although I don't want to stay in Fucheng,

606
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,820
meeting you here will be

607
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,020
the most unforgettable experience for me.

608
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,740
Dajiang,

609
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,100
it's almost New Year.

610
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,940
I came to see you.

611
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,100
How's your leg?

612
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,820
It's okay. The doctor said
it'll take one or two months to heal.

613
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,660
Good.

614
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,940
I hope you recover soon.

615
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,860
Dajiang,

616
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,220
did they find out your involvement

617
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,060
with the Hong Kong underworld?

618
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,060
I made all that up.

619
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,500
You made that up?

620
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,460
I worked on a cruise ship in Hong Kong

621
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,300
as a waiter.

622
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,100
It's just that everyone watched
too many Hong Kong movies

623
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,030
and thought
I was involved with the triads.

624
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,580
They were scared to death of me.

625
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,060
But I don't mind.

626
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,780
It saved me a lot of trouble.

627
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,980
Oh my.

628
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,020
So you haven't been involved in that?

629
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,740
I've been reflecting recently.

630
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,180
Let me tell you something.

631
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,460
When I came back from Hong Kong,

632
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,500
I had some money in my pocket

633
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,460
and thought I could make

634
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
something happen in Fucheng

635
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,060
and give you a better life.

636
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,540
But now

637
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,180
I can't even hold onto a skating rink.

638
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,500
So I understood one thing.

639
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,180
The factory will only get worse.

640
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,820
That's why you need
to think of another way out.

641
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,180
You're smarter than me.

642
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,460
Don't end up like me.

643
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,500
Dajiang,

644
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,300
if I can't come to see you often
in the future,

645
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,580
will you be mad at me?

646
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,620
Where do you want to go?

647
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
I haven't decided yet.

648
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,980
Just talking casually.

649
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,260
You are not talking casually.

650
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,380
If you want to stay in the factory,

651
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,420
you will either become like me

652
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,620
or like Ding Dezhong.

653
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,900
Who do you want to become?

654
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,180
Alright, time's up.

655
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,380
You're not like me.

656
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,820
You've gone to high school,

657
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,180
you're educated.

658
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,940
Anyway,

659
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,020
you need to go out and explore.

660
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,300
Alright.

661
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,420
When I get out,

662
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,820
if you're still here,

663
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,080
I'll beat you up.

664
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,500
Enough, time's up.

665
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,340
Did you hear me?

666
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,900
Hurry up.

667
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,980
Time is up.

668
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,020
Xiaoying,

669
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
when will that dish be ready?

670
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,860
Oh, right away.

671
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,620
Only one dish to go.

672
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,820
Xiaolu's favorite fried liver.

673
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,020
Xiaolu?

674
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Who said Xiaolu was coming?

675
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,460
Didn't you say you have a disciple

676
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,600
coming to spend New Year's with us?

677
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,520
Besides Xiaolu, who else could it be?

678
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,700
Master.

679
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,660
Master,

680
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
happy New Year.

681
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,300
Xiaoying, happy New Year.

682
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
It's him.

683
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,700
How come it's you?

684
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,380
Sorry, I'm late.

685
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,980
Why are you glaring at me?

686
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,580
Xiaolu is spending New Year's at home.

687
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,420
Why call him?

688
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,100
Big Feet isn't coming home this year.

689
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,940
Can't let him spend New Year's alone.

690
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,140
Stop drinking.

691
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,380
I...

692
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,300
Dad,

693
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,620
Mom,

694
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,060
how are you both?

695
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,940
It's New Year.

696
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,980
It's a bit cold in Fucheng this winter,

697
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,100
but don't worry.

698
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,020
I have enough money

699
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,420
and clothes.

700
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,420
This year, I was promoted,

701
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,340
and my salary increased
by a few dozen yuan.

702
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
I've grown up

703
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,100
and can support myself.

704
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,300
I just...

705
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,500
I just miss you all.

706
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,700
It's really nice.

707
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,660
Your dad's cooking has improved.

708
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,180
Not bad.

709
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
Thank you, honey.

710
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,460
Come on,

711
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
let's eat.

712
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,900
It's just that Dajiang

713
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,020
is not with us, every year

714
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,420
he used to come to our house
for New Year's Eve dinner.

715
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,460
I don't know how he'll have

716
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,620
New Year's Eve dinner tonight.

717
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,460
How about this?

718
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,180
What?

719
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,540
I'll find a picture of Dajiang

720
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,660
and put it here.
And I'll give him a red envelope.

721
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,940
It'll feel like we're eating together.

722
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,540
- Isn't that nice?
- What is wrong

723
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,900
with you?

724
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,700
Dajiang is just in prison.

725
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,180
If you prepare him tableware

726
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,060
and put his picture here,

727
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,180
it will look like

728
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,260
he's already...

729
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,340
Oh my goodness.

730
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,820
This is bad luck on New Year.

731
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
Alright, forget it, forget it.

732
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,660
Let's not do that.

733
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,940
- Look at your dad...
- Well...

734
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,020
Eat, Xiaolu.

735
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,740
Here,

736
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,620
Xiaolu.

737
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,260
I need to say something.

738
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,620
See what happened

739
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,060
to your cousin?

740
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,540
Is his situation good?

741
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,260
Even if

742
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,860
Ding Dezhong's wrong,

743
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,180
you guys can't confront him head-on.

744
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,140
It's like hitting a rock with an egg.

745
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,780
And

746
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,940
that Bai Lan,

747
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,300
why is she

748
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,340
suspended?

749
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,420
Just because she has a strong personality

750
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,580
and offended the leaders.

751
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,380
But she's a

752
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,180
university graduate.

753
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,340
She can find a job anywhere.

754
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,580
You're different.

755
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
You need to be more low-key.

756
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,620
You still have to stay in the factory,

757
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,780
right?

758
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,540
Dad,

759
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,940
Mom,

760
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,940
what if I can't stay there anymore?

761
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,820
What are you saying?

762
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,380
If you don't stay in the factory,

763
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,220
where will you go?

764
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
I can do maintenance work.

765
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,620
I can be an electrician.

766
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
I won't starve anywhere.

767
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,100
If all else fails,

768
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,220
I'll repeat a year

769
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,030
and try the college entrance exam again.

770
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,380
Hey,

771
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,620
why are you bringing up old things?

772
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,300
It was you
who refused to go to university.

773
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,690
And now you want to do that?

774
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,390
Let me tell you,

775
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,570
when you refused to repeat a year,

776
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,180
I was really upset.

777
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,020
I...

778
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,380
Alright,

779
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,420
let's stop.

780
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,140
I've

781
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,020
figured it out now.

782
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,380
I've talked with your dad.

783
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,900
Your job in the factory

784
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,420
is stable.

785
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,420
You can get a salary anyway,

786
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,620
right?

787
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,220
If you work harder

788
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,020
and be a shiftleader at maintenance,

789
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,100
find a good girl,

790
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
get married

791
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,780
and have some children,

792
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,140
your dad and I

793
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,540
will be so happy

794
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,260
and satisfied,

795
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,620
right?

796
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,660
Hey, Xiaolu.

797
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,860
Xiaolu,

798
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,500
your mom said this for your own good.

799
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,820
I know,

800
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,620
I'm just feeling stifled.

801
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,020
I want to go out for a walk.

802
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,420
Look at this child.

803
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,980
Where are you going?

804
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,510
Where are you...

805
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,660
Eat this.

806
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,380
Thanks.

807
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,100
It's still warm.

808
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,540
Oh, by the way,

809
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,980
after you finish eating,

810
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,820
use my card

811
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,180
to call your parents again.

812
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,380
I think you didn't get through just now.

813
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,220
It's not about the card.

814
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,260
I don't even have their numbers.

815
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,060
How can I call them?

816
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,980
Actually, when I was very young,

817
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,580
my parents divorced

818
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,140
and sent me to my uncle's house

819
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,060
because my cousin is mentally ill.

820
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,380
My uncle

821
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,140
agreed to adopt me.

822
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,580
If it weren't for my uncle,

823
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,540
I'd be homeless now.

824
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,220
I've known you for so long,

825
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,030
and this is the first time
I've heard you say these things.

826
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,940
Don't talk nonsense.

827
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,900
You don't know anything.

828
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,820
If anyone else knows it,

829
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,780
you're finished.

830
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,460
I didn't hear anything you said just now.

831
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,860
That's more like it.

832
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,540
Little Pouter,

833
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,460
there's something I want to tell you.

834
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,820
Qin Juan,

835
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,900
if you ever feel wronged again,

836
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,700
don't make a fake phone call.

837
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,540
Treat me as your phone booth

838
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,260
and let me be your family,

839
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,180
okay?

840
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,980
Did I say something wrong?

841
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,460
From now on, you'll have family.

842
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,300
Okay.

843
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,940
- Cheers!
- To you, Master.

844
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,820
Eat.

845
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,660
Eat.

846
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,300
Oh, silly kid.

847
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,900
Why are you not eating?

848
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,820
I'm not hungry.

849
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,820
Well...

850
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,020
Xiaoying, how about this?

851
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,460
I brought a lot of things

852
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,300
including firecrackers.

853
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,460
After you eat something,

854
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,400
why don't you go find Xiaolu
and set off some fireworks?

855
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,140
Really?

856
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,140
Go, go, go.

857
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,860
I'll watch the Spring Festival Gala.
Just go.

858
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,010
You should eat something first.

859
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,860
I don't want to.

860
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,180
- Let's go.
- I'll bring you a drumstick.

861
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,100
I don't want it.

862
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,820
Have some.

863
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,100
Why did you bring me here?

864
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,460
When I was little,

865
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,580
my cousin always brought me here to play.

866
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,820
The big bridge wasn't there back then.

867
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,620
When we were feeling down,

868
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,180
we'd look at the sky

869
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,420
and watch the seagulls.

870
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,380
It felt like we could fly as high as them.

871
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,360
When the college entrance exam ended,

872
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,220
it was also here

873
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,700
when he asked me

874
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,900
what kind of life I wanted in the future.

875
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,780
What did you say?

876
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,220
I said

877
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,260
I wanted to be like him.

878
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,060
But he told me

879
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,460
life isn't a movie.

880
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,820
It's much harder than that.

881
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,240
Now I think I understand a bit.

882
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,660
If you hadn't met me,

883
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,580
maybe you would have passed the exam

884
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,900
and become a university student.

885
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,620
But then I might have
skipped class every day,

886
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,820
got into trouble all the time,

887
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,860
and not studied well.

888
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,100
Maybe I would have

889
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,140
even dated

890
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,540
a pretty female university student.

891
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,660
But then I wouldn't have met you.

892
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,220
You're dreaming.

893
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,780
Actually, my cousin was right.

894
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,580
I couldn't become another him.

895
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,820
I should go out and explore the world.

896
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,900
Bai Lan, do you know?

897
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,580
Before I met you,

898
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,100
I never imagined my future.

899
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,300
It was your letter

900
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,060
that opened a new window for me.

901
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,900
It made me realize that

902
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,580
life could have a different path.

903
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,180
You told me that

904
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,020
you didn't come to Fucheng for me,

905
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,900
but I want to tell you that

906
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,060
the reason I'm leaving Fucheng

907
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,260
is because of you.
