a long time since

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,350
Fucheng had such good sunshine.

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,760
Your surgery went smoothly.

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,920
Heaven is congratulating you.

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,840
I did a great job giving birth to you.

My son is so handsome.

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,680
Your hair has grown long.

43
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,240
It needs trimming.

44
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,840
Do you remember

45
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,720
when you were little,

46
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,700
how much you loved it
when I trimmed your hair?

47
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,440
You were so quiet when I did it.

48
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,200
Of course I remember.

49
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,540
Mom,

50
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,680
once you're completely recovered

51
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,840
and we're back home,

52
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,240
my hair is all yours.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,120
You can style it however you want.

54
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,160
That sounds good.

55
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,920
Hey, listen,

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,940
help me with

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,540
the discharge procedures

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,920
tomorrow, alright?

59
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,120
Hey, I can't do that.

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,920
Mom, why are you rushing?

61
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,340
Your surgery has just finished,

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,020
the doctor said you need to stay
for observation.

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,900
You can't go home now.

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,680
But you said the surgery was successful.

65
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,720
- Mom.
- And I'm recovering quite well.

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,480
You can try this bed.

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,020
I can't sleep well on it.

68
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,100
If I stay longer,

69
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,500
my bones will fall apart.

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,780
Mom, please stop.

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,740
You can't leave now.

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,940
I want to go outside

73
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,140
- and enjoy the sun.
- No, you can't.

74
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,360
- Take me out to soak up some sun.
- Oh, Mom,

75
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,020
don't be difficult.

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,720
- I must...
- Hey, Mom, please.

77
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,210
What's wrong?

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,640
Dad, please talk to Mom.

79
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,540
It's okay, it's okay.

80
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,730
She hasn't had her post-op checkup yet,

81
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,460
and she wants to leave.

82
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,860
What post-op checkup?

83
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,960
Just wasting money.

84
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,300
I know what's going on

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,200
with my body.

86
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,340
Dad.

87
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,300
After all these years, don't you

88
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,440
know your mom's temperament?

89
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,560
Just let her be.

90
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,180
Look.

93
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,660
(Name: Bai Lan, Applying for
English Translation Position)

94
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,960
You want to work on a ship?

95
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,700
But it's all men on board.

96
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,660
They don't want women.

97
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,840
Women can't endure that hardship.

98
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,080
Manager, I can endure hardship.

99
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,400
I can do anything.

100
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,860
Whatever men can do, I can do too.

101
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,820
I still have to say no.

102
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,840
There's no precedent for this.

103
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,800
Do you need a doctor on your ship?

104
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,020
I studied medicine before

105
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,160
and worked as a factory doctor.

106
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,120
What is the problem?

107
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,340
We use

108
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,600
the finest bricks of black tea.

109
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,020
And cola,

110
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,520
no problem at all.

111
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,620
Manager,

112
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,080
let me help you check.

113
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,140
Thank you.

114
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,100
The black tea here

115
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,360
refers to the thing we call "red tea",

116
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,340
and the sparkling water

117
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,320
refers to soda water.

118
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,840
Your English is good.

119
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,240
I've been self-studying all along.

120
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,680
So, do you need
a translator on your ship?

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,760
After all, this is an international
shipping company.

122
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,200
Let me be honest with you.

123
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,380
From the captain to the crew,

124
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,460
everyone on this ship is male.

125
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,280
It's too dangerous for a woman.

126
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,540
Besides,

127
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
why can't you do anything else?

128
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,520
Do you have to work on the ship?

129
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,120
Actually,

130
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
I just don't really want

131
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,520
to stay in Shanghai anymore,

132
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,040
but for the moment,
I don't know where to go.

133
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,000
So I want to spend some time at sea.

134
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
But it's okay.

135
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,640
If there really
isn't a suitable position for me,

136
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,560
I'll look elsewhere.

137
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,500
Thank you.

138
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,540
If you're willing,

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,460
you could consider joining our company
as a translator.

140
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,880
We happen to need bilingual talents.

141
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,400
If you perform well,

142
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,520
there will be many opportunities

143
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,940
for overseas inspections in the future.

144
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,780
Really?

145
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,660
But let's make it clear upfront.

146
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,140
Our rule is to
have a one-month trial period

147
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,540
without salary before
becoming a formal employee.

148
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,000
How about a ten-day trial?

149
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,220
Fifteen days.

150
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,380
Okay.

151
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,520
Do you remember

152
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,000
this yellow sweater?

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,940
You gave it to me

154
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,080
when I first started at the factory.

155
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,100
Back then, when you

156
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,280
wore this sweater,

157
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,080
everyone would take a second look at you.

158
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,460
Of course.

159
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,980
Oh, this sweater was

160
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,740
what you wore when you won first prize

161
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,000
in the singing competition last time.

162
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,060
Are you talking about

163
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,180
when the leader personally awarded us?

164
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,640
The time we sang "Sing Sing So".

165
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,660
No, when we sang "Sing Sing So",

166
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,840
we were wearing red coats.

167
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,320
No,

168
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,680
it was this one.

169
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,060
You're remembering it wrong.

170
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,340
I wore the red coat.

171
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,980
I didn't forget. It was this one.

172
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,060
There is a photo.

173
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,560
- Let me find it.
- Where is it?

174
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,780
- Look.
- Look at you.

175
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,440
- You just don't believe it.
- Not the red one, no.

176
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
You've got it wrong.

177
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,660
It's this one.

178
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,580
Let me search in that room.

179
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,960
Just wait a moment.

180
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,480
You're mistaken.

181
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,420
What's wrong?

182
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,300
Come, come, get up!

183
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,320
Get up, get up!

184
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,740
Why are you so careless?

185
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,300
- What were you doing?
- I'm fine.

186
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,600
- Come on, get up.
- It's okay.

187
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,200
- Mom!
- Mrs. Lu!

188
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,820
What's wrong?

189
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,220
- It's nothing.
- It's okay.

190
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,340
- It's okay.
- Let me put on the shoe.

191
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,220
She slipped.

192
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,120
She just slipped.

193
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,180
Here.

194
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,660
What were you trying to get?

195
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,500
Come on.

196
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,580
Put her on the sofa.

197
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,420
On the sofa.

198
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Are you okay, Mrs. Lu?

199
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,380
Sit down, sit down.

200
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,280
I just...

201
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,940
I...

202
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,500
I was just

203
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,960
trying to get

204
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,840
Xiaolu's

205
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,940
Certificate of Merit

206
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,800
from that

207
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,920
red suitcase.

208
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,400
Mom, the doctor said
you need to rest well.

209
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,960
You should listen to him.

210
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,900
You can ask my dad to get it for you.

211
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,120
It's okay.

212
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
I've been lying on that

213
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,200
hospital bed for too long,

214
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,420
so my legs are weak now.

215
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,860
How can you say it's okay? You...

216
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,360
Enough, stop talking.

217
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,960
Since he came back from Shanghai,

218
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,360
he's been nagging nonstop.

219
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,440
Mrs. Lu,

220
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,340
look, I brought you some tasty treats.

221
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,700
You need to replenish your nutrition
after surgery,

222
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
so you'll recover soon.

223
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,000
Xiaoying is really thoughtful.

224
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,280
Oh, that's enough.

225
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,480
Enough for me.

226
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,220
Come on, eat.

227
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,620
Why are you all

228
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,840
staring at me

229
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,740
- like I'm a criminal?
- Alright, alright.

230
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,880
We won't stare.

231
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,680
I'll recover soon.

232
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,780
Xiaolu.

233
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,420
Mom.

234
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,260
This is

235
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,760
what I think.

236
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,600
If you feel really unhappy

237
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,040
working at this factory,

238
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,840
if you're not happy,

239
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,760
you can just quit.

240
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,960
It's no big deal.

241
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,960
You're still so young.

242
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,800
There are other ways out for you.

243
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,760
My son will be excellent.

244
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,920
I have always believed in this.

245
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,880
But I...

246
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,080
I also think

247
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,800
finding a girl you like

248
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,480
is quite important.

249
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,560
Having a good relationship

250
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,160
and starting a family,

251
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,800
then I would be at ease.

252
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,140
Actually, in Fucheng,

253
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,280
there are plenty of good girls.

254
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,260
You can surely find one

255
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,700
more considerate

256
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,860
and better than Bai Lan.

257
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,700
Isn't that so?

258
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,560
I think Xiaoying is quite nice.

259
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,880
I really like you.

260
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,260
Mrs. Lu,

261
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,540
I'm...

262
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm not with Xiaolu as you think.

263
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,320
Mom.

264
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,680
He's my father's apprentice.

265
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,480
My dad treats him even better than me.

266
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,720
I've always treated him
like a little brother.

267
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,040
Quick, call me sister.

268
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,180
Quickly.

269
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,860
Sister.

270
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,840
From now on, I'll rely on you.

271
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,980
Is that okay?

272
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,220
Auntie, don't worry.

273
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,440
I'll look after him in the future.

274
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,460
Look,

275
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,760
I have made another mistake.

276
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,100
If I had a daughter like you,

277
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,200
that would be great.

278
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,460
I've struggled so much,

279
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,760
but I haven't had a daughter.

280
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,280
What's good about sons?

281
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,320
They just cause trouble.

282
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,620
Daughters are always

283
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,280
the most thoughtful.

284
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,880
Brother and sister,

285
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,920
that's also good.

286
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,080
Both of you

287
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,880
must take care of each other.

288
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,160
You're not young anymore.

289
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,220
You should know

290
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,520
how to take care of your dad
in the future.

291
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,120
We've received the third call from Hong Kong
asking for an explanation.

292
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,680
Who will explain the situation?

293
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,960
Last week, after receiving a warning
about severe weather,

294
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,080
all ships on this route stopped.

295
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,480
But the storm ended yesterday.

296
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,300
It's been over 20 hours.

297
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,680
Why hasn't shipping resumed yet?

298
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,160
The passenger volume has surged,

299
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,680
causing congestion on the route.

300
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,080
Currently,

301
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,800
there's still a queue.

302
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,880
Both passenger and cargo shipping

303
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,080
serve people.

304
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,400
There are three days left.

305
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,920
I don't care what methods you use,

306
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,400
but this batch of goods must be delivered
within the contract period.

307
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,780
Manager,

308
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,640
I have a suggestion.

309
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,920
Go ahead.

310
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,140
I know cargo transportation

311
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,240
is Europa's traditional business,

312
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,840
and passenger transportation
is a new service

313
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,400
opened in Shanghai in recent years.

314
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,960
To build a good reputation
for the new business,

315
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,480
priority has been given
to open new routes.

316
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,360
This can be understood.

317
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,740
But is it possible

318
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,620
to integrate the two businesses?

319
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,880
This way, no one has to yield to anyone.

320
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,080
No one has to yield?

321
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,480
You want them to fight at the ports?

322
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,140
Because I found in the data
that the passenger

323
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,920
occupancy rate of the ferries
in the past two months

324
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,160
was less than 50 percent.

325
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,700
So, can't we use the remaining capacity

326
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,680
to carry goods?

327
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,080
You understand this?

328
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
I just happened
to read it in the newspaper

329
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
about the construction of the Zilan,

330
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,560
and I made a connection.

331
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,040
Also, this year coincides with
Hong Kong's return.

332
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,540
There will be more people traveling

333
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,420
for family visits and business.

334
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,920
The demand will increase.

335
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,260
If at this time,

336
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,980
we can do both businesses well,

337
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,000
we'll be seizing the market preemptively.

338
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,500
Alright.

339
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,260
Then I'll leave this batch of goods

340
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,360
for you to arrange.

341
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,980
If you don't do it well,

342
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,640
then your internship period will...

343
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,860
I'll definitely do it well.

344
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,900
I promise.

345
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,080
Wasn't this Hong Kong route
under your responsibility?

346
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,120
You came here
half a month earlier than her,

347
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,920
so how did she take over
as soon as she came?

348
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,040
Who knows?

349
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,820
She's from out of town

350
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,540
and wants to secure a stable job.

351
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,760
She's willing to do anything.

352
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,740
I also think so.

353
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,500
Xiaoying,

354
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,440
why are you going for blind dates?

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,340
What's wrong with that?

356
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,380
Can't I?

357
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,520
You are

358
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,020
not only beautiful

359
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,180
but also good at cooking.

360
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,900
You'll definitely find someone.

361
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,160
Why do you need to go for blind dates?

362
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,320
What's wrong with blind dates?

363
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,680
My dad and mom met through blind dates.

364
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,680
My dad loved my mom all his life.

365
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,580
Are you doing this

366
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,780
because of Xiaolu?

367
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,800
What are you saying?

368
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,120
Can't I pursue my own happiness?

369
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,100
Also,

370
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,040
what concern is it of yours
that I go on blind dates?

371
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,760
How is it not my concern?

372
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,860
I...

373
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,660
I understand now.

374
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,440
What do you understand?

375
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,760
You're the kind of weirdo

who can't find a wife for yourself

377
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,720
and can't stand others being happy.

378
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,900
That's why you went to great lengths

379
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,800
to fool me.

380
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,520
But I won't be fooled by you.

381
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,360
That's not true.

382
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,680
Oh, your orange juice.

383
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,400
You're not what I expected.

384
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,040
Oh, really?

385
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Aunt Dong said you're a college graduate.

386
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,200
I thought you were a bookworm.

387
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,640
You're also not what I expected.

388
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,860
Really?

389
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
What do you usually

390
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,320
like to do?

391
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,300
Cooking.

392
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,920
I enjoy exploring various recipes,

393
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,380
steaming, stir-frying,

394
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,420
sweet, spicy, meat, vegetarian.

395
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,260
I can do them all.

396
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,840
Just cooking?

397
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,960
Doesn't cooking count?

398
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,900
Then...

399
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,260
Isn't it almost like

400
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,080
finding a nanny?

401
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,800
Besides that,

402
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,240
what else?

403
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
Watching movies.

404
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,400
I like both Stephen Chow
and Jackie Chan's movies.

405
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,020
You're just all about fun and games,

406
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,080

407
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,120
Don't you usually read books?

408
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,800
Books?

409
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,060
Let's

410
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,400
cut to the chase.

411
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,040
Actually, I believe you can see

412
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,600
that with my conditions,

413
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,340
if my family hadn't arranged it,

414
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,000
I wouldn't have to
come out for blind dates.

415
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,280
Look at you.

416
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,560
If you were a bit prettier,

417
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,640
a bit slimmer,

418
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,360
had a better job,

419
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,720
and read more books,

420
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,480
then I might consider it.

421
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,320
But

422
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,520
with your current condition,

423
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't think you're my type.

424
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,360
Are you done?

425
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,460
Before judging others,

426
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,760
take a good look at yourself.

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,620

You seem like such a respectable person,

508
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,280
yet you were expelled from school
for theft.

509
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,120
Do you have anything to say about it?

510
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,740
No.

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,680
but only want to be a mere sailor.

513
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,760
I should have realized earlier.

514
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,800
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

515
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,740
Before coming here,

516
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,960
I also applied for many jobs,

517
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,640
but because of this reason,

518
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,020
no company was willing to hire me.

519
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,300
But you must know,

520
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,580
for companies like ours,

521
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,780
any dishonorable past

522
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,800

you want to dismiss me?

530

the goods successfully arrived
at the port this morning.

531
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,620
So, she came to Shanghai
after being fired from the factory.

532
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,680
First, she was fired from the factory,

533
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,200
and then expelled from graduate school.

It's urgent.
My mother's having a relapse,

569
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,800
and I need a car.

sorry, I forgot to tell you earlier.

574
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,840
The car went out of town
to pick up Secretary Hong.

575
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,120
Please think of another solution.

576
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,960

Mrs. Lu,

581
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,920
you have been

582
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,920
taking care of us

583
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,680
over the years.

584
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,200
How could you just leave like that?

585
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,920
I still have so much to say

586
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,840
and don't know who to say it to.

587
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,460
Sorry for your loss.

588
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,040
Sorry for your loss, Xiaolu.

589
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,220
What did Ding Dezhong do wrong?

590
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,980
I heard he embezzled money
from the factory

591
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,020
and used it

592
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,980
for usury,

593
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,000
but the usury company got taken down.

594
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,460
He is so greedy.

595
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
Yeah.

596
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,520
Was it you who reported me?

597
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,620
What do you think?

598
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,700
I kindly allowed Qin Juan to date you,

599
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,380
and this is how you repay me?

600
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,420
I never expected you to be

601
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,280
such an ungrateful person.

602
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,660
Didn't you also do the same

603
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,720
to Dajiang back then?

604
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,520
I learned from you.

605
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,580
- You...
- Enough.

606
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,420
Cut the nonsense.

607
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,260
Get in the car quickly.

608
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,880
Stay in prison and repent.

609
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,440
Need any help?

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,520
this is a photo of you in third grade.

and were model students,

624
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,640
but you were

625
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,400
awarded for saving the cinema
from a fire.

626
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,780
Dad,

627
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,780
have I always

628
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,120
been disappointing to you both?

629
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,440
Of course not.

630
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,160
Your mom was so happy

631
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,700
and told everyone

632
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,220
how amazing

633
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,140
our Xiaolu is.

634
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,300
She almost stuck this photo

635
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,400
on her forehead.

636
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,880
But,

637
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,520
during my mom's final moments,

638
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,880
I wasn't by her side.

639
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,600
Dad, do you think I'm slow-witted?

640
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,160
I should've realized how ill my mom was.

641
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,300
If I had known
how serious her illness was,

642
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,300
I would never

643
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,760
have stayed away.

644
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,320
I should've come back earlier.

645
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,060
Dad,

646
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,360
don't worry.

647
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,240
I won't let you

648
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,800
worry about me like before.

649
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,440
Mom would be relieved
if she could see this.

650
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,980
Alright,

651
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,620
time to say goodbye.

652
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,300
Are you sure

653
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,160
you won't do business with us?

654
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,700
Guangnan,

655
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,480
you know I'm not cut out for that.

656
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,160
Do you remember

657
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,840
during Chinese New Year

658
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,400
when people asked for their wishes?

659
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,120
Everyone shared theirs,

660
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,520
but I didn't dare say mine

661
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,020
because I was afraid

662
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,240
you'd all laugh at me.

663
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,840
What is it?

664
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,300
I hope that

665
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,680
one day

666
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,680
