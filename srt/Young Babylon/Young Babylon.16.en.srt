Lu Xiaolu!

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,440
Xiaolu!

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,670
Xiaolu!

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,060
Xiaolu!

29
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,420
Xiaolu!

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,290
You check there. I'll go up.

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,310
Okay.

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,910
Xiaolu!

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,420
Lu Xiaolu!

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,500
Xiaolu!

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,140
You mean he's been back for several days?

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
It's been seven to eight days, Master.

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,750
It's been over a week,

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,980
but he hasn't come back to the factory.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,170
Ask him

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,220
if he still wants to work at the factory!

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Master, I'm not sure how to ask.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,420
Master,

43
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,280
if it were me,

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,600
I wouldn't want to come back
to this lousy factory.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,440
Get lost!

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Master,

47
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,190
since he already came back,

48
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,420
why can't we find him?

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
So...

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,700
Dad! Dad!

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,950
Where's Xiaolu?

52
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,940
Something's happened.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,680
What happened?

54
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,230
Xiaolu's mom
has been admitted to the hospital.

55
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,170
He needs to be there.

56
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,160
What?

57
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,440
Is she hospitalized because

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,470
she missed her son too much?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
Stop guessing! Hurry up,

60
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,200
split up and find Xiaolu.

61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,760
- I'll stay here and keep watching.
- Alright, Master.

62
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,470
- Hurry up.
- Hurry, hurry.

63
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,310
Alright. Alright.

64
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,850
Did Xiaolu really come back to Fucheng?

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,890
He didn't even tell his parents.

66
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,170
Big Feet met him in a bookstore.

67
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,190
I went to his houseboat

68
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,030
and checked.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,890
He wouldn't even open the door for me.

70
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,010
He still hasn't forgiven you, huh?

71
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,770
I peeked through the crack in the door,

72
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,170
and he was lying there listlessly.

73
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,400
Why is that?

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,140
What happened between him and Bai Lan?

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,440
They were just fine

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,660
when we went to Shanghai.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
What's that sound?

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,280
Let's check.

79
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,050
Lu Xiaolu?

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,500
Why are you here?

81
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,500
What happened between you and Bai Lan?

82
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,310
Xiaolu,

83
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,570
I know you don't want to see me,

84
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,680
but I have something important to tell you.

85
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,450
Your mom is in the hospital.

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,520
It's okay. Don't feel burdened.

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,090
The bleeding has stopped,

88
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,740
but for a permanent solution,

89
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,090
she might need surgery.

90
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,890
Why didn't you come earlier?

91
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,430
The food factory
has been struggling this year,

92
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,350
and the medical insurance money
hasn't come through.

93
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,200
She kept taking medicine

94
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,450
and said she was fine.

95
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,870
So, she kept putting it off

96
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,710
until now.

97
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,300
If we had found out earlier,

98
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,530
maybe we could have grasped
the critical treatment period.

99
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,300
Now it has become
advanced pancreatic cancer.

100
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,970
She'll have to have a surgery
or wait for death.

101
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,310
Doctor,

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,090
what are the chances

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,300
if she undergoes surgery?

104
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,860
All surgeries have risks.

105
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,910
Even if the surgery goes smoothly,

106
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,430
every patient's reaction afterward

107
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,300
is different.

108
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,870
Doctor, we don't understand.

109
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,330
Can you give us your advice?

110
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,230
From a medical perspective,

111
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I would recommend the surgery.

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,970
But the final decision

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,210
rests with you.

114
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,720
If you decide on surgery,

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
it needs to happen soon.

116
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,770
How much will the surgery cost?

117
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,770
This surgery

118
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,180
requires a specialist
from the provincial capital.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,890
The cost is not a small sum.

120
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,910
You can negotiate with

121
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,060
your factory.

122
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,530
In theory, this should be

123
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,090
fully covered by public health insurance.

124
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
Okay.

125
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,640
Doctor, I'll go to the factory to inquire.

126
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,720
Wait for my message, okay?

127
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,870
- Sure.
- Okay, thank you.

128
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,090
- No problem.
- Thank you, thank you.

129
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,500
Dad, how is my mom?

130
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
Xiaolu.

131
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,390
Mom,

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm back.

133
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,060
Finally.

134
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,410
When did you come back?

135
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,740
You've lost weight.

136
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,840
Where did you notice that?

137
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,740
Where's Bai Lan?

138
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,210
I came back alone.

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,230
I heard you were sick,

140
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,620
so I rushed back.

141
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,400
If I weren't sick,

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,970
you wouldn't have come back to see me?

143
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,450
- Mom.
- Let me flick you.

144
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Come on.

145
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,740
Let me flick you.

146
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm fine,

147
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,460
just lie here for a couple more days,

148
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,140
and I'll be fine.

149
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,180
Go ahead if you are busy.

150
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,260
Don't worry about me.

151
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm not busy.

152
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,540
I'm back now,

153
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,660
I'll stay by your side

154
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,980
and not leave again.

155
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,580
What's wrong?

156
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,060
Did you have a fight with Bai Lan?

157
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,820
No.

158
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,460
We're fine.

159
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,700
She even said

160
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,620
she wanted to come back with me
to see you,

161
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,780
but she's busy studying

162
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,700
and couldn't make time.

163
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,060
I told her

164
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,900
that

165
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,980
you're okay,

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,660
and didn't let her come.

167
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,820
Go on.

168
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,320
Continue making up stories.

169
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
You are my own son,

170
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,740
and I can see right through

171
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,980
your mind.

172
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,420
Your eyes tell me

173
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,500
it's not that simple.

174
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,620
Just tell me about it.

175
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,900
Mom,

176
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,260
don't worry about this and that.

177
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,940
Just stay put and

178
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,100
get the surgery done.

179
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,300
As long as you are healthy,

180
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,340
I won't have any worries.

181
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,300
Okay.

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,460
Just hearing you say this,

183
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,340
I'm content as a mother.

184
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
But Xiaolu,

185
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,060
I've made up my mind,

186
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm not

187
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,260
having the surgery.

188
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,460
Why not?

189
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,900
Mom,

190
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,700
you must have it!

191
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,100
No.

192
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,100
Secretary Hong,

193
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,500
why isn't the factory reimbursing
my mom's medical expenses?

194
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,020
Xiaolu, calm down please.

195
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,860
It's not that the factory won't reimburse it,

196
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,900
we just don't have the money.

197
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,380
The Finance Department told me that

198
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,700
the medical insurance fund
has already been overspent,

199
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,260
and we can't find funds

200
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,740
from elsewhere.

201
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
Look,

202
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
I even bought some fruit

203
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,140
with my own money

204
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,140
to go visit

205
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,380
your mom.

206
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,420
I wanted to see if there were

207
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,820
any difficulties that needed solving.

208
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,060
Secretary Hong,

209
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,220
my mom's difficulty
is that she needs surgery.

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,060
She needs the factory
to cover the medical expenses.

211
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,320
- The surgery expenses...
- Lu Xiaolu,

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,820
get out and don't disturb
Secretary Hong's work.

213
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Get out!

214
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,660
Get off me!

215
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,180
Secretary Hong,

216
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,140
my mom has dedicated decades
to the factory,

217
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,300
you can't just stand by
and watch her die!

218
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,300
- I know.
- Lu Xiaolu!

219
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,260
You and your mom
colluded to fake illness,

220
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,890
submitting fake medical leave
to go to Shanghai

221
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,860
to hang out with Bai Lan.

222
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,100
You had no regard for discipline,

223
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,780
and your mom broke the regulations.

224
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,300
I haven't settled the score with you yet,

225
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,020
and now you dare come to the factory
and raise hell?

226
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,260
What are you trying to do?

227
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,300
Ding Dezhong, you should come at me!

228
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,140
This is between you and me.

229
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,740
You can punish me

230
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,220
or even fire me,

231
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,340
I won't say a thing,

232
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,820
just don't involve my mom.

233
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,340
These are two separate issues.

234
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,380
Don't confuse them.

235
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,380
Secretary Hong,

236
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,500
Lu Xiaolu has been

237
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,260
causing trouble repeatedly.

238
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,020
You used to protect him,

239
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,580
but letting him continue like this

240
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,300
undermines discipline.

241
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,180
Alright, enough, stop arguing.

242
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,620
Get out now.

243
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
Did you hear that?

244
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,540
Get out.

245
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,500
I meant you!

246
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,460
You get out!

247
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,740
But...

248
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
Oh, whatever.

249
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,740
Lu Xiaolu,

250
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,420
let's go.

251
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,700
Come with me to the hospital

252
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,380
and visit your mom.

253
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,700
Take this.

254
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,340
And we'll talk about the medical expenses.

255
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,220
Dad.

256
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,820
You have been back for days
but didn't come home.

257
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,260
Were you staying at Lu Dajiang's place?

258
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,460
Yes.

259
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,020
What is it?

260
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,460
Tired of this home?

261
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,780
No,

262
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,620
I just want some quiet time.

263
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,820
I understand.

264
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,820
Because you used to

265
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,180
study with Bai Lan there,

266
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,660
so there are her traces everywhere.

267
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,980
Actually, I don't want to go home either.

268
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,820
Because there are all your mom's traces.

269
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,860
Dad,

270
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,100
as long as Mom's surgery goes smoothly,

271
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,100
everything will be fine,

272
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,740
and we can go home.

273
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,180
After a few months,

274
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,060
you've grown up.

275
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,500
I have to grow up.

276
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,140
Everyone has to go through hardships.

277
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,820
The hardest part

278
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,420
is being mentally ready for the hardship.

279
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,660
Other things are easy.

280
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,140
Dad,

281
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,740
we have to get through this hurdle.

282
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
Yes.

283
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,620
We will definitely get through it.

284
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,820
Look at your mom's condition.

285
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,420
She's fine, right?

286
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,500
We'll get through it for sure.

287
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,620
I asked the doctor.

288
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,300
If the provincial experts
perform the surgery,

289
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,980
it'll cost around 2,000 yuan.

290
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,580
And this is 2,000 yuan.

291
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,500
Is this all the money we have at home?

292
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,540
We also have over ten IOUs,

293
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,180
totaling more than 5,000 yuan.

294
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,620
The factory's performance
has been poor these past few years,

295
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,940
and your mom, she's so kind-hearted,

296
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,740
always helping

297
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,980
others in need.

298
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,500
Our money is all tied up.

299
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,460
I'll pull a long face

300
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
and try to collect those debts.

301
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,540
This way, we'll have enough

302
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,060
for medical expenses,

303
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,540
hospitalization fees,

304
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,540
and the surgery.

305
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,380
Listen, Xiaolu,

306
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,060
don't worry about the surgery fees.

307
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,620
Take care of yourself,

308
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,220
so your mom will be at ease.

309
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,340
Oh, by the way,

310
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,700
when Secretary Hong
went to see your mom today,

311
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,100
he told her that

312
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,780
the warehouse leader
didn't want you there anymore.

313
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,940
Your mom pleaded with Secretary Hong

314
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,940
to find you another place.

315
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,060
In the end, Secretary Hong agreed to

316
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,460
assign you to the Security Department.

317
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,900
Report there tomorrow.

318
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,740
Okay,

319
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,420
got it.

320
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,060
We must have confidence.

321
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,820
Your mom will definitely get better.

322
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,540
Come on, Xiaolu.

323
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,900
Xiaolu,

324
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,620
smile.

325
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,740
Stop moping around all day.

326
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,980
(Gongyuan)

327
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,100
Where are you going?

328
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,180
I have taken leave

329
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
and am going out.

330
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Alright,

331
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
go ahead.

332
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,540
What are you doing standing here

333
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660
like a statue?

334
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,660
Someone was going out

335
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
but you turned a blind eye?

336
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,380
You are standing guard here!

337
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,780
What?

338
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,220
Are you unhappy about this?

339
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
I found you an easy job to do

340
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,940
for your mom's sake.

341
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,540
You...

342
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,940
You don't have to
worry about anything at work.

343
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,620
And after work, just keep an eye out.

344
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,420
Don't let anyone

345
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,020
steal our socialist fruits

346
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,740
and clear out our factory.

347
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,180
You're just nodding along, aren't you?

348
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,620
Did you really understand what I said?

349
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,700
You need to pay attention

350
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,780
and not let our factory fire you for good.

351
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,300
Got it?

352
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,660
Understood.

353
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,860
Alright, stop suffering here.

354
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,740
Take this and come with me.

355
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,180
I don't know how it happened

356
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,780
but Ding Dezhong got bitten by a dog

357
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,260
when he was wandering around the factory

358
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,420
last night.

359
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,260
That is such a trouble.

360
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,900
Why didn't that dog finish him off?

361
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,860
This is truly unsettling.

362
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,820
Let's go catch the dog.

363
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,380
Come on.

364
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,620
Why are you still standing there?

365
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,980
- Is everyone here?
- Oh, yes.

366
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,020
Let's have Director Ding say a few words.

367
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,860
No, take it away.

368
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
A stray dog biting someone
is no small matter.

369
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,740
It doesn't matter if it bit me,

370
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,340
but if it had bitten Secretary Hong

371
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,220
or an inspecting leader,
what would we do?

372
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,220
It would affect

373
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,780
our factory's future development plans.

374
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,020
Yes, yes,

375
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,860
Director Ding makes a good point.

376
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,180
Thanks to this being
just an ordinary stray dog.

377
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,580
What if it

378
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,700
had rabies?

379
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,900
We need to be prepared.

380
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,620
If that dog had rabies,

381
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,780
Director Ding,

382
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,620
you wouldn't have many days left, right?

383
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,460
I heard it's incurable.

384
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,340
When people die of it,

385
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,740
it's terrifying.

386
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,620
Don't talk nonsense.

387
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,620
Director Ding might lose control
and bite you.

388
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,260
Cut out the nonsense!

389
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,820
Look at all of you.

390
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,740
Get into position.

391
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,860
Listen to me, pair up and catch the dog.

392
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,290
If it comes near, strike it down.

393
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,900
What if we get bitten?

394
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,340
Don't worry, even if we die,

395
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,500
Director Ding will be there with us.

396
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,620
What's with this attitude?

397
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,540
Go, go, go!

410

413
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,860
Catch it!

414
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,860
It ran towards the skating rink!

415
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,900
You guys, chase after it!

416
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,740
Where's the dog?

417
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,100
Xiaolu, hurry.

418
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,300
It ran towards the skating rink.

419
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,740

What are you doing, Niu?

423
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,540
I wanted to ask you.

424
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,420
Why are you after Lu Xiaolu?

425
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,660
Do I have to report to you?

426
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,860
Let me tell you,

427
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,900
stay in your repair team

428
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,140
and mind your own business.

Ding Dezhong,

430
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,540
when I joined the factory,

431
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,180
you were still wearing open-crotch pants.

I know all about you.

433
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,020
Let me remind you,

434
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,740
don't make me expose all your

435
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,620
dirty deeds and tangled accounts

436
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,260
in the factory.

437
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
What dirty deeds?

438
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,420
You think you can threaten me?

439
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,260
I warn you,

440
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,900
if you dare touch my apprentice,

441
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,260

and deal with the likes of you.

446

I won't lower myself to your level.

This way!

448
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,660
Stay away from my apprentice.

449
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,740

please don't be sad.

568
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,300
Now that Xiaolu is back,

569
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,860
you should be happy.

570
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,100
What do I have to be happy about?

572
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,620

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,660
I

574
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,220
read a book before

575
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,500
that talked about

576
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,100
two types of distance

577
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,380
between people,

578
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,060
spatial distance

579
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,980
and temporal distance.

580
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,180
Xiaolu and Bai Lan

581
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,940
have spatial distance now.

582
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,660
Don't worry,

583
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,180
as the temporal distance lengthens,

584
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,180
just wait and see.

585
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,180
What do you take me for?

586
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,540

no one likes me,

No, it's not like that.

590
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,580
Xiaolu and Bai Lan broke up

591
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,940

Good dog.

Xiaolu?

622
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,420
Bai Lan,

623
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,100
Lucky's injured.

624
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,820
Can you help me take a look?

625
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,820
Let me see.

626
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,660
The wound is festering.

627
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,740
Xiaolu.

628
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,620
Xiaolu.

629
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,820
Dr. Tian,

630
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,980
Lucky is injured.

631
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,340
Could you take a look, please?

632
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,020
I would like to,

633
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,860
but the problem is

634
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,980
the factory won't reimburse
medical expenses,

635
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,300
so the workers all took it out on me,

636
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,780
taking everything away.

637
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,740
I couldn't stop them.

638
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,260
Now I don't even have

639
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,980
a bottle of alcohol
or a pack of cotton swabs.

640
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,180
So I'm afraid...

641
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,460
I understand.

642
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
I'll try another place.

643
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,220
Is Bai Lan doing well over there?

644
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,380
Do I even need to ask?

645
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,260
Of course she's doing well.

646
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,500
She's in Shanghai,

647
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,660
pursuing her master's degree.

648
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,260
By the way,

649
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,740
how's your mom doing now?

650
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,740
She's in the hospital.

651
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,660
She'll have a surgery
in a couple of days.

652
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,580
Good.

653
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,500
That's good.

654
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,620
To be honest,

655
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,380
Chairwoman Zhao has been good to me,

656
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,580
but this time,

657
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,540
I couldn't really help.

658
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,780
As a doctor,

659
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
it doesn't sit well

660
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
with me.

661
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,980
Xiaolu,

662
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,660
make sure to keep all the documents safe.

663
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,740
Who knows, maybe the factory
can cover it one day,

664
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,020
right?

665
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,020
Alright.

666
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,860
- I'll head off now.
- Okay.

667
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,740
(Medical Room)

668
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,140
I heard

669
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,100
you have a dog.

670
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,420
I came to see what breed it is.

671
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,700
Here.

672
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,380
I can't tell the breed.

673
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,460
I didn't want to come.

674
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,100
Little Pouter forced me to.

675
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,420
The dog is injured?

676
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,780
Yes.

677
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,500
Does it need treatment?

678
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,620
Yes.

679
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,940
If you're short of money...

680
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm not.

681
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,860
Do you want to hear about

682
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,580
the business I'm in now?

683
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,180
No.

684
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,220
I'll tell you about it.

685
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm not interested.

686
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,260
Okay,

687
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,460
you've seen the dog.

688
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,940
If there's nothing else,

689
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,580
you should leave now.

690
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,420
What are you doing, Lu Xiaolu?

691
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,140
Bai Lan dumped you,

692
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,940
but you shouldn't take it out on me.

693
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,260
What are you trying to do?

694
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,380
What am I trying to do?

695
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,060
Look at you now!

696
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,500
You are like a ghost.

697
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,340
Is Bai Lan

698
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,700
really worth it?

699
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,620
Maybe she's already forgotten about you.

700
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,380
Whatever.

701
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,660
Lucky,

702
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,100
do you think

703
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,180
she's doing well now?

704
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
What?

705
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,820
You really dropped out of school?

706
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,100
To be precise,

707
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,140
I was advised to leave.

708
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,340
They were going to expel me,

709
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,700
but the professor was kind enough

710
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,380
to ask me to leave voluntarily.

711
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,300
Bai Lan,

712
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,580
although we haven't known

713
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,500
each other long,

714
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,340
I quite admire you.

715
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,180
Do you know that?

716
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
I felt that

717
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,820
you are a girl

718
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,180
who knows what she wants.

719
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,740
But on this matter,

720
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,460
what exactly are you thinking?

721
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,620
In life,
you have to try a few things blindly

722
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
to understand the importance
of giving your all.

723
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,700
You could also understand this

724
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,220
as self-comfort.

725
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,140
Self-comfort...

726
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,620
What about your future?

727
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,820
What will you do?

728
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,540
That's why I came to you.

729
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,580
Do you have any

730
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,500
suitable work for me?

731
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,940
Miss Bai,

732
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,020
you know that

733
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,180
modeling is

734
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,740
a competitive industry.

735
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,260
Your education
was your label and capital.

736
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,500
I understand.

737
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,900
If there's a suitable opportunity
in the future,

738
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,060
please think of me.

739
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,580
Oh, by the way,

740
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,900
you really turned Mr. Huang down?

741
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,500
What a great opportunity.

742
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,140
500 yuan a day

743
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,060
for the Italian jewelry series.

744
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,380
So many girls would

745
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,660
jump at this chance.

746
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,060
Can't you reconsider?

747
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,620
I already said, it's the rule.

748
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,100
Besides the surgery fee,

749
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,460
you should also pay the deposit,
2,000 yuan.

750
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,340
Doctor, you didn't mention

751
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,860
the deposit last time.

752
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,060
If the food factory could reimburse,

753
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,580
then that's not your concern.

754
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,140
But the factory won't reimburse now,

755
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,060
so you have to cover it yourselves.

756
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,100
It's simple logic.

757
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,060
Don't you understand?

758
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,820
I do understand,

759
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,860
but I can't come up with

760
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,140
that much money right now.

761
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,900
This money is for the hospital,

762
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,380
not my pocket.

763
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,220
Besides, the specialist

764
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,940
only comes once a month.

765
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,220
If you don't pay
before the end of tomorrow,

766
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,780
you'll have to wait until next month.

767
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,980
No, doctor,

768
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,820
my wife can't wait.

769
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,100
You said the sooner the surgery,

770
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
the better the chance.

771
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,620
What should I do?

772
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,700
Yes, I said that,

773
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
but I can't grant your request.

774
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,940
For such a serious illness,

775
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,060
hospitalization fees, surgery fees,

776
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,620
and miscellaneous medical expenses

777
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,050
probably amount
to over ten thousand yuan.

778
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,060
I understand.

779
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,580
If you can't afford it,
there's nothing I can do.

780
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,420
Doctor, doctor,

781
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,260
please help me, okay? Doctor!

782
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,580
Hello, may I speak to Ms. Tao?

783
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,780
Just tell her it's Xiaolu.

784
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,620
Ms. Tao is away on a business trip?

785
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,020
Thank you.

786
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,460
Sorry to bother you.

787
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,100
What?

788
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,660
Do you have a solution?

789
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,580
Xiaolu!

790
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,180
What's the matter?

791
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Li Guangnan wants to see you.

792
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,780
Why would he want to see me?

793
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,820
You'll find out when you see him.

794
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,540
Take it easy.

795
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,420
Xiaolu,

796
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,220
are you here for Mr. Li?

797
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,820
He's busy inside.

798
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,380
Mr. Li, huh?

799
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,180
Xiaolu,

800
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,880
we're working for Mr. Li now

801
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,060
just like we did for Dajiang.

802
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
You are here.

803
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,860
You wanted to see me?

804
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,260
Yes.

805
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
I heard your mother is ill

806
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,180
and needs money for surgery.

807
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,380
Why didn't you come to me?

808
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,980
You're running a small business.

809
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,300
How much money do you have?

810
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,820
How much do you need?

811
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,660
Five thousand.

812
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,060
That's not a big amount.

813
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,300
You don't know, Lu Xiaolu.

814
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,100
My business is doing really well now.

815
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,060
As soon as I open the door to my shop,

816
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,900
money pours in every day.

817
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,060
When do you need it?

818
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,940
Before tonight.

819
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,540
Stop pretending.

820
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,220
I can figure it out.

821
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,900
You really underestimate me.

822
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,100
I happen to have a sum of money.

823
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,300
I was thinking of investing in stocks.

824
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,700
If you urgently need it,

825
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,300
I'll lend it to you first.

826
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,580
Can you give it to me tonight?

827
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,500
Not tonight,
but I can give it to you tomorrow.

828
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,140
Tomorrow is too late.

829
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,700
If not tonight,

830
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,920
my mother's surgery
will be postponed for a month.

831
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,340
Okay.

832
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,100
Here.

833
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,580
Write me an IOU.

834
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,900
I'll give you the money.

835
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,940
Stop drinking.

836
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,420
Where did this money come from?

837
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,620
Don't ask.

838
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,340
No, you have to tell me.

839
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,100
We didn't make that much money
from our business.

840
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,300
Where did this money come from?

841
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,700
Talking about the money?

842
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,140
I have to thank your uncle.

843
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,700
My uncle?

844
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,460
He is not that kind-hearted.

845
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,460
Do you know how much money

846
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,540
Xiaolu's mom needs for the surgery?

847
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,420
Do you know

848
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,900
that Xiaolu's dad went to the factory
to ask for money

849
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,060
and didn't get a single penny?

850
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,100
He was kicked out.

851
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,580
How can I just stand by and watch Xiaolu

852
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,180
be driven to his death by money?

853
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,380
Don't change the subject.

854
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,700
My uncle doesn't have that much money.

855
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,820
Where did the money come from?

856
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,580
I don't want to owe him anything.

857
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,620
What do you owe him?

858
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,340
Your uncle is so nice.

859
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,700
For Xiaolu's mother's surgery money,

860
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,140
I went to borrow money from him.

861
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,140
Your uncle introduced me

862
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,660
to a boss who does usury business.

863
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,380
The coincidence is that

864
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,740
your uncle also invested in that company.

865
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,620
Twenty percent of the interest

866
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,460
I pay for the money

867
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,420
goes to your uncle.

868
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,380
What do you think?

869
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,500
He's just a wage earner.

870
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,300
Where would he get that much money?

871
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
Of course, he doesn't have it.

872
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,740
But he can cook the books.

873
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,180
He moved all the medical insurance money

874
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,220
from the factory.

875
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,980
It's impossible.

876
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,700
Although my uncle has done

877
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,500
a lot of bad things,

878
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,540
he shouldn't have the guts.

879
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,900
That's Ding Dezhong!

880
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,340
And the factory is collapsing,

881
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,460
what else does he care?

882
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,020
He's just looking for profit.

883
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,500
How did you know about this?

884
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,140
Secretary Hong has started auditing.

885
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,140
Your uncle is afraid.

886
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,420
He knew I had a sales channel

887
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,140
and wanted me to sell

888
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,930
all the expired food in the factory
to the countryside.

889
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,820
And he would take the money
and cover the accounts.

890
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,580
He even wanted to drag me down.

891
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,020
He wanted me to help him
do fake accounting,

892
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,980
and make more money.

893
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
That is what your uncle is like.

894
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,940
Did you do it?

895
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,580
I helped him sell the goods,

896
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,220
but I didn't do the fake accounts.

897
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,780
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

898
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,730
If you had told me, I would never
have let you get involved

899
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,400
in this kind of mess.

900
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,900
Do you think I wanted to do this?

901
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,140
He told me that if this thing succeeded,

902
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,820
he would agree to let you marry me.

903
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,740
Why didn't you...

904
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,900
Why didn't you

905
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,820
discuss it with me?

906
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,380
What do we do now?

907
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,180
We work hard to earn money

908
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,100
and pay back the debts!

909
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,700
The factory is trying to

910
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,900
figure out a solution.

911
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,900
You focus on getting well.

912
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,140
Oh, well...

913
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,260
Secretary Hong,

914
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,260
we know there are

915
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,180
difficulties in the factory.

916
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,580
- Hey, Xiaolu, give me the kettle.
- I understand.

917
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,180
- When can you reimburse it?
- Let me handle it, Dad.

918
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,100
Do you have the final say?

919
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,940
I am useless.

920
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,980
It's all thanks to you that your mom

921
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,900
had surgery this time.

922
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,500
Dad, what are you saying?

923
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,460
It's been hard for you these past few days.

924
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,140
Today, I'll take care of Mom.

925
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,260
You go home and have some rest.

926
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,260
No need.

927
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,940
I'm used to taking care of your mom.

928
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,140
I'm worried if you take care of her.

929
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,580
Take a break.

930
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,900
You don't have to do this.

931
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,740
Please.

932
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,220
- Have some fruit.
- Thank you.

933
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,180
Have some fruit.

934
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,940
- Here, Secretary Hong.
- Okay okay.

935
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,660
No problem.

936
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,580
What's wrong with you?

937
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,300
- Nothing.
- Hey.

938
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,460
Why are you crying?

939
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,580
I'm not.

940
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,020
Tell me.

941
