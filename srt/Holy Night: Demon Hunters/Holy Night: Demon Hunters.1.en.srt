1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:01:00,310
Observing Eunseo with a smart home system
and behavioral psychology camera - Day 34.

2
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:07,025
The cause of Eunseo's symptoms:
5 years ago, her single mother passed away
after a long battle with cancer.

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:15,492
This triggers a panic disorder, exacerbated by
the unfamiliar surroundings of the remote country house after moving in,

4
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,246
and stress from preparing for auditions
alone at home all day.

5
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,833
These factors appear
to have an impact simultaneously.

6
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,271
Okay, it's all done.

7
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,774
Ah, Manager Kim.

8
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,318
- Oh, Chief Choi, you're here?
- Ah, Sharon.

9
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,860
Bao ada?

10
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,404
Yes, here.

11
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:15,946
We have guests.

12
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
Halo.

13
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:18,782
Oh, yeah.

14
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,492
Please come in.

15
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:20,742
Okay.

16
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,454
Boss, Chief Choi has arrived.

17
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,334
Hm?

18
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:29,835
Yes.

19
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:36,758
A few days ago, my daughter Sujin
suddenly couldn't be contacted. I thought she was missing.

20
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,012
My Sujin wouldn't do something like this.
I'm sure something is wrong.

21
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,100
Our detectives have been searching,
and three people were injured by strange people.

22
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,185
Two died, one in critical condition.

23
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,189
As usual, it looks like
Mr. Kang has to step in.

24
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,902
If even a detective can get hurt,
then this is a serious problem.

25
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,197
That's why I asked Chief Choi
to bring me here.

26
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,326
Yes. Please don't worry too much. We will
investigate it thoroughly.

27
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,162
Uh, Manager Kim, please make a drink.

28
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,289
Ah, yes. Wait a minute.

29
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,831
Oh, no need to bother.

30
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,750
Uh, wait a minute. Oops.

31
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,628
Oh, sorry.

32
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,130
So, did you guys find anything?

33
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,300
We tracked the location from the photos
we got and moved immediately,

34
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,429
but all our men were paralyzed,
and we failed to save Sujin.

35
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:22,929
Here, Sharon.

36
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:24,723
Understood.

37
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,640
Thank You.

38
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,349
Thank You.

39
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:26,600
Oh, yeah.

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,190
Please come in.

41
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:33,482
Yes.

42
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,026
Want some water?

43
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,075
Please don't worry too much.
We will do our best.

44
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,621
Um, Chief Choi.

45
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,083
But can I really trust these people...

46
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,168
you can trust.

47
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,630
We may look strange,

48
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,424
but we are really experts.

49
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,470
Please, I beg you, find my Sujin.

50
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,387
We will try our best.

51
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,388
Ya. Ya.

52
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,639
Oh, yeah.

53
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,687
You brought cash again this time.

54
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,691
You didn't take some like last time, did you?

55
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,193
Hey, what do you think a detective is?

56
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,447
Hey, how many clients have
I brought to you?

57
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:22,781
Turn.

58
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,116
Here, give this to the kids.

59
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,619
Ah, what do you think a detective is?

60
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,538
What, don't like it?

61
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,914
Ah, the situation is serious now.

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,667
Many people died.

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,501
Okay.

64
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:34,709
This.

65
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,169
Children.

66
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:38,713
It's time for work.

67
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,244
Recently, in Seoul and across the country,
murders by unknown perpetrators have been

68
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,455
and violent crimes continue to occur

69
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,459
making many citizens live in fear.

70
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,713
Police suspect a mysterious group of people
and an organized crime syndicate

71
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,966
or even the violent criminals they influence
get involved,

72
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,219
and has formed a special violent crimes unit
to investigate.

73
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,556
However, as if mocking the law enforcers,
they even killed the police brutally...

74
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:38,273
In my 30 years as a police officer,
I have never seen a case as brutal as this.

75
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:44,112
Rumors about demons, devils, and the like circulated,
and unreasonable things kept happening.

76
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:50,994
Our police force
is simply unable to deal with it, Father.

77
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,080
The people blindly followed an archbishop
who summoned the devil,

78
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,126
and they use devil drugs
and devil powers to gain super powers.

79
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,297
Ordinary people
can't fight them.

80
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,926
That's why we really need that person.

I'm fine.

97
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,745
Not you, this guy.

98
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,167
Ah, the evil spirit hasn't
completely possessed him. He's still okay.

99
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:49,834
I'm grateful.

100
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,630
Um, Boss. Yesterday I was a bit dazed,

101
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,883
so I didn't get to record the ending.
How is it?

102
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,177
What do you mean? Want to wake them all up again?

103
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,639
No, I can't do that, but
I still feel like I need a proper cover.

104
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,974
You should have recorded it properly earlier.

105
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,644
That is true.

106
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,145
Chief Choi is on his way?

107
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,021
Yes, he is coming.

108
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:38,841
Thanks to you, Doctor, I am much better.
My shortness of breath has also improved. Thank you very much.

109
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,469
That's good to hear. But you still have to
keep taking your medication.

110
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,473
We will monitor your progress and
gradually reduce the dose.

111
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,226
Please check on him every two hours.

112
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,978
Yes, I will take action to stabilize the patient.

113
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,728
Okay, I understand.

114
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,538
Oh, Sister Catalina, it's okay.

115
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,750
I'm looking for money to build a
new orphanage for the church, so...

116
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,420
Hey, no need to thank me. It's okay.

117
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,381
Yes, yes. Okay, Catherine. Okay.

118
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,344
Boss, I already know which group
those kids from yesterday came from.

119
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:46,928
Hmm.

120
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,553
Which group?

121
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,429
Beelzebites.

122
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,682
Who is the leader of these bastards?

123
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,893
Ah, I haven't found their archbishop yet,
but I've planted an informant.

124
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,729
everywhere, so I think I'll see you soon.

125
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,232
Lately, high-class demons like Beelzebites
have been appearing more and more frequently.

126
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,402
I'm afraid there will be a bigger crisis.

127
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,115
I've seen them many times, but they're still
scary.

128
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,742
We are also afraid. They move
with demonic power, so they are very dangerous.

129
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,371
Don't be careless, always be alert.

130
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,582
Manager Kim, your future is bright.

131
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,294
If I?

132
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:27,760
What about me?

133
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,558
What about me? My future is bleak, right?

134
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,062
Oh my, it's so hot, damn it.

135
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:38,563
Excuse me.

136
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,314
Oh my God, get lost!

137
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh, sorry.

138
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,150
Who are you?

139
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,067
Is there anything I can help?

140
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,154
Can I meet the boss?

141
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,864
Yes, I am the boss.

142
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,407
What is it?

143
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,743
My little sister is seriously ill.

144
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,954
I had no other choice, so I came here.

145
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,873
Ah, did Chief Choi send you?

146
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,082
No, I'm Mar...

147
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,255
Could it be that Father Marco sent you?

148
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,596
Ah, sorry. I don't work
with people from that side.

149
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,681
I'm sorry.

150
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,894
My sister is in danger.

151
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,855
Please help me, I will do anything.

152
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,816
I also brought money. Here.

153
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:25,902
No, that's...

154
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,575
No, if your brother is sick,
you should take him to the hospital immediately.

155
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,410
You can find a psychiatrist.

156
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,870
I am a psychiatrist.

157
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:38,706
Hey, you...!

158
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:43,836
One...

159
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:54,889
This is a video recording of my sister.
Please make sure she receives it.

160
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,183
I beg you.

161
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,227

178
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,254
Can.

179
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,714
Wow, the air is so fresh.

180
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:29,942
Eunseo, it's time to eat, right?

181
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,529
Eunseo.

182
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,161
Eunseo?

183
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,454
Don't forget so quickly!

184
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,303
I'm a doctor too, so I didn't believe it
until I saw your sister myself.

185
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,306
Exorcism is officially
banned by the diocese, so that's why

186
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,769
I told you to go to my friend.
Of course, as a doctor, you also must not like it.

187
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:14,153
Devils, exorcism rituals,
I don't know anything about that.

188
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,534
I just want to save my brother, Father.

189
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,458
Hey.

190
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,917
Yes?

191
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,962
Sharon's wish?

192
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,464
It looks like it's in his room.

193
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:40,638
Boss,
do you want to watch the video of the beautiful girl who came yesterday?

194
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,556
Ah, that's it. What are you doing?

195
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:47,311
But if Father Marco sent him,
there must be something serious.

196
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,314
Don't ever mention
Father Marco in front of me again. Huh?

197
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,649
Sorry.

198
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,776
By the way, where is Sharon? I want to give you this.

199
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,527
I'm here.

200
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,822
Ouch! Surprised!
Ah, you came too.

201
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,699
Next time make some noise.
Kids these days, my goodness.

202
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,161
Here take it.

203
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:04,954
This.

204
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:05,871
This is your salary.

205
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,956
Why, thank you.

206
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,332
Good job.

207
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,458
Thanks.

208
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,668
This is also for this friend, you, him.

209
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,669
Hey, why is mine so thin?

210
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:18,384
Hey, Sharon works a lot, right?
She also does heavier things.
She even does shaman rituals, she's busy.

211
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,468
Who performs the shaman ritual? When?

212
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,345
Basically, he works hard, that's why.

213
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:21,554
Take it.

214
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,471
Ah, thanks.

215
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:22,930
Take it, take it.

216
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,099
Thank You.

217
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:25,933
Oh, these kids.

218
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,522
Ah, wait a minute. The demons and their worshippers.

219
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,483
more and more daring. Huh?

220
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,445
Now they are acting openly in the middle of the city.

221
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,739
And more people
are dying, right? Right?

222
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,200
So our work also
increases, right?

223
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,457
So, what if
our salaries were also increased slowly?

224
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,749
Oh, oh, oh.

225
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,843
Long time no see. It's been 10 years, huh.

226
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,637
You still look the same as before.

227
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,726
Of course. I've had this face since I was nineteen.

228
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,397
Still likes to joke around apparently.

229
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,320
A friend named Han Jeongwon came to see you, right?

230
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:24,241
I know you rejected him because of me,
but still, my friend's little sister...

231
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,745
I don't want to be involved
with you anymore, Father.

232
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,416
I know you still hold a grudge against me.

233
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:38,672
Many people became victims at that time,
and I also suffered a lot.

234
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:44,220
But at that time, I couldn't bear
to admit that Joseph did it.

235
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,804
The Joseph we know is gone.

236
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,058
Our innocent children and

237
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:53,687
The sisters were all killed
by the demon Lucifer, who still exists.

238
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,691
The devil you raised.

239
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:03,656
I prayed with regret and tears.
God's will...

240
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:11,997
Our children, all our children
died! What is God's will?

241
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,836
Even if you can't forgive me,
can you help my friend?

242
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,027
I came to say thank you.

243
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:48,325
If it wasn't for Sharon,
I wouldn't even have seen my son's face one last time.

244
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,912
If only we had come a little sooner...

245
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:57,293
No. Thanks to you, we were able
to find my son's body and

246
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:04,425
soothe his soul.
I am very, very grateful.

247
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:50,971
This is Sharon.

248
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,979
Seven years ago, Boss saved
our lives from the demons, remember?

249
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:10,282
At that time, Boss saved Sharon,
me, and Sister Catalina from Lucifer.

250
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:25,297
If the Boss hadn't helped us,
we would have died.

251
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,717
What else do we have to fear?

252
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,932
That girl named Eunseo, let's help her.

253
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,521
I really want to help that teacher too.

254
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,199
Eunseo's Observation, Day 34.

255
00:24:53,325 --> 00:25:00,249
The cause of Eunseo's symptoms:
5 years ago, her single mother passed away
after a long battle with cancer.

256
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:08,966
This triggers a panic disorder, exacerbated by
the unfamiliar new surroundings of the country house after moving.

257
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,138
And also the stress of preparing for the audition
alone at home all day.

258
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,600
These factors appear to have
an impact simultaneously.

259
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,904
Eunseo, it's time to eat, right?

260
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,866
Eunseo.

261
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,623
Eunseo? Don't forget that so quickly!

262
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:00,684
Leave it.

263
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,199
Yes, emergency 119.
Yes.

264
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,203
Forgive me.

265
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,033
Recently, victims among the police and

266
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,787
civilians due to mysterious groups
increased very rapidly.

267
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,665
So far, 30 police
have died while on duty,

268
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:57,254
and the number of citizens missing or killed
is too many to count.

269
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,338
Manager Kim.

270
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,382
Are you... that mysterious group...

271
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:02,426
Yeah, Bos.

272
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,014
Please show the video.

273
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,173
Hellfire descended from the sky!
These devils

274
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:45,093
throwing people
into the abyss of hellfire!

275
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:05,906
Brother...

276
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,674
Despite receiving various treatments,
Eunseo's abnormal behavior continued.

277
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:32,349
It's my fault for
not taking good care of it.

278
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,647
This, look.

279
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,902
I found another video.
There is a bigger problem.

280
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,363
Thank you very much.

281
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:51,993
A landlord has to do that if he wants to rent it out.
But our Mr. Gapsu is not like that.

282
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,792
Ah, but I've already cleaned most of the stuff.
But the big stuff,

283
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:05,298
while I keep it in the warehouse first.
Lots of dust, and too many things.

284
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,969
It's finished?

285
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,430
Yes. CCTV and
smart security system inspection is complete.

286
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:12,889
Look at this.

287
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:23,066
It seems like what happened to Miss Eunseo
also has something to do with Archbishop Lucifer.

288
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,487
Joseph.

289
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,368
There is Bao, who grew up with us in the orphanage,

290
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,038
and a son named Joseph,
three years his junior.

291
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,750
The late Sister Angela raised them
as her own children.

292
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,504
Both of them are among the chosen children.

293
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:51,094
Since childhood, Bao, as his name suggests,
has had the strength and physique of a rock.

294
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:57,851
And Joseph had the power to cast out
demons from human bodies and save them.

295
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:03,565
The other children were afraid of Joseph
and ostracized him,

296
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:10,197
But Bao always protected Joseph,
and they were as close as siblings.

297
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:16,995
Joseph took the path of an exorcist father,
and Bao, after leaving the orphanage,

298
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:22,667
making money with his fists in the underworld,
always taking care of the orphanage and Joseph.

299
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:29,758
Bao comes to the orphanage every Christmas...
15 years ago, on that day, Joseph

300
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,930
summoning the devil, and Sister Angela

301
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:40,143
and all the children were killed,
and he disappeared.

302
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,923
Bao, who was thought to have died at the time,
miraculously survived.

303
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,510
Since then, Bao, because of the guilt of not being able
to save the people who were like family,

304
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,138
and because of the desire for revenge,

305
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,767
start hunting down the missing Joseph
and exterminating the demons.

306
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:33,173
At that time, Joseph tried to absorb
human life energy to
increase the evil power within himself.

307
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:38,970
Stupidly, I didn't want to believe
that Joseph was that kind of person.

308
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,477
So I couldn't tell the truth
about the incident to the diocese.

309
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:50,273
Meanwhile, Joseph disappeared.
Later, Bao found out,

310
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:56,613
and the reason he refused your request
was probably because of me.

311
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,252
Halo?

312
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,128
Yes.

313
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,714
This is CEO Kang Bao from Holy Night.

314
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,549
If you have time, let's meet for a while.

315
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,477
The exorcism ritual will be led by Sharon here.

316
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,689
And Manager Kim will help you.

317
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,112
I couldn't tell you before, but... in cases like this

318
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,115
creatures called demons
and their worshippers can appear

319
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,118
around Eunseo anytime, anywhere.

320
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,162
So I have to stop those bastards.

321
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,668
This friend has a special ability
to find demons.

322
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,753
He knows how to fight them better than anyone.

323
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,801
How about you make your eyes white for a while?

324
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,511
I'll show you.

325
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,387
Not possible now.

326
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:03,805
Correct.

327
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:10,145
This job is quite dangerous.
Miss Eunseo and you, ma'am, could be in danger too.

328
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,397
Well, we always risk our lives for this.

329
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,024
But, do you still want to try it?

330
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:26,119
Yes. If I can save my sister's life,
I would do it.

331
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:32,500
Our lives are also at risk, but...
Anyway, Manager Kim, prepare an explanation.

332
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:44,345
What is certain is that there is a demon
residing within Miss Eunseo.

333
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,974
Why did this happen to our Eunseo?

334
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,310
Have you ever let a stranger into your house?

335
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,813
No. It's a remote place,
so no strange people come by.

336
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:54,105
Look at this.

337
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,610
It seems like they summoned a devil
through Miss Eunseo's body.

338
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,573
Until we find the sign, we can't be sure
who they are.

339
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,076
They always seem nice and
are always around us.

340
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,289
They are called worshippers. They worship the devil,

341
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:15,543
obeying the devil, hurting people,
and spreading evil.

342
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,755
Especially the guards among them,
trained like soldiers,

343
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,759
they torture anyone who gets in their way.

344
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,261
The so-called demons are the bishops
who lead each region.

345
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,557
They were no longer human,
but almost like demons.

346
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,229
They select victims according to
the archbishop's orders and lead all summoning rituals.

347
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,398
Why our Eunseo?

348
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,194
For thousands of years, they have used
people like Miss Eunseo, who was injured

349
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:45,573
and have a pure soul, as a medium
to summon demons and create their world.

350
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,493
Anyone can be a target.

351
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,580
I have to meet Eunseo.

352
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,584
Eunseo.

353
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,712
Are you feeling a little better?

354
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,050
Can you hear my voice?

355
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,387
Yes.

356
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,473
This woman came to help you.

357
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,309
Can you talk to me for a minute?

358
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,270
Yes.

359
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,608
Besides me, is there anyone else who talks to you?

360
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,362
There is.

361
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,366
Who's that?

362
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,284
I don't know.

363
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,579
I can't say.

364
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,292
Can I talk to that person?

365
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,044
No.

366
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:41,838
Why not?

367
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,133
Scary.

368
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:53,182
If I talk to him and he responds, he will come out of your body.

369
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,436
You want him out too, right?

370
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:56,853
I...

371
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,523
I am very scared.

372
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,696
I'll start.

373
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,579
Who are you?

374
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,791
Reply me.

375
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,044

376
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,588
Answer!

377
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,109
Don't hide behind the child, I replied.

378
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:45,943
Who are you?

379
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,996
Why are you doing this to me?

380
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,001

418
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,084
Jeongwon! Are you okay?

419
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,421
Boss, are you hurt?

420
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:38,713
Yes.

421
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:44,552
The devil inside Eunseo is too deep.
I don't know who it is.

422
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,223
Looks like we should end this
at home where it all began.

423
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,685
If he stays in the hospital,
Eunseo and the others will be in danger.

424
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,813
Yes. Let's do that.

425
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,399
Come on, hurry up. There's not much time.

426
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:24,383
Eunseo.

427
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,680
Hang on a little longer, okay?

428
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,708
Ouch...

429
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,377
Ah, I don't know where
they'll appear from, damn...

430
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,739
It's no use, whatever you do.

431
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,492
Help me!

432
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,839
I will definitely save you.

433
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,556
There are six stages in an exorcism.

434
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,935
The goal of each stage is for the devil
to reveal his name.

435
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,439
and expels it from Eunseo's body.

436
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,776
You must follow my instructions carefully at every step.

437
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,363
Once an exorcism begins, it cannot be stopped.

438
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:59,246
If disturbed, Eunseo's life,
and all of our lives, will be in danger.

439
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:09,465
First stage: Presence.
We make the devil's presence real.

440
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,174
Brother...

441
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,303
I am very scared...

442
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,305
Get these people out...

443
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,891
I'm scared, sister...

444
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,311
Eunseo, it's okay.

445
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,604
Miss Jeongwon, don't answer.

446
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,445
Manager Kim, are you ready?

447
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:31,779
Ready.

448
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,283
Nona Jeongwon?

449
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,494
Nona Jeongwon.

450
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,373
No, if I call, you have to answer.

451
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:42,790
Hah?

452
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,376
Activate the equipment.

453
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:45,793
Good.

454
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,381
Vital signs within normal range.

455
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:52,967
Let's start.

456
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,099
From now on, answer my questions.
Otherwise, it will hurt.

457
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,230
Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

458
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,857
Say your name!

459

Talk!

460
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:17,950
What happened?

461
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,326
We are now entering the Pretend stage.

462
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,454
From now on, the devil will try to deceive us.

01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,172
This is why unexpected events keep happening.

530
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,216
This whole house is cursed.

531
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,095
Then what should we do?

532
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,889
We have to remove all these marks.

533
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:54,401
Labula Nasta Lahela. Na Ollakasda Lahela.

534
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,721
What happened to me?

535
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,184
It felt like something was coming out of my body.

536
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,603
Miss Eunseo, are you okay?

537
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,480
Are you starting to wake up a little?

538
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:32,898
Wait a minute.

539
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,026
Brother.

540
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:42,908
Let me go.

541
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,370
Eunseo, is that you? Do you remember your brother?

542
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:47,913
Wait a minute.

543
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,603
This damn woman is going to die anyway.

544
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,690
You remember, right?

545
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,612
You caused all those poor children to die.

546
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,824
The Voice Stage has begun.

547
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:34,417
Sir. Please help me, sir.

548
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,129
Please help me, sir.

549
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,556
Joseph who killed them?

550
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,267
No, you killed them.

551
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,521
Because you couldn't eat your Joseph,
all the children died.

552
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,150
Now, come with me to Him.

553
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,569
Then you can attain eternal life.

554
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,864
Otherwise, you will kill this child too.

555
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,450
Just like you killed your mother, Sister Angela.

556
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:20,505
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill!
- No! You can't! You can't! - Kill!

557
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,427
Kill!

558
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,025
This.

559
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,402
I'm fine.

560
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,031
Don't be fooled.

What is this?

569
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:39,894
Closing.

570
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,939
Why are you carrying a cover?

571
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,107
You told me to bring a cover.

572
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:49,070
I said bring thick clothes! Oh, shit. Thick clothes!

573

Say your name!

585
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,437
Then I will end this pain.

586
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,231
Quick, say your name.

Hey, move aside.

612

Ah, damn. This house is a complete mess.

Warehouse?

623

What's that?

624
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,478
Eunseo slowly turns into a demon.

of the devil on a mere human?
