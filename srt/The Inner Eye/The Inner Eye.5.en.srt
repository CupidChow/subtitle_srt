You're 21, right?

By the age of 21,

I'd started

Ten million yuan.

163
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,400
Ten million yuan?

164
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,560
Are you crazy?

165

So you don't want to

169

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,840
Please get out of here

171

178

and resulted in her ectopic pregnancy

179
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,280
and hemorrhage!

180
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,200
There's more than that.

181

I'll send it to you later.

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,040
will be famous.

188
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,840
Even if your wife

189
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
will forgive you,

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,360
how about your leader?

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Will you have any chance

192
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,800
to treat any patient here?

193
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,880
By the way,

194
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,200
does your wife know what you did?

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll give you two days.

196
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,760
If you don't give me any response

197
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,120
after two days,

198
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,240
I'll gently press

199
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,000
the send button,

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,840
and you, Doctor Qin,

201
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,400
will be famous.

202
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
Think it over.

203
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
Hypocrite!

204
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
Qin Ming, a surgical expert at Huamu Hospital,

205
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
cheated on his wife with a college student

206
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,120
and resulted in her ectopic pregnancy

207
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,920
and hemorrhage!

208
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,840
Is Xixi asleep?

209
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't speak my daughter's name!

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
You're disgusting!

211
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,240
He wants ten million yuan,

212
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,440
or he'll send the video out!

213
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,800
If it's posted online,

214
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
I'll be done!

215
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,200
Do you mean

216
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
they set you up

217
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,920
to cheat you to cheat on me?

218
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,240
It's her brother!

219
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,560
Manli would never...

220
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Manli?

221
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,280
Qin Ming,

222
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,320
you can betray our marriage,

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
but do you still remember

224
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
you have a daughter?

225
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,400
When you were

226
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
fooling around with that woman,

227
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,240
did you ever think

228
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,400
if your affair

229
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,280
was really leaked out,

230
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,360
verbal abuses from the society

231
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,960
will affect your daughter's whole life?

232
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,120
Look at me!

233
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,960
Say something!

234
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,040
I was wrong, dear.

235
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,680
It's my fault.

236
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
I did a bad thing to you.

237
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,920
It's my fault.

238
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,960
If you want a divorce,

239
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll leave everything to you.

240
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
The house and our daughter are yours.

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm sorry, my dear.

242
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,040
A divorce?

243
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
So that you can be

244
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,280
with your Manli legally?

245
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Fat chance!

246
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,800
I won't allow you to take anything

247
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
from my daughter that belongs to her.

248
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,760
Besides,

249
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,280
there's one more thing.

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,880
I didn't tell you

251
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,120
I performed the hysterectomy

252
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,200
on Liu Manli,

253
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
and I saw you

254
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,640
standing out of the operating theatre

255
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,840
at Baohai Hospital.

256
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,120
Qin Ming,

257
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,120
what a coward you are!

258
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,080
How could you

259
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
abandon a heavily bleeding woman

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,640
in the operating theatre

261
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
and run away?

262
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,280
You have no balls!

263
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,120
So...

264
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,720
you already knew it at that time.

265
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,200
Then you

266
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,400
used that woman

267
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,800
to insult your wife.

268
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Now,

269
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,520
you are using your stare

270
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
to insult my professional ethics

271
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,400
as a doctor.

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,920
However,

273
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
I consider it

274
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,080
a redemption for your

275
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
and the woman's fault

276
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,640
by saving

277
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,960
the woman's life.

278
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,400
Since we are still married,

279
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm kind of forced to pay him

280
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,920
ten million yuan with you.

281
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
But I won't allow anyone

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,960
to ruin my life

283
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,120
with Xixi.

284
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
As for this thing,

285
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,520
I'll face it with you.

286
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,020
[Caller ID: Liu Guizhong]

287
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,440
What should I do?

288
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,520
Send him a message.

289
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
Ask him the quantity of money,

290
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,480
and the way to transfer.

291
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,280
Before 24:00,

292
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,160
give me five hundred thousand yuan,

293
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,760
or I'll post the video online.

294
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
Let's bargain with him,

295
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,840
and transfer it to him.

296
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,880
I've already given him fifty thousand yuan.

297
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,200
You transferred the money

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,720
to the investment APP,

299
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,560
so he has an excuse to argue

300
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,400
that you voluntarily engaged in

301
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,360
the online investment project,

302
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
far away from extortion.

303
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,280
So,

304
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,040
I should transfer the money to him

305
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,880
under his threat,

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,080
and keep the transfer record.

307
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
In this way,

308
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,160
we can get

309
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,120
his proof of crime,

310
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,560
right?

311
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,240
I've consulted with my lawyer.

312
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,440
Do as I've told you.

313
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
Two Pork Cutlet Noodles, small portion.

314
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,560
Got it!

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Two Pork Cutlet Noodles!

316
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,600
A hundred thousand yuan is all I have.

317
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,640
It's all yours.

318
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,280
Can you delete the video now?

319
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
Thanks a lot, Doctor Qin.

320
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,240
It's not enough.

321
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,560
Find a way to get more money.

322
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,400
For your own reputation.

323
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
You have such a pretty girl.

324
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
Do you want her to know

325
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,480
her father is a bad guy?

326
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,280
Sir,

327
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
add two extra eggs!

328
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,680
Hello,

329
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
is Liu Guizhong here?

330
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
Are you looking for my brother?

331
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,960
Yes, we are the police.

332
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,120
We're here for an investigation.

333
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,560
Manli, Manli!

334
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,240
I've got you something

335
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,320
nutritious...

336
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
Are you Liu Guizhong?

337
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,080
Guizhong,

338
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,640
did you go to him?

339
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,320
We are the police.

340
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,600
Someone called us

341
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,840
that you're suspected of extortion.

342
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,720
You should go with us.

343
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,800
You have the right to choose your defender.

344
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,480
Let's go!

345
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,120
Guizhong,

346
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,680
Guizhong, what's going on?

347
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,720
I've told you

348
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,520
he's a bastard!

349
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,480
You cannot trust him!

350
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,680
He called the police after giving me money!

351
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,000
Guizhong!

352
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,960
Make a call!

353
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,880
Call your lawyer

354
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,040
to save me!

355
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,760
Hurry up! Manli!

356
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,400
Okay!

357
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
How's your recovery?

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,240
Doctor Chen in charge of you

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
is very experienced.

360
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
Where is Qin Ming?

361
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,360
Severe anemia.

362
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,280
It takes a long time to

363
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,480
rest and recover.

364
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,560
If you don't rest well,

365
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,160
you won't be healthy any more.

366
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,760
What a pale look!

367
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,200
You must

368
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
have not taken a good rest lately.

369
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
You should

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
cherish yourself.

371
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm asking you: where is Qin Ming?

372
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,000
He won't see you any more.

373
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Forget about him.

374
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,920
Could you please let me see him?

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,640
You...

376
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,359
I won't sue you

377
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,440
for removing my uterus.

378
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,760
Here's the thing:

379
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
from the time when I

380
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,359
held the scalpel,

381
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,520
I have never done anything

382
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,960
against my professional ethics.

383
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
You can pursue this matter and investigate it,

384
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,359
with all records kept.

385
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,079
You will know what on earth I did

386
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,320
during that surgery.

387
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,960
I saved your life,

388
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
whose owner

389
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,800
stole my husband.

390
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,400
Why did you save my life?

391
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,360
I would rather

392
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,600
you hadn't saved me.

393
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,840
You've lost your uterus

394
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
and harmed your brother.

395
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
Isn't it enough?

396
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,000
You! It's you!

397
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
You called the police!

398
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
He used your uterus

399
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,080
to blackmail us ten million yuan.

400
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,880
It's a crime of extortion.

401
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Shouldn't I call the police?

402
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,760
Please, don't!

403
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,080
You can come to me,

404
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,240
but not my brother.

405
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Set him free!

406
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm kneeling to you.

407
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,560
I'm begging you!

408
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,600
I give you my guarantee.

412
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,080
As for the money,

413
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,760
we... we will

414
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
pay you back!

415
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm begging you!

416
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,680

Please set him free!

418
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
I'm begging you!

419
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,160
When you were fooling around with my husband,

420
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,800
it was like a scalpel

421
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,400
cutting deeply

422
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
into my heart.

423
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,720
Now,

424
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm just

425
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
giving the scalpel

426
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
to you in the way you gave it to me.

427
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,040
Silly girl!

428
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,560
Each one of us

429
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,640
should pay off the debt

430
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,560
for what we owed.

431
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,480
My true love was trampled by him.

432
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,880
All I wanted to do

433
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,480
was to let him pay off the debt.

434
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,960
Attorney Tang,

435
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,240
I want to put it to an end.

436
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,960
Help me.

437
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,520
Okay?

438
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,800
Of course, she should

439
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
pay off the debt

440
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,680
for what she owed.

441
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,600
Stand up.

442
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,680
If Ms. Liu

443
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,320
was also cheated by Qin Ming,

444
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
the man who cheated her

445
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
should also pay off the debt.

446
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,720
You're not that silly.

447
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,200
With your attorney on site,

448
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,560
let me show you the bills

449

you should pay.

450
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,040
In the last two years,

451
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
my husband, Qin Ming,

452
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,520
has transferred money

453
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,360
to Ms. Liu Manli

454
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,920
with a total of 406,800 yuan,

455
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,080
and gave her some gifts.

456
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,480
These receipts are part of it.

457
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,200
Ma'am, please

458
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
tell Ms. Liu,

459
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,480
as his legitimate wife,

460
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,160

recover our common properties

462

Ms. Liu,

464
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,880
return the properties soon,

465
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,000
and I'll reconsider

466
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,600
if I'll waive my right to sue your brother

467
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,680
for his crime of extortion.

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,120

What should my brother do?

474

Help me! Save me!

475
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,240
Legally speaking,

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,760
as Qin Ming's wife,

477
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,280

to recover the money from you.

Attorney Dai, what's your opinion?

518
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,640
The value of the subject matter is not high.

519

If we have to take over the case,

520
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
we can hand it over

you don't need to ask others.

524
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,160

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,360
Attorney Tang,

527
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,560
there's nothing wrong

528
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,600
to choose the case

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,360
as you like,

530
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,520
but

531
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,480
you should

532
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
give us a reason.

right?

Director Kang asks me

537
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,840
to give you a reason.

538
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,600
To be honest,

539
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,960
I had none before,

540
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,320
but I have one now.

541
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
I take on the case because you disagree,

542
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,560
and that's my reason.

543
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,600

546
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,600
Since Attorney Tang chooses to

547
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
take on the case,

548

550
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
The principle of our law firm:

551
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,520
Choose independently,

552
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040

when a family member's signature was required

581
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,720
for the surgery.

582
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,840
It was deliberate.

583
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,920
He was scared to sign,

584
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,160
afraid it would create a paper trail.

585
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,640
But it's not clear

586
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,000
whether he knew at that time

587
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,600
that the doctor who performed the surgery

588
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
was his wife Bai Yaqing.

589
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,680
I've checked Bai Yaqing's

590
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,320
full surgery notes.

591
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,120
The rescue was timely and effective,

592
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,080
without any issues.

593
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,760
In fact, if she hadn't decided to

594
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,840
perform a hysterectomy

595
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,200
to stop the bleeding then,

596
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,920
Liu Manli probably

597
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,200
wouldn't have made it.

598
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
In a way,

599
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,800
Bai Yaqing

600
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,880
was her lifesaver.

601
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,720
But as for Qin Ming...

602
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,720
The doctor on duty said that

603
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,400
in cases of heavy bleeding

604
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,720
early in pregnancy,

605
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,400
the influence of external factors cannot be ruled out.

606
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
Apart from physical force,

607
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,440
medication is another possibility.

608
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
Medication?

609
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,680
How do I sue him?

610
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,040
First of all, your brother

611
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,160
is under suspicion for extortion.

612
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,680
You should brace yourself for that.

613
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
Separately, you can sue Qin Ming.

614
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,720
He was married when he was with you,

615
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,760
which led to your ectopic pregnancy.

616
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,640
Moreover,

617
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,920
when you sent for emergency care,

618
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
he deliberately did not answer his phone.

619
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,640
That made you

620
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,800
miss the golden hour for treatment,

621
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
and inflicted tremendous harm on you.

622
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,800
But legally, these are two separate cases.

623
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,920
No. He didn't do it on purpose.

624
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,120
It took only eighteen minutes

625
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,680
from the time he called

626
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,160
the ambulance

627
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,520
until it arrived at the housing estate..

628
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
But Qin Ming didn't provide

629
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,760
the exact address.

630
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
And during this period,

631
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,360
his phone

632
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
was out of reach

633
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,080
for a solid fifteen minutes.

634
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,440
That's why you missed the

635
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,840
golden hour for treatment,

636
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,800
resulting in

637
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,600
an unstoppable

638
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,760
hemorrhage.

639
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,040
During this process,

640
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,560
Qin Ming bears responsibility.

641
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,680
No. But he...

642
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,560
The situation must have been

643
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
too critical,

644
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,320
and he was too frantic

645
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,960
to think straight.

646
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,280
Qin Ming is a doctor.

647
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,400
Do you really think he didn't know

648
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
what to do?

649
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,640
Bai Yaqing

650
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,160
removed my uterus.

651
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,600
Did Qin Ming know about it?

652
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,680
Before your surgery,

653
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,560
the doctors asked Qin Ming

654
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,680
to sign the consent.

655
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,240
But for reasons unknown,

656
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,760
he left the hospital alone,

657
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,880
leaving you behind.

658
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Bai Yaqing is a

659
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,880
highly professional doctor.

660
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,560
There's a clear record of

661
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,080
every treatment she gave you.

662
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,000
She saved your life.

663
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,480
So,

664
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,920
based on the current evidence,

665
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,560
what cost you lost your uterus

666
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,960
wasn't the doctor who saved you,

667
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,240
but that missed golden hour

668
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,960
for treatment.

669
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,480
Do you see

670
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,640
what I mean?

671
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
I do believe you.

672
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,200
It's just...

673
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,240
I can't believe Qin Ming would...

674
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,120
You said before

675
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
that Qin Ming asked you

676
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,480
get an abortion.

677
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,360
But because

678
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,240
I was determined

679
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,680
to keep the baby,

680
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,320
he was so good to me

681
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,720
afterwards.

682
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,560
Back then,

683
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,640
I even thought...

684
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,280
I even thought he would marry me.

685
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,720
Do you remember what you ate

686
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,480
and did on the day

687
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,400
of the incident?

688
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,960
During that time,

689
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,760
he made time whenever

690
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,720
he could to come,

691
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,960
make sure I took my pills,

692
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
and simmer soup for me.

693
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,400
It was chicken soup that day.

694
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,160
I had two bowls.

695
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,440
I felt a bit unwell afterwards,

696
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
so he helped me

697
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,680
to bed.

698
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,760
He said it was

699
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,120
normal for early pregnancy

700
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,160
and that I'd be fine

701
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,680
after some rest.

702
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,720
So when did you

703
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,160
feel that something was wrong?

704
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,640
About one or two AM.

705
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
I began bleeding abruptly.

706
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
He told me it was

707
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,160
a sign of threatened abortion.

708
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,560
His first thought was to

709
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
drive me to the hospital.

710
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,280
but

711
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
I was in such

712
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,040
bad shape

713
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,600
that he called an ambulance.

714
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,840
Would you mind

715
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,160
if we had a look in your house?

716
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Careful.

717
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
This is

718
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,400
where Qin Ming and I live.

719
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,600
Maybe you should sit down

720
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,560
and rest for a while.

721
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,680
The doctor said that

722
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,640
you need a good rest.

723
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,160
Can we just look around?

724
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,200
What do you

725
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,160
want to find?

726
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,120
Some evidence,

727
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
related to Qin Ming.

728
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,320
He rented

729
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,960
this place to me.

730
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,160
Your medicine

731
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
and vitamins,

732
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,320
where did you usually keep them?

733
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,600
Right in this drawer.

734
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,880
Can I take a look?

735
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,920
No problem.

736
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,480
Everything in this house,

737
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,440
we decorated it

738
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,680
all together.

739
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Back then,

740
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,280
we wondered

741
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,000
what our dream home would be like.

742
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,320
This was his gift as well.

743
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,840
He said it could keep me company

744
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,280
in his absence.

745
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,200
Come on. Wake up!

746
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,080
The money Qin Ming spent on you

747
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,280
came from his and Bai Yaqing's

748
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
joint assets.

749
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,080
You'll have to return it all.

750
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,760
Were all these vitamins and supplements

751
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,160
from Qin Ming?

752
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,840
Yes,

753
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,800
all from him.

754
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,560
Said it was

755
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,200
good for the pregnancy.

756
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
He always had the vitamins ready

757
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
for me to take.

758
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,280
So, what specific types

759
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,840
were you taking?

760
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,720
Do you recall?

761
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,040
No. I'm not sure.

762
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,640
Miss Tang,

763
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,360
look at this.

764
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,040
I found it behind the trash can.

765
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,160
I've photographed it.

766
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,720
Take a look at this medication.

767
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,560
Is this what you usually take?

768
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,480
No, what I take daily are just

769
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,280
vitamins and calcium supplements.

770
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,400
I've never seen this before.

771
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,560
What is this?

772
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,920
What this is,

773
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,880
we don't know either.

774
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,400
Bag up all the vitamins

775
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,800
and supplements for lab testing.

776
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,480
Got it.

777
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,880
Attorney Tang,

778
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,320
Qin Ming wouldn't hurt me, would he?

779
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,600
The lab report

780
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,800
will show his intent.

781
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,680
You present yourself

782
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,200
as an

783
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,520
impenetrable shield,

784
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,800
always standing

785
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,000
in front of your husband.

786
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
Attorney Tang, you see yourself

787
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,880
as Liu Manli's lance,

788
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,680
and you can win this war for her?

789
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,960
You've got that wrong.

790
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,600
The role of a lawyer

791
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,680
is like a bridge.

792
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,280
My job is to get my client

793
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,080
safely across

794
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,440
this rough river.

795
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,800
The current's strong.

796
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,320
It won't be an easy crossing.

797
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,440
How much is she

798
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,720
even paying you?

799
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
I've looked into it.

800
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,560
You're a star attorney at Chen Jun Law Firm.

801
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,520
So why are you breaking your back

802
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,200
for a mistress's case?

803
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
What's in it for you?

804
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,880
I just want to help a woman

805
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,280
who lost her uterus

806
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
seek justice.

807
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,000
I deserve all of this.

808
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,640
She got what she deserved.

809
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
The price of this love

810
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,800
was far too high.

811
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,640
This is all my fault.

812
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,720
But my brother...

813
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,040
He was only trying to

814
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
protect me.

815
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,840
He just wanted to

816
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,160
get justice for me.

817
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,280
Justice?

818
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
How dare that homewrecker

819
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,680
talk to me about justice?

820
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,400
And you, a top-tier attorney.

821
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,440
How could you possibly take on a case

822
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,240
for a homewrecker?

823
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,320
She made mistakes, yes.

824
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,080
Her mistake was failing to see a scumbag

825
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,560
for who he really was.

826
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,720
Her mistake was being love-blind

827
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,280
and falling into a honey trap.

828
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,080
Her mistake was falling in love

829
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
with the wrong man.

830
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
That wasn't love.

831
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
It was an affair.

832
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,520
But

833
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,120
this does not entitle anyone

834
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,920
to inflict

835
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,400
deliberate harm upon her.

836
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,080
The law will equally protect

837
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,600
everyone

838
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,280
who has been illegally harmed,

839
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,200
regardless of who they are.

840
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Misoprostol.

841
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,320
A prescription abortion drug.

842
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,360
Found in Liu Manli's home.

843
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,480
I trust you

844
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,720
grasp the implication.

845
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,400
She would never

846
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,040
consent to taking this.

847
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,480
During that period, Qin Ming was always

848
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,520
at Liu Manli's home—

849
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,120
making soup for her and giving her pills.

850
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,840
It's highly likely that

851
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,760
he mixed this drug in

852
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
when giving Liu Manli

853
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,000
her vitamins.

854
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
If the police investigate

855
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,720
and confirm that

856
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
he obtained the drug illegally,

857
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,360
and then used it illegally to

858
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,400
terminate the pregnancy,

859
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,280
then the person truly responsible for

860
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,240
Liu Manli losing her uterus

861
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,040
is him.

862
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,320
Attorney Tang,

863
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,760
can you persuade Liu Manli to

864
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,760
accept a settlement before the lawsuit?

865
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,400
If money

866
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,120
can change all this,

867
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
I'm willing to settle with money.

868
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,080
As long as she agrees

869
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,760
not to pursue legal action against Qin Ming.

870
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,400
Compensation?

871
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,120
Do they think money

872
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,560
can solve everything?

873
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,080
How much money can

874
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,280
buy back the uterus I lost?

875
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,360
How much money can

876
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,840
buy back the dignity I lost?

877
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,400
Qin Ming has destroyed

878
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,960
not just Liu Manli's life,

879
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,679
but mine

880
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
and my daughter's as well.

881
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,000
Attorney Tang,

882
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
my daughter...

883
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
she cannot have a father

884
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,520
in prison.

885
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,360
She needs a father

886
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,719
who is

887
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,920
publicly respectable,

888
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,040
even if we divorce.

889
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,120
One million yuan.

890
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,920
The pregnancy termination procedure

891
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,080
caused severe physical harm

892
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,639
to my client.

893
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Her recovery and rehabilitation

894
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,920
will require funds.

895
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,239
Furthermore,

896
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,400
she plans to study abroad,

897
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,040
which means additional costs

898
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,080
for living and tuition.

899
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,159
Two million yuan.

900
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,080
Three million yuan.

901
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,560
If you agree to this amount,

902
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
I am willing to approach my client

903
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,320
to gauge her acceptance.

904
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,080
I never thought about

905
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,120
accepting compensation.

906
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,840
You were right, Attorney Tang.

907
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,160
I should return those assets.

908
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,040
That's a wise decision.

909
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,880
If you were me,

910
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,080
would you choose

911
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,080
to sue or to forgive?

912
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,240
We are different.

913
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,760
I don't let love blind me

914
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,440
and lose my reason.

915
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,120
Nor do I wallow in indecision

916
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,200
and make things worse.

917
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,160
Liu Manli,

918
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,600
you are already eighteen.

919
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,240
You are an adult now.

920
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,040
The road ahead

921
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,760
only gets harder.

922
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,400
You must pick up the shattered pieces

923
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,280
of your former self,

924
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,600
one by one,

925
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,960
and put yourself back together.

926
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,120
You have to stand up.

927
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,160
You have to face

928
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,480
your even harder future

929
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,160
with all your

930
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,880
strength and courage.

931
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,440
You're right.

932
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,200
Money can't undo

933
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
the harm you've suffered.

934
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
But this money

935
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,520
allows you,

936
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,680
for a period of time,

937
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,040
to focus on healing

938
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,760
and to live without financial worries.

939
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,440
You could also use it

940
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,120
to resume

941
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,280
your unfinished studies,

942
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,160
or use it

943
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,360
to travel further

944
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,760
and explore the world

945
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,880
on your own terms.

946
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,560
The choice is yours.

947
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,520
This is the best settlement

948
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,760
I can obtain for you

949
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
before we file a lawsuit.

950
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,080
If I grant criminal leniency,

951
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,800
does that mean

952
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,640
he'll get away with

953
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,840
what he did to me?

954
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,960
You can choose to

955
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
report it to the police

956
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,400
or file

957
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,680
an incidental civil lawsuit.

958
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,920
But the compensation amount

959
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,400
may likely be less favorable,

960
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,840
possibly under three million.

961
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,680
Can you accept that?

962
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,480
In the end,

963
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,440
it's your choice whether

964
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,200
we take this to court or not.

965
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,280
I checked with the university.

966
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,160
They've kept

967
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,120
your enrollment active.

968
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,800
The door is open

969
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
if you decide to

970
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,840
go back.

971
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,760
I'm afraid I won't

972
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,120
be able to come back.

973
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,440
Come on.

974
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,120
Me?

975
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,920
Give it a try.

976
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Manli,

977
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,280
keep your eyes on your goal,

978
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,720
and your mind focused

979
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,520
only on it.

980
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,280
Ignore all distractions.

981
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Once more try.

982
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,320
Good job.

983
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,920
Attorney Tang,

984
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,480
if...

985
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,720
if I insist on suing him,

986
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,280
can you help me

987
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,640
win this case?

988
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,840
I won't promise a win.

989
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
But I promise you this:

990
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,120
I'll give it my all to

991
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,920
get you the best possible outcome.

992
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,360
Good morning. Director Bai.

993
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,960
Have a seat.

994
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,280
Attorney Tang.

995
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm here to consult you

996
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
regarding my divorce agreement

997
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,840
and the division of assets.

998
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,120
May I ask,

999
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
why you chose our firm?

1000
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,960
The city has plenty of capable attorneys.

1001
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,400
But

1002
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,160
who truly respects

1003
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,600
a client's will

1004
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,200
and always

1005
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,600
seems to win,

1006
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,800
you're the only one I know.

1007
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,040
That's generous.

1008
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,640
Miss Tang.

1009
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,520
I want you to meet

1010
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,400
Attorney Lin Xiaoyun.

1011
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,280
She will be responsible for

1012
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,600
assisting you with drafting the divorce agreement

1013
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,160
and handling subsequent related work.

1014
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,400
If  you have any questions,

1015
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm also here to support you fully.

1016
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,720
Director Bai.

1017
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,400
You have

1018
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,280
my full support.

1019
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,000
I believe in you.

1020
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,240
I demand that Qin Ming

1021
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,560
get nothing.

1022
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,520
The court finds Qin Ming

1023
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,600
guilty of intentional injury

1024
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
for causing physical harm

1025
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,440
by administering drugs without consent.

1026
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,720
Given the victim Liu Manli's

1027
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,040
letter of leniency,

1028
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,600
Qin Ming was sentenced to

1029
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,280
five years of imprisonment

1030
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,800
and ordered to pay

1031
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,480
compensation of RMB 800,000.

1032
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,520
Liu Guizhong,

1033
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,240
convicted of extortion.

1034
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,480
With returned illicit funds

1035
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
and the victim's leniency,

1036
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,920
sentenced to two years.

1037
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,920
[Academy of Fine Arts
Works Exhibition of 2024 Graduation]

1038
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,000
Bai Yaqing

1039
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,320
has divorced Qin Ming,

1040
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,360
He left with nothing.

1041
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,240
No surprise.

1042
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,760
But it has nothing to

1043
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,920
do with me anymore.

1044
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
If I had never met him,

1045
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,320
my work would likely

1046
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
be here too.

1047
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,600
The price of my choice.

1048
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,760
It takes going through it

1049
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,720
to get it.

1050
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,720
I believe your future creations

1051
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,560
will carry even greater power.

1052
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,360
The truth is,

1053
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,680
you have

1054
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,920
many choices in life.

1055
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,040
Thank you.

1056
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,400
Attorney Tang.

1057
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,920
I never expected

1058
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,800
you could secure me

1059
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,360
an 800,000 yuan settlement.

1060
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
I have a question for you.

1061
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,200
If you could choose again,

1062
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,440
would you take

1063
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,920
the 800,000 yuan

1064
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,480
or choose to have never met Qin Ming

1065
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,640
at all?

1066
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,760
Never met him at all.

1067
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,520
See?

1068
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,960
You can make a choice now.

1069
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,880
That's real progress.

1070
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,520
Attorney Tang,

1071
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,600
I can't thank you enough.

1072
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,440
All these changes in me

1073
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,480
are because of you.

1074
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,280
You made me understand that

1075
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,240
a person needs courage,

1076
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,720
self-belief,

1077
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,680
and independence.

1078
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,920
I used to be

1079
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,520
so...

1080
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,960
so naive,

1081
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,120
so easily swayed,

1082
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,680
and so trusting.

1083
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,400
But rest assured,

1084
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,440
I won't

1085
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,680
be that foolish ever again.

1086
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
Back in university,

1087
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,840
my psychology professor

1088
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,720
once had us

1089
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,800
do a training exercise.

1090
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,320
When we covered our eyes

1091
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,400
and no longer used them

1092
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,920
to see the world,

1093
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,640
but instead observed it with our hearts

1094
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,760
and judged it with our minds,

1095
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,600
the world could be richer

1096
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,200
could be richer

1097
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,480
and more real than

1098
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,280
what our naked eyes saw.

1099
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,360
What's done is done.

1100
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,560
An ending is a new beginning.

1101
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,000
Congratulations.

1102
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,040
The nightmare is over.

1103
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,360
Attorney Tang,

1104
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,160
you have a delivery.

1105
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Could you pass me the scissors, please?

1106
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,800
Okay.

1107
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,200
It's very beautiful.

1108
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,520
When the compensation turned into plane tickets

1109
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,720
and brushes,

1110
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,120
the empathy I once saw

1111
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,240
as weakness

1112
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,040
proved to be

1113
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,680
the soil where justice grows.

1114
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,040
And in the soul of

1115
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,840
the blindfolded girl on the canvas,

1116
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,840
it flowered into a field of color.

1117
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Does this look straight, Miss Tang?

1118
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,680
Yes, it's good.

1119
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,080
It's truly unexpected

1120
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,720
that she managed to

1121
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,240
get this result

1122
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,600
from a case like this.

1123
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,480
Look at that painting.

1124
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,360
That woman

1125
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,640
with her eyes covered.

1126
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Doesn't she look like her?

1127
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,760
Though blindfolded,

1128
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,160
she appears utterly lucid

1129
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,400
and resolute.

1130
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,960
Yes, they look similar.

1131
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,440
Now I see why

1132
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,320
Chen and you value her so much.

1133
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
Against all opposition,

1134
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,320
she stood her ground.

1135
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,680
She delivers justice

1136
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,280
while securing

1137
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,480
a higher attorney's fee.

1138
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,360
That kind of ability...

1139
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,360
Well, junior,

1140
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,320
impressed?

1141
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,240
Absolutely. Completely convinced.

1142
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,360
Her skill

1143
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,120
and work ethic

1144
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,440
changed my view entirely.

1145
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,400
I'm sold.

1146
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,280
The scene in the painting

1147
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
did not grow from personal sentiment,

1148
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,680
but from legal clauses

1149
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,040
infused with blood and tears,

1150
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,920
from which its own veins then grew.
