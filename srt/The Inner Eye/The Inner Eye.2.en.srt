3
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,009
What's the point of suing them?

4
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,490
Do you know how hard it was to raise you?

5
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,890
You just went to a wedding,

6
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,490
but ended up in such a mess.

7
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,450
If you hadn't called the police,

8
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,250
would the situation be like this now?

9
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,850
You knew perfectly well

10
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,850
that the guy is a friend

11
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,970
of your cousin's husband.

12
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,810
They're

13
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,450
business partners.

14
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,490
Mrs Zhang,

15
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,170
have a seat

16
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,970
and calm down.

17
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,730
Ok, thanks, you're here.

18
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,770
Please calm down. Sit and talk it through.

19
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,210
Maybe

20
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,930
you could do as your uncle says.

21
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,210
Settle for some money and drop it.

22
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,050
Mrs Zhang,

23
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,090
sorry to interrupt, but

24
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,810
how about we discuss this later

25
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,130
when Miss Zhang feels better?

26
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,610
What do you say, Madam?

27
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,010
No more delays.

28
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,650
Now,

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,170
Mr Kang is here.

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,090
Mr Kang,

31
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,329
tell them

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,770
that we're calling off the case.

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,850
Settle for a fair amount,

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,650
and we can cease the case.

35
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,370
Procedurally speaking,

36
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,250
the victim

37
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,650
has no right

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,050
to end the lawsuit.

39
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,210
If the defendant

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,090
slanders

41
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,890
Miss Zhang's reputation,

42
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,370
we will charge them for

43
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,250
the infringement of right of reputation.

44
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,610
Sue them again?

45
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,329
You mean

46
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,690
one more lawsuit?

47
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,010
We should protect our legal rights.

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,930
Are you trying to make things worse?

49
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,530
Haven't you seen all the filth

50
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,810
they are saying about my daughter

51
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,570
online?

52
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,610
A car model with underwear,

53
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,770
being over-exposed...

54
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,970
She will move on

55
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,810
and get married someday.

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,370
Once they find out,

57
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,170
they'll look down on her.

58
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,090
What will they say against me?

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,090
What did I even do?

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,250
What's my crime?

61
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,570
Being a car model?

62
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,810
I didn't steal or rob anyone.

63
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,370
I stand for over a dozen hours every day.

64
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,930
I earn my money

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,530
through honest hard work.

66
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,329
I knows all that, dear.

67
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,370
But,

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,890
in the end,

69
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,010
girls suffer more in such trouble.

70
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,890
Things have gotten out of hand,

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,850
I don't want to

72
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,810
drag it out with them any longer.

73
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,690
Miss Tang, thank you.

74
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,690
What you suggested

75
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,090
worked.

76
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,850
At least, the public opinion

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,970
shifted now.

78
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,970
There's one more thing I'd like to clarify.

79
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,570
If we can prove that

80
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,650
Zhang Yi

81
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,690
seduced Shi Li,

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,329
then

83
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,570
my son will be innocent of

84
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,610
indecent assault.

85
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,090
Ms. Ren,

86
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,610
I never advised you

87
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,170
to smear the victim

88
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,850
in order to manipulate public opinion.

89
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,370
And regardless of the victim's occupation,

90
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,490
it has nothing to do

91
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,530
with this case.

92
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,130
Whether they

93
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,250
were sober or drunk

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,850
before entering the room,

95
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:17,769
and regardless of

96
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,130
how close

97
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,610
their relationship was

98
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,850
then,

99
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,730
once Miss Zhang said no,

100
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,170
Shi Li must

101
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,610
respect her wishes.

102
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,650
Things shouldn't have

103
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,210
gone this far.

104
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,410
But now the other side

105
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,890
won't accept a settlement.

106
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,690
They insist that Shi Li

107
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,130
must be punished by law.

108
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,090
Mr Kang,

109
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,570
what should I do now?

110
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,890
Should we still sue them?

111
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,170
In public prosecution cases, even if

112
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,370
the accused obtains the victim's forgiveness,

113
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,890
generally speaking,

114
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,010
the case can't be withdrawn.

115
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,690
Since they refuse to settle,

116
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,290
we have no choice

117
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,970
but to see it through in court.

118
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,010
However,

119
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,530
I must make it clear to the public,

120
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,570
whether it's Aina Group,

121
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Shi Li or me,

122
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,890
we won't let anyone

123
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,770
unscrupulously

124
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,930
smear our names.

125
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,890
I am the victim

126
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,850
but why

127
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,490
is everyone blaming me

128
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,410
as if

129
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,850
I'm the guilty one?

130
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,650
It's not your fault.

131
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,330
You are not to blame for this.

132
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,330
The tea spilled on the Internet,

133
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,010
actually,

134
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,530
I didn't smear her;

135
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,370
all these things

136
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,010
were what she actually did.

137
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,690
I just presented the facts

138
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,730
to the public in a different way.

139
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,970
Isn't that right?

140
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,050
You must be aware

141
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,970
that any remark on the Internet

142
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,050
can be exaggerated.

143
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,210
Do you realize

144
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,170
what you did

145
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,050
will hurt Miss Zhang?

146
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,490
Have you even thought about it?

147
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,930
Look at me now,

148
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,490
this is what I deserve.

149
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,570
If I just

150
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,130
disappeared in this world,

151
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,210
all these would be over.

152
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,930
I should have died in the car crash.

153
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,690
I'd rather stay dead.

154
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,770
Hasn't Shi Li

155
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,090
also been hurt?

156
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,890
How can you expect me to believe

157
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,930
that my son is

158
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,450
a sexual offender

159
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,530
who forces women?

160
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,690
What makes you so certain

161
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,530
that your son is innocent?

162
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,330
I understand your feeling,

163
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,250
and I've been through similar things once.

164
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,170
Do I have no choice but to

165
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,610
keep putting up with these?

166
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,090
All adults

167
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,050
have to take responsibility for

168
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,970
what they've done.

169
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,370
Ms. Ren,

170
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,130
do you know what your son is really like?

171
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,770
Miss Tang,

172
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,730
I've dedicated my life

173
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,530
to my career.

174
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,610
In a way,

175
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,730
I am not a

176
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,930
qualified mother.

177
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,330
To be honest,

178
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,970
if you were a mom,

179
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,210
I am afraid

180
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,330
you couldn't understand me.

181
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,409
You know,

182
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,490
when he was a little baby

183
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,330
if he cried,

184
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,650
I felt it noisy.

185
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,770
Even when he got sick,

186
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,770
I thought

187
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,490
it too much hassle.

188
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
So from an early age,

189
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,690
he knew exactly

190
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,250
that he must try his best

191
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,210
to do everything,

192
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,370
just to

193
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,410
prove himself

194
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,850
and win my credit.

195
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,410
Well, when it went viral

196
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,650
on the Internet,

197
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,490
to

198
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,290
protect Aina's brand image

199
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,250
I even considered

200
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,330
renouncing our parent-child relationship

201
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,090
to the public.

202
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,370
But now,

203
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,570
I trust him.

204
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,810
My son

205
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,330
would never do anything so foolish.

206
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,170
Well, I can share

207
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,450
a case I know with you.

208
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,130
A PhD from a top foreign university,

209
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,610
who was a brilliant student,

210
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,730
but ended up raping and killing

211
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,810
three female students at campus.

212
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,050
What's his motive?

213
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,970
He did this just to seek excitement.

214
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,090
Certainly, here I'm not talking about Shi Li.

215
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,090
What I mean is

216
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,890
that we can't

217
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,810
conjecture one's behaviors

218
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,730
based on their past.

219
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,290
Zhang Yi was once a car model,

220
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,330
but it couldn't prove

221
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,890
that she is a girl of loose morals.

222
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,250
Shi Li might be outstanding in the past,

223
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,250
but it doesn't prove

224
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,210
that he is definitely innocent

225
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,610
in this case.

226
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,490
Are you trying to tell me

227
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,010
pleading innocence

228
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,010
is hopeless?

229
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,930
All I can say is,

230
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,530
until we find new evidence,

231
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,530
I can't make any promise.

232
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,930
Miss Tang,

233
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,610
I always trust you.

234
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,610
[Chen Jun Law Firm]

235
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,210
How's Auntie?

236
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,970
Is she okay?

237
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,010
She's fine.

238
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,290
It's just on a happy wedding day,

239
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,250
something like this happened.

240
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,730
Some relatives

241
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,810
came to stick their noses in.

242
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,050
You know how it is like.

243
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,730
And you?

244
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,050
I'm all right.

245
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,690
It's just my wife's family

246
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,170
is in a bit chaotic, though.

247
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,450
Yaya's livestreaming business

248
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,810
is taking a big hit.

249
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,850
Her parents are money‑focused.

250
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,490
Come in here.

251
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,170
Today's meeting has been

252
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,410
filed with the police.

253
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,730
So now in this room,

254
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,330
I am

255
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,730
the suspect's defense attorney.

256
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,090
You are a witness, understand?

257
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,250
Shi Li said

258
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,850
that he and Zhang Yi knew each other earlier.

259
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,090
Did you introduce them?

260
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,130
Yes.

261
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,370
Did you introduce them

262
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,890
to each other

263
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,970
as a potential couple?

264
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,290
My wife's always said

265
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,010
to keep an eye out

266
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,330
for a good match for her cousin.

267
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,170
Shi Li and I

268
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,410
met in university.

269
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,970
he was a top student before going abroad.

270
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,530
He had tons of admirers

271
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,570
at campus then.

272
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,810
Plus,

273
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,010
we are familiar

274
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,170
with his appearance and background.

275
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,930
So I did suggest Zhang Yi

276
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,770
to consider Shi Li.

277
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,010
From what you know about Shi Li,

278
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,530
as you can see,

279
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,810
how does he feel about Zhang Yi?

280
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,970
Zhang Yi is Shi Li's type.

281
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,010
But I can't imagine

282
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,570
that Shi Li would do something like this.

283
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,810
From his university days

284
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,130
all the way through his studies abroad,

285
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,010
there was never short of admirers.

286
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,570
But he cared more about his studies

287
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,250
and becoming Aina's successor.

288
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,530
He's pretty disciplined,

289
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,530
focusing on his career,

290
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,650
and never paying much mind

291
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,730
to girls.

292
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:27,930
He was

293
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,130
as for me,

294
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,170
being drunk

295
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,170
and a momentary loss of control.

296
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,890
About Zhang Yi being a car model,

297
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,450
did your wife leaked that?

298
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,130
Why would she do that?

299
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,610
She didn't expect

300
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,090
things to turn out like this.

301
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,410
Suddenly, her livestream got flooded

302
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,290
with nasty comments,

303
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,450
saying the bride

304
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,090
got bridesmaids to entertain guests on purpose.

305
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,930
So awful remarks!

306
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,250
Sales on her livestreaming plummeted.

307
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,530
Being panicked,

308
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,050
she came up with this way

309
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,170
to save her reputation.

310
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,930
So she only cares about her own image,

311
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,090
and doesn't care who may get hurt.

312
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,050
I tried to talk to her,

313
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,010
but her work

314
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,930
means a lot to her.

315
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,090
She even thought

316
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,890
that Zhang Yi went after Shi Li

317
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,770
and was rejected by him.

318
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,730
So she turned her back on him

319
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,010
and revenged.

320
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,570
Could you give me

321
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,530
a guest list

322
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,570
and seating chart on the wedding?

323
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,370
But for what?

324
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,690
We need

325
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,250
more testimony from guests.

326
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,330
That might not be appropriate.

327
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,130
I mean,

328
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,570
we were already embarrassed

329
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,090
and there is no need to bother others.

330
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,330
To avoid

331
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,690
future trouble for your family,

332
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,090
I think it's necessary.

333
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,810
Fine.

334
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,890
According to the statements from Zhang Yi

335
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,210
and others present by the police,

336
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,890
the incident room

337
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,930
was originally for the bridal party

338
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,250
to do makeup and change clothes.

339
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,490
At 8:36 PM,

340
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,130
Zhang Yi returned from a restroom outside.

341
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,770
Being drunk,

342
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,090
Shi Li helped her into the room.

343
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,930
Around 8:57 PM,

344
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,450
other members of the bridal party

345
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,410
arrived at the outer area of the suite,

346
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,450
and heard

347
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,410
Zhang Yi's cries for help from inside.

348
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,850
Is there any security footage?

349
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,850
Yes, the footage shows

350
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,210
outside the room

351
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,170
lingered they around one minute,

352
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,330
likely a small conversation.

353
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,570
But there's no audio.

354
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,090
This room is where the bridal party

355
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,970
get their makeup on.

356
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,290
The room ahead is the crime scene.

357
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,450
Well, I expect to see you again

358
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,650
in the court.

359
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,850
I came to have a look at the scene.

360
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,970
May I introduce,

361
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,890
he is a well‑known lawyer, Mr Kang,

362
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,530
also Zhang Yi's attorney.

363
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,410
Nice to meet you, Mr Kang.

364
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,810
I'm Miss Tang's assistant,

365
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,690
Lin Xiaoyun.

366
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,570
Hello.

367
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,850
Since you are here as women,

368
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,090
at the crime scene,

369
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,210
do you feel

370
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,290
some sense of empathy

371
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,410
for what the victim went through?

372
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,170
Then as a lawyer,

373
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,970
Mr Kang here,

374
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,210
are you trying

375
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,730
to figure out the truth

376
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,650
that day?

377
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,410
I will fetch a glass of water.

378
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,490
Shi Li!

379
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,290
Shi Li!

380
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:13,930
Bitch!

381
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,650
Shi Li!

382
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,930
Shi Li! Stay away from me!

383
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,450
Get off me!

384
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,690
Let me go!

385
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,250
Shi Li!

386
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,330
Zhang Yi,

387
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,690
I am sorry!

388
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,970
I just lost my mind.

389
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,010
I am so sorry.

390
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,170
Get out.

391
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,450
A pair of groomsman and bridesmaid

392
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,090
were standing at the door then.

393
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,330
They heard the sound

394
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,810
from the room

395
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,090
and saw Zhang Yi

396
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,570
running out through that doorway.

397
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,610
When Zhang Yi and Shi Li

398
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,330
entered the room,

399
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,210
she didn't object.

400
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,130
Zhang Yi was drunk at that time.

401
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,010
How could she possibly object him?

402
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,410
To what extent?

403
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,650
Unconscious?

404
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,530
Now what are you implying?

405
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,370
An adult woman,

406
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,010
if she was completely

407
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,490
uncooperative,

408
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,890
it is hard to drag her in

409
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,610
even for a grown male.

410
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,250
Besides Zhang Yi's cries,

411
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,970
did the people outside

412
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,330
hear anything else?

413
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,410
No.

414
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,610
Zhang Yi also said

415
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,530
that she drank too much,

416
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,290
and couldn't remember

417
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,170
what Shi Li said to her.

418
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,610
Shi Li's statement was the same.

419
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,290
that he just saw Zhang Yi was drunk,

420
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,570
and helped her into the room.

421
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,010
Sorry to interrupt,

422
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,730
Miss Tang,

423
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,690
What exactly are you trying to prove

424
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,130
by coming here?

425
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,330
Don't you think it's strange, Mr Kang?

426
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,010
When they entered the room

427
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,210
to the time when she cried for help,

428
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,850
twenty minutes passed.

429
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,690
If Shi Li really wanted

430
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,330
to force Zhang Yi to have sex,

431
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,570
and if Zhang Yi really wanted to resist him,

432
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,690
she could cry for help at any time.

433
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,890
Why did she wait so long?

434
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,290
It is because

435
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,210
she was drunk at that time.

436
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,210
Even if she tried to resist,

437
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,330
how could a woman's strength

438
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,170
compare to a man's?

439
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,970
Especially

440
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,770
when that man

441
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,410
lost all control.

442
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,210
Do I make myself clear?

443
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:13,970
Mr Kang,

444
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,650
do you really understand women?

445
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,290
Most people think

446
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,250
women can't match men

447
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,090
in strength.

448
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,090
But data tells a different story.

449
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,570
Some women who

450
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:24,970
fight back

451
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,810
with all their might,

452
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,850
can

453
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,490
hold their own against some men.

454
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,850
Your data

455
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,330
doesn't apply to everyone.

456
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,290
That's exactly why I said "some women."

457
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,930
What makes you voice for that "some"?

458
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,130
Come on, we can have a try.

459
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,330
What?

460
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,930
You are a man

461
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,050
who is taller and stronger than me.

462
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,850
Let's see if I could defend myself

463
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,050
when you pretend to assault me.

464
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,770
Come on!

465
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,410
Sorry,

466
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,010
but we see things in different ways.

467
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,130
I don't think we'll agree on this.

468
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,010
Mr Kang,

469
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,770
it looks like you don't get women at all.

470
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,930
Miss Tang, your phone.

471
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,290
Miss Tang,

472
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,970
you say that I don't understand women,

473
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,730
what about you?

474
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,010
You know Zhang Yi is the victim,

475
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,330
yet you try your best

476
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,650
to get the perpetrator off.

477
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,810
You won't stop

478
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,770
until Zhang Yi seeks to suicide,

479
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,210
will you?

480
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,450
Mr Kang,

481
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,770
if you think I'm wrong,

482
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,770
then go ahead and complain me.

483
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,890
If you truly care about Zhang Yi,

484
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,050
do your very best to help her.

485
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,570
We both

486
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,490
defend our own side.

487
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,370
I don't need you

488
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,050
to lecture me like a senior.

489
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,610
You're so emotionally tied to your client

490
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,450
that I really wonder how you've managed

491
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,610
to be a lawyer all these years.

492
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,610
Zhang Yi was in a car accident

493
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,650
driven by online bullying,

494
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,330
being suspended from work.

495
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,690
She was almost

496
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,850
on the edge of collapse.

497
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,530
Was it an accident or a suicide attempt?

498
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,050
No one knows.

499
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,330
I don't know what tricks you may play,

500
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,850
and I don't care.

501
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,050
I just want to remind you,

502
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,410
if Zhang Yi suffers any more hurt

503
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,090
because of this case,

504
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,690
wouldn't you

505
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,810
feel guilty?

506
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,130
"if you think I'm wrong,

507
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,050
then go ahead and complain me.

508
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,730
If you truly care about Zhang Yi,

509
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,010
do your very best to help her."

510
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,170
"But given your character,

511
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,890
I suppose

512
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,530
you wouldn't just go after money.

513
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,570
Mr Kang, you overestimate me."

514
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,570
[Sent]

515
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,330
Since we're out to relax,

516
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,210
let's not dwell on

517
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,170
stress and anxiety.

518
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,250
Should I pretend all of these

519
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,170
has nothing to do with me?

520
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,650
This isn't the first time and it won't be the last

521
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,330
that things like this happened.

522
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,970
As lawyers,

523
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,730
we should be mentally prepared.

524
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,250
If you were me,

525
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,930
what would you do?

526
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,410
You should stand firm

527
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,530
and stick to the choice in your heart.

528
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,930
Listen to your inner voice.

529
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,450
Close your eyes

530
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,250
so you won't be swayed by appearance,

531
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,970
nor be led by power or influence.

532
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,170
Let no personal ties bend you,

533
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,490
no lie deceive you,

534
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,210
nothing from the outside world

535
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,530
cloud your thoughts.

536
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,810
Only then can you

537
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,370
tell what justice is.

538
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,810
You mean

539
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,170
that in this case

540
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,530
I am over subjective?

541
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,090
You should

542
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,890
treat this case with your heart,

543
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,050
not with your eyes.

544
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,050
Think about

545
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,770
the most important part you missed.

546
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,050
Who is it?

547
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,770
Zhang Yi.

548
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,970
But I argue for the suspect.

549
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,570
Didn't you say that nothing

550
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,290
matters more than winning the case?

551
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,290
The point isn't your identity,

552
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,050
but to get the job done.

553
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,330
You should know

554
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,730
what to do now.

555
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,290
Let's grab a drink.

556
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,330
Sure.

557
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,610
Honey!

558
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,450
Mr Qi really sticks to you.

559
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,450
You already taken over

560
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,970
half of our alone time.

561
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,410
Guess I'm out tonight.

562
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,130
He asked me out

563
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,730
earlier in the morning

564
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,810
for dinner tonight.

565
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,450
I have a gift for you.

566
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,330
A gift for me?

567
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,290
We ordered it in Hong Kong for you.

568
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,570
Thank you,

569
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,010
for the sake of the gift,

570
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,650
Go

571
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,890
and enjoy your date.

572
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,690
Bye.
Bye.

573
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,050
Mrs Qi,

574
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,250
your husband

575
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,690
has been starving all day waiting for you.

576
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,730
You poor thing!

577
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,530
Yeah.

578
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,130
Our daughters

579
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,890
will stay over at my parents' tonight.

580
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,410
So tonight it's just you and me.

581
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,530
Thank you.

582
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,170
I have a small gift for you.

583
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,330
Nothing fancy

584
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,650
but I made it myself.

585
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,330
Hope you don't mind, dear.

586
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,170
So pretty!

587
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,650
You told me

588
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,650
that when you were a kid,

589
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,850
you love to fall asleep while touching the

590
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,530
butterfly embroidery on your grandma's Qipao.

591
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,890
I have found the photos

592
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,530
and recreated the patterns

593
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,130
from her dress

594
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,490
by hand.

595
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,850
The craft was tricky

596
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,890
and it took me months to learn the skills.

597
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,850
Did it hurt?

598
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,570
It's okay.

599
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:54,890
I think

600
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,610
your love counts more than anything.

601
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,650
Thanks.

602
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,370
Honey,

603
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,810
it's been a while since you've had a break.

604
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,490
What if we go somewhere

605
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,010
for another honeymoon?

606
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,050
I've already talked to my mom.

607
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,810
The girls will stay with her.

608
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,810
Just the two of us.

609
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,690
Sounds good.

610
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,570
But I don't want

611
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,970
a third child.

612
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,410
Let's just see how things go.

613
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,810
Kids are

614
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,370
gifts from God, aren't they?

615
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,770
I'm sure

616
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,930
that I only want our two daughters.

617
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,850
That's enough.

618
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,570
But you know

619
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,250
the older generations

620
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,970
always hope for a boy.

621
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,090
We already

622
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,610
made this clear last time.

623
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,130
Yes, I understand.

624
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,210
You really suffered

625
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,450
when we had our second daughter.

626
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,810
And you've sacrificed a lot lately.

627
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,050
But I won't let having babies

628
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,250
affect your work.

629
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,130
I'll take good care of you.

630
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,530
Honey,

631
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,730
let's try one more time, ok?

632
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,610
Here, your favorite.

633
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,850
I queued up just for this.

634
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,570
Boss,

635
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,290
you just come back from Beijing

636
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,090
and rushed to see me.

637
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,130
Is it because of

638
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,730
that case I just took on?

639
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,570
Pei Lin asked you to take the case, right?

640
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,770
Well, about the case

641
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,810
I know more

642
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,530
about the details than anyone else.

643
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,250
Besides,

644
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,690
Ms. Ren is generous.

645
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,570
I know how you work

646
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,370
and your attitude.

647
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,290
But right now, this case

648
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,170
is exposed to the public spotlight.

649
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,490
Mess this up,

650
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,930
you'll be at the centre

651
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,650
of the storm.

652
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,890
I'm getting older.

653
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,530
I can't weather any more storms.

654
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,370
Boss,

655
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,450
you wasn't so cautious in the past.

656
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,770
I understand what you're worried about.

657
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,410
But this time,

658
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,370
I won't take your advice.

659
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,170
I know what I'm doing,

660
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:23,650
and I am aware

661
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,130
where I'm walking into.

662
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,970
From the day I pursued the career,

663
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,930
you have taught me

664
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,370
that a lawyer has to do

665
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,490
what a lawyer should.

666
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,250
Law will give a fair verdict.

667
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,570
What's more,

668
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,890
I'm already part

669
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,210
of this case.

670
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,170
I can't just walk away

671
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,090
and pretend that it's none of my business.

672
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,530
Alright.

673
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,450
But keep in mind:

674
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,770
watch your words and actions.

675
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,690
Got it.

676
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,570
Haven't I always been that way?

677
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,050
Now eat up.

678
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,450
Which hospital?

679
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,450
What happened to my daughter?

680
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,650
Please calm down.

681
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,170
It's a mild concussion.

682
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,650
She's fine and already came home.

683
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,610
Have a seat.

684
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,050
Stay calm. Take a seat.

685
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,290
Here.

686
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,930
Such serious thing happened to my daughter,

687
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,450
but I didn't even know.

688
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,530
You're the one to tell me, a lawyer.

689
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,610
As her legal counsel,

690
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,330
I don't know Zhang Yi well.

691
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,730
But right now,

692
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,890
considering her condition

693
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,890
and state of mind,

694
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,570
she needs help.

695
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,250
As her father,

696
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:29,890
could you

697
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,370
do something for her?

698
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,210
That's why I'm here.

699
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,810
Yes, yes.

700
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,850
I… I should do something.

701
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,130
What can I do?

702
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,650
I have to find a solution for her.

703
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,810
I... In what way?

704
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,410
I...

705
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,170
Got it.

706
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,410
Lawsuit.

707
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:51,970
Work.

708
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,250
Public opinions.

709
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,730
And relatives.

710
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,650
Go to court.

711
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,290
Sue them.

712
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,890
Fight back to the end.

713
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,410
Jobs can found later.

714
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,890
After the lawsuit,

715
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,330
she can go back to school and explain it.

716
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,890
Oh,

717
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,370
and the public pressure.

718
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,810
I told them before

719
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,690
to stay away from the relatives,

720
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,250
who are all opportunistic

721
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,810
and fence sitters.

722
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,930
It's their fault.

723
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,930
[Caller ID: Attorney Tang]

724
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,730
We must fight against them to the end.

725
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,410
Ok.

726
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,650
If I were you,

727
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,330
I wouldn't come here

728
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,930
to meet the victim at this time.

729
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,410
This meeting

730
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,890
is permitted by the court.

731
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,810
And I'm here

732
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,970
with the victim's consent.

733
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,250
It's legal and compliant.

734
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,250
Any problem?

735
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,850
Are you persistent

736
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,290
or just stopping at nothing?

737
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,010
Watch your words.

738
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,850
It's called professionalism.

739
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,250
You're pretty professional, too.

740
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,570
Actually, to resolve

741
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,530
this dispute properly,

742
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,090
you and I,

743
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,450
are the same.

744
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,890
Noted.

745
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,290
Was her car accident serious?

746
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,130
Are you feeling guilty

747
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,050
because you stirred up public opinion

748
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,490
and smeared her?

749
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,730
I'm warning you again,

750
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,930
please watch your words.

751
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,810
Slander is illegal.

752
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,850
Physical injuries aren't severe,

753
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,170
but which caused

754
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,810
mental problems

755
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,010
are very serious.

756
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,810
I've also contacted her father,

757
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,930
hoping to

758
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,370
help her out soon.

759
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,930
Her father is a professor,

760
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,850
since his divorce,

761
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,890
has barely seen his daughter.

762
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,250
You know pretty well about her background.

763
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,850
So professional.

764
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,730
How could Xiao Yi be like this?

765
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,330
So thoughtless.

766
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,010
Is it our fault?

767
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,250
We didn't mean it that way.

768
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,370
Then why she acts like this?

769
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,410
We came all the way to see her,

770
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,570
but just look at

771
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,930
her attitude!

772
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,650
She is feeling bad recently,

773
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,170
so just don't push her.

774
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,850
What do you mean by saying that?

775
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,250
Am I pushing her?

776
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,130
All trouble

777
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,530
comes from your side.

778
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,890
My daughter and son-in-law

779
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,250
haven't had a peaceful day

780
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,210
since the wedding.

781
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,370
You're just

782
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,210
hiding out here for rest,

783
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,330
while the rest of us

784
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,370
suffer and struggle?

785
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,370
She once

786
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,210
pursued Shi Li,

787
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,770
but now she won't own up to it.

788
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,330
Uncle, aunt.

789
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,730
I am the victim

790
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,650
and I am your family.

791
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,730
But you scold me for this.

792
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:33,810
Get out.

793
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,090
Xiao Yi,

794
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,410
we're doing this for your own good.

795
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,290
We only want what's best for you.

796
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,010
Xiao Yi.

797
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,730
Coming!

798
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,050
Hi, Mr Kang.

799
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,930
Hello.

800
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,810
Please come in.

801
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,570
Here.

802
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,930
Xiao Yi, Mr Kang is here.

803
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,610
Allow me to introduce,

804
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,530
this is Shi Li's defense attorney,

805
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,850
Tang Yingying.

806
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,570
Zhang Yi, you agreed to meet her.

807
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,610
Is she hired by Shi Li's family?

808
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,770
Yes.

809
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,450
Hello,

810
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,330
I'm Xiao Yi's uncle.

811
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,690
I met Shi Li once

812
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,850
at the wedding.

813
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,650
He hurt Xiao Yi

814
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,210
so deeply.

815
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,610
He owes her an apology.

816
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,730
An apology is due.

817
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,650
And we'll offer you

818
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,210
a certain amount of compensation.

819
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,290
Compensation?

820
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:28,890
Well…

821
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,050
How much will you offer?

822
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,890
Miss Tang,

823
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,370
come and talk in my room.

824
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,770
But...

825
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,570
Thanks.

826
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,250
You're welcome.

827
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,210
I know you don't want to see me.

828
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,770
After all, in this case,

829
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,690
I'm representing the other side.

830
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,930
But as lawyers,

831
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,010
we both hope

832
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,050
this case can be

833
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,170
properly resolved.

834
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,930
You're the victim.

835
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,290
So within the limits of the law,

836
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,130
you deserve

837
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,050
some financial compensation.

838
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,010
Of course,

839
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,770
I am here today

840
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,370
isn't just

841
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,570
to discuss compensation.

842
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,650
On behalf of Shi Li,

843
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,490
I will show you our apology and sincerity.

844
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,250
Whatever terms you propose,

845
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,410
we're open to converse.

846
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,170
Obtaining the victim’s forgiveness

847
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,010
doesn't mean that Shi Li

848
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,250
can walk free.

849
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,850
He will still face criminal charges.

850
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,130
The sentencing

851
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,490
will be determined fairly by the law.

852
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,850
As for the settlement offered by Miss Tang,

853
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,450
it's up to you to accept it or not.

854
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,730
Didn't they say online

855
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,010
that I was after money in this incident?

856
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:51,930
I don't want any compensation.

857
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,890
And no more reconciliation.

858
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,090
I want him behind bars.

859
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,770
The longer the sentence, the better.

860
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,170
Zhang Yi,

861
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,050
don't you really remember me?

862
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,050
That day at the wedding,

863
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,250
we met at the hotel.

864
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,410
Your bridesmaid dress

865
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,370
was amazing.

866
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,210
"Nice shot!

867
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,170
It's pretty."

868
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,410
Miss Tang,

869
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,850
please don't use misleading words

870
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,370
to disturb my client, okay?

871
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,730
Well, I'm afraid this isn't misleading.

872
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,770
Whether you met or not,

873
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,770
does it even matter?

874
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,730
Is it important?

875
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,210
What are you trying to prove?

876
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,610
Zhang Yi,

877
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,010
I know you've suffered a lot.

878
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,490
After the incident,

879
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,650
you chose to stand up

880
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,010
for your rights through the law.

881
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,490
I think that's truly courageous.

882
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,290
Really, as a woman myself,

883
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,890
I deeply respect and support

884
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,970
your bravery.

885
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,130
But as an advocate for the suspect,

886
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,490
his legal rights also need to be protected.

887
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,890
Mr Kang is right.

888
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,290
Lawbreakers

889
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,250
must be punished by the law.

890
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,770
But the verdict

891
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,690
must be based

892
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,370
on truth and facts.

893
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,610
Where exactly did we meet?

894
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,850
In the hotel restroom.

895
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:39,970
I was there that day, too.

896
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,690
"Go ahead.

897
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,010
Then we will go find Yaya."

898
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,570
Miss Tang, I think today...

899
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,210
I know, Zhang Yi.

900
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,449
I know in this incident

901
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,570
that you are under enormous pressure.

902
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,250
So

903
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,969
I hope you can be braver.

904
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,409
Tell us that night

905
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,090
what really happened

906
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,449
in that room.

907
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:28,969
I think...

908
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,489
we should end the conversation here today.

909
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,850
My client needs time

910
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,130
to consider your proposal

911
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,290
and make a decision. Okay?

912
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:34,530
Here.

913
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,610
I'm not asking her to decide right now.

914
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,330
I'm just asking her to tell the truth.

915
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,770
I warn you again.

916
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,690
Don't forget

917
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,210
that you are a lawyer.

918
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,530
You keep emphasizing

919
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,210
truth,

920
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,130
so what is the truth?

921
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,489
Is it the fact?

922
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,929
Or is it the answer you seek?

923
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,530
Hey, calm down.

924
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,730
Lao Zhang, put it down.

925
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,610
Let's talk through this calmly.

926
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,170
We're family.

927
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,690
You're a university professor,

928
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,130
is this really necessary?

929
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,010
Shut up!

930
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,810
You keep saying

931
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,130
it's for Yier's own good.

932
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,290
You all make good points.

933
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,690
You've all suffered a lot.

934
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,290
But your points and your grievances

935
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,170
are just knives

936
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,810
hurting my daughter!

937
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,410
Let me tell you,

938
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,490
don't you dare to bully my daughter,

939
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,130
I'll use this to fight you to the death.

940
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,210
No, no, put it down.

941
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,130
Lao Zhang, don't lose your mind.

942
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,450
We're all family.
Dad.

943
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,010
Sweetheart, uh...

944
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,690
You, go back to your room.

945
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,730
No matter what you hear,

946
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,810
stay in your room.

947
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,650
Mr Kang, call the police.

948
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,730
Lao Zhang's gone crazy!

949
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,370
He's going to throw acid on us!

950
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,850
What? Sulfuric acid...
Sulfuric acid is nothing.

951
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,330
Still remember high school chemistry?

952
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,330
Concentrated hydrochloric and nitric acids

953
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,810
are mixed in proportion,

954
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,890
and here comes this,

955
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,490
it can dissolve you all.

956
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,490
Dad.

957
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,770
Don't blame the wrong person.

958
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,290
Stay silent.

959
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:52,650
Now hold your tongue.

960
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,370
The man who assaulted Xiao Yi

961
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,610
is that rich guy Shi Li.

962
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,530
Right, she...

963
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,610
She's the lawyer they hired.

964
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,290
Throw it on her.

965
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,610
It has nothing to do with us.

966
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,410
Wait a moment, professor Zhang.

967
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,410
Are you  the lawyer of that bastard?

968
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,650
Calm down, professor Zhang.

969
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,730
Listen to me,

970
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,170
Carrying dangerous chemicals

971
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,770
and threatening others is a serious crime.

972
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,290
You'll face severe punishment,

973
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,610
a criminal liability, don't you understand?

974
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,210
Cut the act!

975
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,810
I wasn't talking to you.

976
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,850
I'm asking her.

977
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,330
You...

978
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,130
Yes, I am Shi Li's

979
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,010
defense attorney.

980
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,170
I come here today

981
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,090
to solve problems.

982
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,530
If you have any concern,

983
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,610
we can sit down and talk through it.

984
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,650
I won't talk to you.

985
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,930
No more talks.

986
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,850
Let me make it clear,

987
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,050
we will sue him.

988
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,370
That bastard must

989
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,890
be punished by the law.

990
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,210
No problem.

991
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,730
If the law can't work,

992
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,170
I'll wipe him off the face of the earth.

993
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:35,450
Ok.

994
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,850
To kill anyone you want

995
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,730
is your personal decision,

996
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,690
Just keep us out of it.

997
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,690
But have you ever considered...

998
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,210
Enough.

999
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,530
If your daughter is found to

1000
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,210
deliberately conceal the truth and deceive,

1001
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,970
do you realize what she will...

1002
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,170
Shut up!

1003
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,650
Take off your coat.

1004
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,130
Take it off.

1005
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:10,610
Leave me alone.

1006
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,490
But get the coat off first.

1007
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,330
Leave me alone.

1008
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,490
Where is water?

1009
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:14,810
Water...

1010
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,810
There's water in the bathroom!

1011
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,890
What are you doing?

1012
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,810
Are you aware of

1013
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,050
your behaviors?

1014
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,850
Can you hear me now?

1015
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,810
Hold on, don't call an ambulance.

1016
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,690
It's not any acid, just a bottle of water.

1017
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,850
Lao Zhang, Seriously?

1018
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,890
Oh, you...

1019
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,250
Today's incident

1020
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,250
was an accident.

1021
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,010
I'm sorry.

1022
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,130
I apologize

1023
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,410
on their behalf.

1024
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,810
So this time

1025
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,570
could you not hold them responsible?

1026
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,610
Don't bother.

1027
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,010
It's fine, keep it on.

1028
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,090
Here.

1029
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,130
No need to do this.

1030
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,010
I know you've been through a lot

1031
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,410
because of this.

1032
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,890
But Lao Zhang was just acting

1033
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,170
in the heat of the moment.

1034
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,210
What?

1035
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,690
There is an wound on your face.

1036
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,450
Stay still.

1037
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,570
You're welcome.

1038
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,770
Actually, what I did

1039
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,610
was to protect you.

1040
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,490
So you are supposed to

1041
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,290
say thank you to me.

1042
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,010
We're even.

1043
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,250
Even. Good.

1044
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,810
So does that mean this matter

1045
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,130
is over now?

1046
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,850
Hello?

1047
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,770
Yes, I want to call the police.

1048
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,570
Keep an eye on him.

1049
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,210
As for Zhang Mengde's statement,

1050
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,610
is similar to what you've said.

1051
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,650
He explained that it was because of

1052
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,850
what happened to his daughter

1053
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,730
and he was too angry to let it go.

1054
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,970
He only meant to scare

1055
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,890
those two relatives,

1056
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,410
not to hurt either of you.

1057
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,290
Zhang Mengde

1058
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,850
has shown his remorse,

1059
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,850
and hopes to obtain

1060
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,930
Miss Tang's forgiveness.

1061
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,330
He is willing to take full responsibility.

1062
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,810
I accept his remorse and apology.

1063
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:43,970
I have no intention

1064
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,050
of pursuing his liability.

1065
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,810
Thank you for your efforts.

1066
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,330
Thank you so much.

1067
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,170
You never intended to hold him accountable

1068
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,250
from the start.

1069
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,730
Then why bother to call the police?

1070
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,130
It was my right

1071
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,170
as a threatened victim.

1072
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,410
Forgiving him is my choice

1073
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,850
as an act of grace. Does that conflict?

1074
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,570
So you're

1075
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,650
principled, huh?

1076
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,490
No, no...

1077
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,330
I'm not just principled,

1078
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,570
I'm professional, too.

1079
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,450
Miss Tang.

1080
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,130
What?

1081
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,890
I wanted to ask you something personal.

1082
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,650
If someone crosses you,

1083
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,050
what kind of person are you?

1084
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,890
I'm the vindictive kind.

1085
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,090
If someone pisses me off,

1086
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,490
then I will pay them an eye for an eye

1087
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,530
and get rid of them.

1088
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,770
Get rid of them.

1089
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,530
Say.

1090
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,530
Boss, I found a key piece of evidence

1091
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,210
for this case.

1092
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,730
Following the list Cao Sheng offered,

1093
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,250
I located some videos

1094
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,410
from the wedding.

1095
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,290
They do contain

1096
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,450
what we are looking for,

1097
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,730
but I didn't think it was enough.

1098
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,090
Until this afternoon,

1099
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,450
when I found this.

1100
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,610
Here.

1101
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,490
"It's said that this wedding planner

1102
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,330
is a top choice for new couples."

1103
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,130
Louder.

1104
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,370
"Let's take a selfie."

1105
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,410
"Shi Li, am I your girlfriend?"

1106
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,610
"Am I your girlfriend?"

1107
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,930
How did you found

1108
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,850
this video?

1109
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,890
After I asked all guests on the list,

1110
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,730
I was wondering if there is other chances.

1111
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,170
After all, the hotel is huge.

1112
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,250
Apart from the wedding,

1113
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,610
there must've been many people then.

1114
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,610
Maybe we could find

1115
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,850
videos shot by other visitors.

1116
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,610
You've been working hard lately.

1117
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,810
Well done.

1118
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,330
I'm not as sharp as you.

1119
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,130
With this case,

1120
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,530
I couldn't contribute too much.

1121
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,370
Compared to you, I just

1122
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,610
dedicate more time to it.

1123
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,370
Sometimes the slower way pays back.

1124
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,410
Smart or slow,

1125
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,490
as long as it helps,

1126
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,530
it's a good way.

1127
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,410
Play it again.

1128
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:08,930
Ok.

1129
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,170
"It's said that this wedding planner

1130
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,770
is a top choice for new couples."

1131
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,930
"Shi Li."

1132
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,370
"Let's take a selfie."

1133
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,050
"Am I your girlfriend?"

1134
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,810
"Am I your girlfriend?"
