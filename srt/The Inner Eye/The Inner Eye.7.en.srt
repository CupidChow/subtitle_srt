3
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I want to see Mr. Hu.

4
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,320
Mr. Hu is discussing

5
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,880
some important company matters.

6
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,720
Please wait.

7
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,920
Zhang,

8
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,079
Mr. Hu wants you to go in alone.

9
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,200
Okay, Lan.

10
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,320
Thanks for coming.

11
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,240
You even made a special trip to Guangzhou.

12
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,960
For you, it's no trouble at all.

13
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
How is Mr. Hu doing?

14
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
It has spread everywhere.

15
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
He has only days left.

16
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
But for now,

17
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
he's still fairly clear-headed.

18
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,560
He's been settling

19
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
the things that need to be settled.

20
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
Nicole told me before boarding the plane.

21
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
She should arrive very soon.

22
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
Hu probably has something

23
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
set aside for his daughter.

24
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,040
With you here,

25
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
I feel reassured.

26
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
What about you?

27
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,520
As his ex-wife,

28
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,480
he's treated me reasonably well.

29
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
I suppose he's shown some decency.

30
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,960
Sis,

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
The will Hu made months ago

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,840
states that

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,600
all his company shares

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,160
will go to the son he has with Meiyuan.

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,399
I know the company is important to you.

36
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
I just spent hours in there

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
talking with him

38
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,240
about our early startup days.

39
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
Honestly, I was exhausted.

40
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
Let's go home first

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
and talk later.

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay.

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
You really have no shame.

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,360
What right do you have to be here?

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
What right do you have to visit my dad?

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,480
Nicole.

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
Well, congratulations to you.

48
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,159
Your wish is finally coming true.

49
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,880
All those petty schemes of yours.

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,640
None of them went to waste.

51
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
This is a hospital.

52
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,560
Your father is still inside.

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
Let's all save some dignity.

54
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,960
I used to have both parents.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
I had a complete family.

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Ever since you showed up,

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
our family fell apart.

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
You were just a private dance instructor,

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,320
using me to seduce my father,

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
hurting my mother.

61
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,960
And you dare talk to me about dignity?

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
Looks like your mother

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,040
hasn't taught you much these years.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Say that again.

65
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,280
Who do you think you are

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
to comment on our family business?

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
My dad ending up like this

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
is all because of you.

69
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,520
Aunt Tang.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,120
Nicole, you just landed.

71
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
You haven't seen your dad yet.

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,440
Sorry about that.

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Nicole is still young.

74
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,840
She lost control just now.

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,240
Attorney Tang,

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,000
nice to meet you again.

77
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Everyone, please calm down.

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Hu's condition

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,680
doesn't allow him to talk much right now.

80
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,440
Please head back for today.

81
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,560
You can visit again tomorrow.

82
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,400
Doctor, I've been on a plane

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,640
for over ten hours.

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,880
Can I just see him for a moment?

85
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,400
Nicole.

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,080
Follow the doctor's instructions.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Your mom is waiting for you.

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,560
Mom.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
How exactly is my dad?

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,520
If it weren't absolutely necessary,

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
if it weren't urgent,

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,920
I wouldn't

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,640
ask you to fly back.

94
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,360
He said he'd spend Christmas this year

95
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,000
with me in the UK.

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
These past few days,

97
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,680
your father keeps talking about you.

98
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,280
Nicole, just remember this.

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,600
Your dad has always loved you.

100
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
That's all that matters.

101
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,040
Auntie,

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,120
is my dad really leaving

103
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,800
the whole company

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,080
to that woman's son?

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,000
Mr. Hu has his own arrangements.

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
But don't worry.

107
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,640
You're his daughter.

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,880
He won't abandon you.

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Your job, your life.

110
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,320
He's planned for all of it.

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,000
My mom can handle that too.

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
She can support me.

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm just unwilling to accept this.

114
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,360
Unwilling to

115
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,400
let Zheng Meiyuan cheat her way into so much.

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,320
Auntie,

117
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,560
you came to Guangzhou

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,440
to help us, right?

119
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,600
I'll stay with you

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,640
these next few days.

121
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,480
Does Mr. Hu know about this?

122
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,320
This new paternity test

123
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,080
has only been seen

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,320
by you and me.

125
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,920
But back when Mr. Hu made his will,

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,320
when he planned to leave

127
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
his shares to his son,

128
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,120
he had a paternity test done.

129
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,480
That one

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,799
was forged by Zheng Meiyuan.

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,400
So that means

132
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,280
Meiyuan's son

133
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,960
has no legal right to inherit anything.

134
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Then you should give this

135
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
to Mr. Hu.

136
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,320
One moment of anger

137
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
opens a thousand doors to disaster.

138
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,920
Hu is about to pass.

139
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,280
Shouldn't we let him

140
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,120
leave with dignity,

141
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
without regrets?

142
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
You're right.

143
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,400
Zheng Meiyuan and her child

144
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,160
have no right

145
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,320
to those shares.

146
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
I want you to take

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,760
this new paternity test

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
and talk to her properly.

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
Get her to give up

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,160
what never belonged to her.

151
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,360
Sis,

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,320
do you hate Meiyuan?

153
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
What goes around comes around.

154
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,880
All of this

155
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,560
is her own doing.

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm just protecting Hu

157
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,040
and his company

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,800
from leaving in the wrong hands.

159
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
Do you think I can persuade her?

160
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
Of course.

161
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,480
You're my attorney.

162
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I trust you completely.

163
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,040
Attorney Kang, I hear the female lawyers

164
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,320
at Chen Jun Law Firm

165
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,960
are quite famous.

166
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,120
Beautiful and highly capable,

167
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,880
just not easygoing.

168
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,400
Roses may be beautiful,

169
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,080
but you have to accept the thorns.

170
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,960
Thorny roses

171
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
tend to hurt hands.

172
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,280
Director Chen left you

173
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,240
quite a mess to handle.

174
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,240
And this is?

175
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,960
Our firm's rose.

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
Feeling better now?

177
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm fine after some rest.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm okay now.

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,760
You rested all day today?

180
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,200
Didn't I tell you?

181
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
I felt better after resting,

182
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
so I got back to work.

183
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,840
You should've at least

184
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,360
checked in with me.

185
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,920
Didn't you say this morning

186
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn't need to tell you?

187
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,520
I went out today

188
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,840
to handle something important.

189
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,840
On this business trip with me,

190
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,040
was there someone more important?

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
Mr. Hu from Lanhu Group.

192
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
You know him.

193
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,760
His ex-wife, Lan.

194
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
We grew up together.

195
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,520
She's like a real sister to me.

196
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,600
Mr. Hu

197

is dying now.

198
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,200
The will and inheritance

199
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,560
are extremely complicated.

200
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
She needs me right now.

201
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,120
So you came to Guangzhou

202
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,680
just to deal with private matters?

203
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,000
Private matters are still work.

204
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,200
She's my client,

205
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
and the firm's client.

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
Fine. Be specific then.

207
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,440
Why is it complicated?

208
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
That's private then.

209
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,560
I always thought

210
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,960
after our last talk

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,520
we were already allies.

212
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,120
Maybe we are even...

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120

Thanks.

216
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,040
Thank you.

217
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
I'm tired.

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,120
Director Kang, enjoy your drink.

219
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Did I upset you?

220
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,920
It's not about you. I'm just tired.

come meet the client with me.

I'll sort things out

and send you the details later.

226

Did you forget

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,640
to apologize to me?

[Paternity Test: Hu Cheng & Hu Yaozu]

230
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
What do you want?

231
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,800
My client hopes

232
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,280
you'll voluntarily give up

233
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,280
Hu Yaozu's inheritance of the shares.

234
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
As compensation,

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,680
you may state

236
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,000
your financial demands.

237
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,120
Why should I?

238
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,240
How did you get

239
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,800
this so-called paternity test?

240
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
I can only tell you

241
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,680
the result of the test

242
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,640
is real.

243
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,640
And I believe you know that too.

244
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,400
So,

245
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,600
this was all your doing.

246
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Ms. Zheng,

247
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,320
what exactly do you mean by that?

248
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,080
Attorney Tang,

249
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,880
back when Hu divorced his ex-wife,

250
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,200
you helped her take

251
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,560
half of Hu's shares

252
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,880
and multiple properties.

253
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,320
Looks like you planned this

254
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
from the very beginning.

255
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,360
You went to great lengths

256
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,920
to get this forged paternity test,

257
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,960
just to frame me

258
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,400
and force me out.

259
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
So this is how

260
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
you lawyers play.

261
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,080
Ms. Zheng, I hope

262
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,600
you can watch your words.

263
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,800
Baseless accusations like this

264
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,880
could be defamatory.

265
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,600
You know

266
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
whether it's defamation.

267
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
So you're certain Hu Yaozu

268
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
is Mr. Hu's biological son?

269
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,360
Of course.

270
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,000
I had a paternity test done before.

271
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
That's why Hu made a will,

272
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
leaving the shares to his son.

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Then I think

274
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,000
I need to remind you that

275
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,040
a paternity report

276
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,760
carries legal force.

277
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,280
Likewise,

278
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,600
forging one

279
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,040
is a crime.

280
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,000
What are you implying?

281
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
Are you saying

282
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,400
my report is fake?

283
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,440
That's not what I said.

284
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,080
But I will find the truth.

285
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Ms. Zheng,

286
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
I hope you understand this clearly.

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
If it turns out Hu Yaozu

288
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
is not Mr. Hu's son,

289
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
it won't just affect you and the child.

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,920
It will affect Mr. Hu,

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
and Lanhu Group as well.

292
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,600
The damage would be irreversible.

293
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,120
I believe no one wants

294
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,400
that outcome to happen.

295
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
Then go ahead.

296
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Tell Lan

297
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't accept her report.

298
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,480
Don't dress it up as

299
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
being for the company or Hu.

300
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
In the end,

301
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,200
she's just been scheming

302
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,440
for Hu's property.

303
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
And you are her accomplices.

304
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,920
Helping her plot

305
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,440
to push my son and me into a dead end.

306
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,080
Ms. Zheng, please calm down.

307
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,640
Calm down.

308
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,560
We're only here

309
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
to convey

310
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
our client's wishes.

311
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
That's fine. Think it over.

312
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,520
We can talk anytime, okay?

313
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,480
We'll take our leave.

314
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Let's go.

315
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,640
Goodbye.

316
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,360
Do you think all of this

317
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,040
was planned by Lan?

318
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,160
Today I only heard

319
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,880
Meiyuan's side of the story.

320
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,360
I don't really know Lan.

321
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,000
But you do.

322
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
She's your friend.

323
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,320
There's one thing I'm curious about.

324
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,480
Meiyuan already did

325
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,280
a paternity test.

326
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,960
Why did Lan

327
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,400
insist on doing a second one?

328
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Why was she so sure

329
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,360
the child wasn't Mr. Hu's?

330
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,760
I feel the same way.

331
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
It's like

332
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,760
she knew all along.

333
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,080
That's why I think

334
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
the report she holds

335
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,560
must be genuine.

336
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,680
But you saw Meiyuan today.

337
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,319
She was very certain.

338
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,880
It's possible

339
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,800
her report is real too.

340
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,680
Could it be that

341
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,359
when Meiyuan submitted the test,

342
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
she switched

343
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,200
the DNA sample?

344
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,040
So the DNA

345
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,200
wasn't Mr. Hu's at all?

346
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,160
That's possible. But the same

347
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,359
could be true for Lan.

348
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,599
No.

349
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,319
She wouldn't take that kind of risk

350
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,240
at a time like this

351
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,920
to forge a paternity test.

352
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,480
Unless

353
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,640
she had foreseen

354
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,720
another possibility.

355
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,760
What is it?

356
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,680
If Meiyuan is telling the truth,

357
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,560
Lan used this new report

358
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,400
while Mr. Hu was dying

359
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,040
to force Meiyuan

360
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
to give up the shares.

361
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
Or,

362
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,840
she wanted to

363
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,200
buy the shares cheap,

364
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,920
add them to what she already holds,

365
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,280
and become

366
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
Lanhu Group's largest shareholder.

367
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,080
So,

368
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,280
should I remind you

369
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,880
that Lan's our client?

370
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
Are you thinking this to hurt her?

371
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,400
Rather than taking sides,

372
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,520
I want the truth.

373
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
The truth.

374
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,640
The truth is,

375
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,360
we can almost be certain now

376
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,480
that Lan knew from the start

377
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,440
the child wasn't Mr. Hu's.

378
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
And she likely knows

379
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,000
who the real father is.

380
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
That's the truth, as I see it.

381
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,360
You playing or not?

382
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,960
Hurry up.

383
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
Eight Wan. Eight Wan.

384
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,360
Sis-in-law.

385
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Let's go. Go. Go.

386
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,760
Meiyuan, why are you here?

387
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,560
Yan Bin.

388
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,320
After all this mess,

389
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
you've lost weight.

390
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,920
Unlock it.

391
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,840
Unlock it.

392
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,920
Give it to me.

393
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,520
Meiyuan.

394
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
[Lan.]

395
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,120
Lan's attorney came today.

396
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,320
I know everything now.

397
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,760
It's not like that.

398
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,400
Speak.

399
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
How much did she pay you

400
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,600
to seduce me?

401
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,600
All that time,

402
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,320
even your sperm.

403
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,920
Meiyuan, listen to me.

404
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,080
It was all Ms. Lan.

405
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,120
Ms. Lan told me to do it.

406
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,440
I lost money.

407
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
I owed loan sharks.

408
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,560
I had...

409
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,880
I had no way out.

410
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,240
Ms. Lan said,

411
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,000
if I listened to her,

412
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,920
she'd fix everything.

413
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,080
And pay me 800000 yuan after.

414
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,560
800000 yuan.

415
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
I didn't want this, Meiyuan.

416
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,800
I really loved you, Meiyuan.

417
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,360
I used to hate

418
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
melodramatic TV dramas.

419
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,720
Never thought

420
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,600
the man beside me every day

421
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,000
would be

422
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,680
the lead in one.

423
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,640
Meiyuan.

424
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,800
Listen carefully.

425
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,520
That child is not yours.

426
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,280
He's Hu's son.

427
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
Meiyuan already did

428
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,000
a paternity test.

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,840
Why did Lan

430
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,280
insist on doing a second one?

431
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Why was she so sure

432
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,120
the child wasn't Mr. Hu's?

433
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,920
If Meiyuan is telling the truth,

434
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,800
Lan used this new report

435
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,640
while Mr. Hu was dying

436
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,280
to force Meiyuan

437
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,720
to give up the shares.

438
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,880
Or,

439
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,880
she wanted to

440
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,360
buy the shares cheap,

441
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,280
add them to what she already holds,

442
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,320
and become

443
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,600
Lanhu Group's largest shareholder.

444
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,120
So,

445
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,840
So,

446
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,000
Lan knew from the start

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,920
the child wasn't Mr. Hu's.

448
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,880
And she likely knows

449
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
who the real father is.

450
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,320
All of this

451
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,640
is her own doing.

452
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,960
Do you think I can persuade her?

453
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,960
You're my attorney.

454
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,960
I trust you completely.

455
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,960
[Attorney Tang.]

456
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,600
[Tomorrow at ten.]

457
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,040
[Yunqizhuang, private room.]

458
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
[Let's talk again.]

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
It was all Ms. Lan.

460
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,880
Ms. Lan told me to do it.

461
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,280
I lost money.

462
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,600
I owed loan sharks.

463
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,400
I had...

464
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,680
I had no way out.

465
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,960
Ms. Lan said,

466
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,480
if I listened to her,

467
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,880
she'd fix everything.

468
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
And pay me 800000 yuan after.

469
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,200
800000 yuan.

470
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
I was emotional yesterday.

471
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,440
Anyone would be.

472
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
In my position.

473
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,880
I just don't understand.

474
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,560
I loved Hu sincerely.

475
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,960
I only wanted a child

476
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,120
with the man I loved.

477
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,000
Why I met

478
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,480
with such malice?

479
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Yan Bin's words

480
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,560
are not conclusive evidence.

481
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,160
Whether the facts

482
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,840
match the recording,

483
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,600
I will verify

484
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,760
with my client.

485
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,480
So you're saying

486
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,120
you knew nothing

487
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,120
about what she did?

488
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,040
Then let me ask you.

489
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
After representing her

490
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,960
for years,

491
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,120
do you really know her?

492
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,680
Ms. Zheng,

493
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,400
even if

494
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
this recording is real,

495
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
it also proves

496
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,880
your infidelity during marriage

497
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
with Yan Bin.

498
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
That hurts your case.

499
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,600
I admit the affair.

500
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,520
But I won't accept

501
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,080
that the child is Yan Bin's.

502
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,720
I'll say it again.

503
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
Hu Yaozu

504
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,680
is Hu's son.

505
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm not using the recording

506
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,760
to prove anything.

507
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
But you know better than I do.

508
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,760
If Yan Bin told the truth,

509
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,840
shouldn't Lan

510
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,120
also pay a price

511
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,200
for what she did?

512
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,080
Setting traps, scheming for profit,

513
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,080
isn't that a crime too?

514
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,400
Yesterday you conveyed

515
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
Lan's demands.

516
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,800
I assume nothing has changed.

517
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,720
So today,

518
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,360
here is my answer.

519
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
I reject her terms.

520
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,400
Hu's will states clearly

521
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,960
all company shares

522
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,920
go to Yaozu.

523
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,080
Until he comes of age,

524
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,400
I hold them on his behalf.

525
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
This is what we deserve.

526
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,080
If she wants them,

527
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
I set the price.

528
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,840
Although Mr. Hu made a will,

529
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,760
it has not taken effect yet.

530
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Which means all assets

531
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
listed in the will

532
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,680
are still legally Mr. Hu's property.

533
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,680
So he still has the right to decide

534
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,760
the final ownership of these assets.

535
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,680
If you don't approve of

536
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Lan's paternity test,

537
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,640
you can ask the relevant authorities to verify.

538
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,080
If you still don't accept it,

539
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,760
we can also

540
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,720
do another paternity test

541
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
in front of witnesses from both sides.

542
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,400
But...

543
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,960
If we wait

544
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,560
until the results of the third paternity test come out.

545
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,480
Maybe by then,

546
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
we'll have to see you in court.

547
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,080
There's nothing left to discuss.

548
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,400
The recording provided by Meiyuan,

549
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,800
although it was edited,

550
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,080
it doesn't sound like a lie.

551
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,960
I know you're struggling right now.

552
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,880
As a lawyer,

553
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
you have to be in Lan's shoes.

554
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,520
But as a woman,

555
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
you're sympathetic to

556
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
what happened to that child.

557
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Woman! Woman!

558
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,600
Do you think you

559
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
know women well, Director Kang?

560
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,440
What I'm thinking

561
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,800
doesn't need you to tell me.

562
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,080
If you really want to help me,

563
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,040
then help me figure out

564
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,080
how to convince Meiyuan

565
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,480
to give up her inheritance rights.

566
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,440
What you need to convince now

567
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
is not Meiyuan,

568
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,960
but yourself.

569
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,680
What do you mean?

570
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
You're Lan's attorney

571
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,080
and also her best friend.

572
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,840
Furthermore, you know

573
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,480
that from the very beginning,

574
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,720
Lan had planned everything

575
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,960
to scheme against Meiyuan.

576
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,640
Then why do you still

577
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,560
insist on the conditions

578
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,240
she put forward?

579
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,160
Unless...

580
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,520
You think I'm involved in this,

581
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,440
and I'm involved in the scheme against Meiyuan,

582
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,160
right?

583
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,640
Stop the car!

584
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,720
I know that

585
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,280
you have always felt

586
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,560
that I am an unscrupulous person,

587
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
but I have never advertised

588
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,520
myself as a good person.

589
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,440
You can question my character,

590
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,120
but please don't

591
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,600
question my professionalism and principles.

592
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,600
I wouldn't stoop to

593
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,560
such despicable acts.

594
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Bad temper.

595
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
Sister.

596
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,600
There you are.

597
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,160
How's Mr. Hu doing?

598
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,280
These days, his periods of lucidity

599
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
are getting shorter and shorter.

600
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,880
Nicole is inside keeping her dad company.

601
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,320
After all, they are biological father and daughter.

602
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,600
Blood ties cannot be severed.

603
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,120
About Meiyuan and her child...

604
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,040
Let's have a chat.

605
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,760
Did she refuse my terms?

606
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,240
Sister.

607
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
How many other things

608
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
are you hiding from me?

609
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,760
When Hu and I founded Lanhu Group,

610
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
many people were jealous

611
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,800
and opposed us

612
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,400
openly and covertly.

613
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,200
Once the capital chain broke,

614
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,160
and something went wrong.

615
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,280
We owe a lot of money to the contractor.

616
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,520
Those people threatened

617
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,120
cut Hu's Achilles tendons.

618
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040
I went from door to door

619
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,200
begging people to lend me money.

620
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,160
Your mother took me

621
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,320
to ask your grandfather

622
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,400
for help in resolving the difficulties.

623
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,040
Yingying, your family's kindness

624
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,520
I will never forget.

625
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,760
Later, the company got back on track,

626
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
but Nicole fell ill.

627
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,360
Then Hu

628
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,360
let me go home and take care of Nicole.

629
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,400
He was in charge of the company alone.

630
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,600
Those brothers and sisters of Hu

631
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,680
are good-for-nothings,

632
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
yet they're all scrambling

633
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,800
to get a job at the company.

634
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,560
Hu is soft-hearted,

635
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,520
so he gave all of them shares.

636
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
But all the shady deals

637
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,240
they do behind my back

638
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
can't be hidden from me.

639
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,120
And later,

640
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
another person appeared.

641
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,480
Zheng Meiyuan.

642
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,400
Of course,

643
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,640
she is not the first person.

644
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,800
This company

645
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,200
holds half a lifetime

646
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
of my dedication and hard work.

647
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
Let me hand over to those people.

648
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
How could I be willing?

649
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,600
Meiyuan is not

650
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,400
as simple as we thought.

651
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,920
She has Yan Bin's recording,

652
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,000
which is very bad for you.

653
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
And she doesn't admit

654
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,920
that she forged the paternity test.

655
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,400
Sister,

656
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
for public purposes, I'm your lawyer.

657
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,560
You don't have to tell me anything that

658
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,680
has nothing to do with this case

659
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,120
or something that is unfavorable to you.

660
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,360
You can even get another lawyer

661
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
that you really believe in.

662
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,840
But in private,

663
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,680
all these years past,

664
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I've always regarded you as

665
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,080
the closest person to me.

666
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,440
As a sister,

667
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,480
I hope you can tell me the truth,

668
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
then I can know how to help you.

669
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,760
If she doesn't accept that terms of negotiation,

670
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,880
we will do another paternity test

671
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
While Lao Hu is still alive.

672
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,200
Hello?

673
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,080
Meiyuan called the police and said the child was lost.

674
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,840
Yesterday

675
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,880
we went to their house,

676
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
so the police asked us

677
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,760
to cooperate with the investigation.

678
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,760
Are you okay? What's wrong with you?

679
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,560
Do you believe me?

680
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,640
I never doubted you.

681
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,280
I believe you.

682
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I won't explain anymore.

683
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,160
I apologize to you

684
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,240
for my behavior that day.

685
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,160
I sincerely apologize to you.

686
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,920
But we won't discuss that now.

687
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,680
A cornered beast will do something desperate.

688
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,320
Meiyuan was at her wits' end.

689
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,320
Now I suspect that her child

690
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
was hidden by her on purpose.

691
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
It's just a guess,

692
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,920
and needs proof.

693
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,800
The biggest beneficiary of

694
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,240
the child's disappearance is she.

695
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,120
But if anything were to happen

696
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,560
to the child

697
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,480
or if he was to go missing,

698
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,360
each of us

699
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,800
would bear an inescapable responsibility.

700
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,000
We still needs evidence.

701
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,840
The police are more experienced than we are.

702
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,640
They will have a more professional inference.

703
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,320
Cooperate with the investigation later,

704
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,960
and you don't have to say your guesses,

705
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,000
so as not to affect the police's judgment.

706
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,920
We are Ms. Lan's

707
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,840
attorneys.

708
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Yesterday, I was also entrusted by

709
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,400
Ms. Lan to go to Mr. Hu's house

710
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
to talk to his wife, Mrs. Zheng

711
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,280
about relevant provisions of inheritance.

712
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,320
When you went there,

713
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,360
did you have any conflict

714
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,960
with Mrs. Zheng?

715
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,520
No.

716
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,600
So did you see the child at that time?

717
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,320
Yes. The child was right beside us.

718
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,560
Later because of crying,

719
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,440
a nanny

720
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,680
went to look after the child.

721
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,680
Policemen,

722
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,960
this child's disappearance

723
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
must be related to her mother,

724
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,840
Zheng Meiyuan.

725
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
I suggest investigating Zheng Meiyuan's

726
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,640
all social relationships.

727
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
There must be clues.

728
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,040
She also has a driver named Yan Bin.

729
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Investigate him! Quickly!

730
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,960
Attorney Tang, how to handle a case?

731
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,480
How to conduct an investigation?

732
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,440
The police have their own arrangements.

733
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,000
You sit down first.

734
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,520
Yes, I know.

735
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,880
I know.

736
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,440
You sit down!

737
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
There is no time.

738
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,440
Policemen,

739
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,360
this is not an

740
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
ordinary missing child case.

741
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,199
The circumstances behind this case

742
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,199
are very complicated.

743
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,600
Now I suspect that the child's

744
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,920
mother, Zheng Meiyuan,

745
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,600
deliberately hid the child.

746
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,199
What is the basis for your suspicion?

747
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,360
Do you know

748
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,600
where the child disappeared?

749
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,440
No. No matter where this child

750
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
went missing,

751
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,080
Zheng Miyuan

752
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,800
must know the real situation.

753
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
You believe me!

754
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,480
If we not

755
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,239
find this kid quickly,

756
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:32,719
the child

757
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,120
will be dangerous.

758
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,760
A child of several months

759
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,639
can't talk and walk.

760
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
If someone hides on purpose,

761
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,800
it's very difficult to find,

762
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,400
and besides,

763
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,400
the source said

764
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,639
that the child disappeared in the square.

765
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,719
We are investigating the monitoring.

766
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,679
It will take time.

767
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,679
What I mean is,

768
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,239
why can't we

769
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,400
just investigate Zheng Meiyuan directly?

770
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,800
She must know something.

771
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,840
What is your relationship with the child?

772
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,360
I have no relationship with him.

773
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,320
She is a lawyer,

774
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,120
and the child is a friend's child.

775
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,280
Sorry, policemen.

776
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,320
No matter whose

777
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,600
child it is,

778
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,440
he is just a child who has no capacity for

779
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
civil conduct and is at

780
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
the mercy of others.

781
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,360
What she means...

782
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,120
She means

783
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
the longer the time goes on,

784
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,760
the more dangerous the child may be.

785
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,000
If something happens,

786
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,080
may be...

787
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,800
Whether it is out of public opinion or

788
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,200
one's own conscience,

789
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,680
we can't even bear the consequences.

790
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,400
That's what we mean.

791
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,120
We must try our best to find it.

792
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,360
Yes.

793
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,320
Then we won't disturb you.

794
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,080
We will go.

795
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,760
Okay.

796
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,400
Keep in touch.

797
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,080
Okay.

798
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,560
What were you doing?

799
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,080
Could you just calm down?

800
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,000
Listen to me. It's not...

801
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,040
It is not just the one possibility

802
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
you're thinking of, you know?

803
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,720
His biological father felt

804
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
that the matter was exposed

805
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,680
and picked up the child.

806
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,600
Is it possible?

807
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,960
Or it is really unfortunate

808
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,240
that he was targeted by those

809
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,720
who abducted and trafficked children.

810
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,680
Is it possible?

811
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
You're right.

812
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,080
We need evidence.

813
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,880
So whenever Zheng Meiyuan speaks up,

814
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,600
things will turn around.

815
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,920
How could Zheng Meiyuan

816
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,560
possibly speak up?

817
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
Hu doesn't have much time left.

818
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,720
Now, she only needs to hide

819
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,880
the child for a while.

820
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,720
When Hu dies,

821
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,120
she will be able to inherit shares.

822
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,720
It was our

823
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,800
repeated negotiations that

824
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,040
drove her to the brink.

825
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,120
If she really wants

826
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
to use this child

827
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,120
to secure her best interests.

828
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,960
She even...

829
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,120
Of course,

830
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,560
I don't want to make such vicious assumptions about a mother,

831
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
But what if this possibility

832
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,600
were to materialize?

833
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,440
Do not allow your personal feelings

834
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,800
to lead you into

835
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,880
such dire speculation. Okay?

836
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,080
Attorney Tang Yingying,

837
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,480
You've always been one

838
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,440
to meet every challenge head-on.

839
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,360
This matter is a test for you.

840
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,360
You give me. I'll go and find her.

841
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,080
Who?

842
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,520
Zheng Meiyuan!

843
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,320
Is it useful for you to find her?

844
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,120
You've been turned down by her

845
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,000
enough times already.

846
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
I'll go.

847
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,520
You? Yes!

848
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,360
You go and she will speak up

849
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,720
and she will tell you the truth?

850
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,960
Instead of being here

851
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,840
and talking to you,

852
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
I'd be better off

853
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,640
saying something that might change her mind.

854
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,080
You stop!

855
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,480
I'll go find Lan.

856
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,480
Okay, then if there is

857
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,080
any compromise on her side,

858
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,000
you can contact me at any time.

859
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,880
If there is any situation on your side,

860
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,800
you should also tell me.

861
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
I hope I can see

862
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,480
Director Kang's true strength this time.

863
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,000
And hope that they can withstand

864
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,440
the trials of human nature.

865
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,480
OK.

866
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,840
Test it.

867
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,960
Excuse me. Coming through.

868
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,600
Dad!

869
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,640
Dad!

870
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,560
Doctor, what's wrong?

871
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,080
Dad.

872
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
What's wrong? Doctotr?

873
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,120
What's wrong?

874
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,840
What happened?

875
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,880
Please wait outside.

876
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,080
This way please.

877
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,080
Where's Attorney Tang?

878
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,080
She is busy.

879
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,040
She is busy looking for your child.

880
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,560
Nicole, you're waiting here.

881
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,200
Let me talk to Aunt Tang.

882
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,120
How is Mr. Hu's situation now?

883
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,400
He's undergoing emergency treatment at the hospital.

884
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Life and death are unpredictable.

885
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,400
Sister,

886
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Now let's make a hypothesis.

887
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,880
Suppose Meiyuan and someone else

888
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,080
have a baby,

889
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,600
this matter is arranged by you

890
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,000
and the forged

891
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,920
paternity test

892
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,160
was also arranged by you.

893
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,600
The scheme you devised was

894
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,360
to become the largest shareholder of

895
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
Lanhu Group

896
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,880
after Mr. Hu's passing.

897
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,440
So...

898
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,760
Your purpose from beginning

899
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,880
to end is just the company.

900
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,960
Yingying,

901
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,720
You seem to be

902
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,440
my attorney, right?

903
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,760
So I'm now

904
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,120
in your shoes,

905
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,440
assuming for you.

906
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,520
I have another hypothesis.

907
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,880
Suppose Meiyuan's child

908
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,840
went missing,

909
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,840
then the paternity test

910
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,880
in your hand is a piece of waste paper.

911
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,480
But in Meiyuan's hand,

912
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,880
there is a certificate of paternity confirming that

913
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,960
Hu Yaozu is

914
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,840
the biological son of Mr. Hu.

915
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,120
Because of the disappearance of the child,

916
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,760
you can't falsify it now,

917
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,280
so

918
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
what leverage do we have?

919
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,320
Talk to Meiyuan.

920
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,200
What on earth

921
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,560
just happened?

922
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,360
My second hypothesis happens.

923
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,400
Meiyuan has called the police.

924
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,040
The child was missing.

925
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,080
how much

926
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,440
did Lan give you?

927
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
Let you work so hard for her.

928
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,640
Ms. Cheng,

929
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,080
you used wrong method.

930
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,120
What do you mean?

931
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,320
Firstly,

932
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,640
report false cases.

933
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,640
The police will impose detention for

934
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,800
five to ten days

935
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
and a fine.

936
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,840
As for forging paternity test certificates

937
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,080
and defrauding property inheritance rights,

938
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,640
this is even more serious.

939
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,400
Say whatever you want.

940
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,760
It is a fact that the child is missing now.

941
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,320
Have you ever seen a mother who

942
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,760
really lost her child?

943
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,280
They will search around

944
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,440
the streets like madmen,

945
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,640
for fear that they will

946
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
miss their children.

947
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,840
No one sitting at home

948
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,720
waiting for news.

949
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,800
No, I haven't seen.

950
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,000
I also looked for.

951
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm tired.

952
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,600
I went home and rest until it's dark.

953
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,720
If you represent Lan

954
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,400
to negotiate with me,

955
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
300 million

956
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,840
is my condition.

957
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,120
I suspect that Meiyuan's child

958
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,360
was deliberately hidden by her.

959
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,560
So sister,

960
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,240
as long as you tell the police

961
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,680
everything you know

962
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,760
about the child,

963
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,040
then the police will turn the direction of investigation

964
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,720
to Zheng Meiyuan.

965
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,360
I believe that this will be of

966
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,720
great help to find the child as

967
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,960
soon as possible.

968
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,280
The child is the one you carried for ten months

969
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
and gave birth to.

970
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,800
That's your flesh and blood.

971
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,760
Have you ever thought for him?

972
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,160
One day the child grew up,

973
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
and he knew that from the moment he was born,

974
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,600
he was plotted.

975
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,600
What would he think?

976
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay, let's not talk that.

977
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,080
Let's talk now.

978
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,920
Such a small baby,

979
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,160
eating, drinking, crying and shouting,

980
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,760
is the normal state of babies.

981
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,360
I don't care where you put him.

982
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,640
In anyone's house,

983
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,480
there is such a child out of thin air.

984
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,280
Wouldn't the neighbors

985
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
ask about it?

986
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,040
Wouldn't the neighbors call the police?

987
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,520
Would the person next to him

988
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,440
not let the child cry

989
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,760
out of fear

990
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,520
and cover the child's mouth with his hand?

991
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,640
Is it possible?

992
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,480
From the moment the child was born,

993
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,400
it was you

994
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,440
and that nanny who looked after him.

995
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,760
Who's looking after

996
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,520
the child now?

997
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,960
Stranger.

998
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,560
Will the child be afraid?

999
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,960
Will he cry his heart out?

1000
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,040
He'll want his mother.

1001
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,920
How would those around him treat him?

1002
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,200
Will they clamp their hands tighter

1003
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,440
over the child's mouth?

1004
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,400
You know,

1005
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,440
the strength of an adult

1006
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,520
against a baby,

1007
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,000
there is a risk of suffocation.

1008
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Even those you know well

1009
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,040
may not be trustworthy.

1010
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:17,920
Sister,

1011
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,320
Mr. Hu is in critical condition now,

1012
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,960
so we don't have much time left.

1013
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,680
While the worst outcome

1014
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,640
has yet to materialize,

1015
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,560
we still have a chance to change.

1016
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,120
Give me a moment.

1017
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm gonna think.

1018
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,880
Three minutes.

1019
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,880
I'll wait for you.

1020
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,520
Distant relatives?

1021
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,720
Fellow villagers?

1022
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,080
The person Yan Bin introduced to you?

1023
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,960
Do you believe him?

1024
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,520
The person you paid to hire, right?

1025
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,320
If he knows that this child

1026
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,440
is Mr. Hu's son,

1027
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,800
will he blackmail you again?

1028
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,280
Want a higher price?

1029
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000
If someone else offers a higher price,

1030
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,440
or they want to sell the child directly,

1031
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,560
is this possible?

1032
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,960
Two years ago,

1033
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,400
I have handled one

1034
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,760
child trafficking case,

1035
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,400
a two-year-old

1036
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,480
little boy,

1037
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,200
because of parental negligence,

1038
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,520
was abducted by a fellow villager.

1039
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,560
His parents are anxious to look around.

1040
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,200
The fellow villager panicked,

1041
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,680
and he can't control the child.

1042
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,720
Crying and shouting.

1043
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,360
Out of fear, he abandoned the child,

1044
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,080
just abandoned the child to the side of the road.

1045
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,360
You know when the police,

1046
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,840
found that child,

1047
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,840
the child's body was floating on

1048
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,400
the river pond nearby.

1049
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,760
Don't talk!

1050
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,680
Your thought is very likely

1051
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,480
to decide your child's life.

1052
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,960
You're his mother,

1053
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,600
so his life is in your hands.

1054
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,000
Understand?

1055
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,280
He Na and Yan Bin's fellow villagers.

1056
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,960
She took the baby to the suburbs

1057
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,800
Name,

1058
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,160
address, and phone number.
