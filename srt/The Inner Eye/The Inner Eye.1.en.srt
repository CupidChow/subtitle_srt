3
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,600
Quiet.

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
Quiet, please.

5
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,520
Here is the hospital.

6
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
Please don't make any noise.

7
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,280
No pictures here.

8
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
You can't shoot here.

9
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Attorney Kang is here. Let's go.

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,200
Attorney Kang.

11
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Why did Zhang Yi commit suicide?

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,880
Quiet.

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Quiet, please.

14
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Did Ms. Zhang suffer from

15
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,600
the pressure of public opinion?

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
What happened in the trial?

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Can you tell us

18
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,760
the whole story?

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,840
Please cooperate.

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,360
Okay?

21
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Attorney Tang.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,640
You were reported

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,720
as a defense lawyer for

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,400
Shi's alleged compulsory indecency case,

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
and you were suspected of violating

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,240
the professional norms of lawyers.

27
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,120
Did you?

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
No.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,520
When representing the case,

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,320
did you guide the client

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,280
to create behaviors that were unfavorable to

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,600
the victim Zhang's public opinion?

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,840
No.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Pen.

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,480
Attorney Tang. Do you think

36
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,040
you are a good lawyer?

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
I am

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
a conscientious lawyer

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,480
who strives for

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,480
the best interests of my client

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,440
according to law.

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,440
[Two Months Ago]

43
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,120
We claim that due to Shen Jing's

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,200
personal debt problem,

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
the defendant Ms. Qiao proposed

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
and both parties reached an agreement

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,600
on divorce.

48
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,960
According to the divorce agreement,

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,600
Mr. Shen

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,640
transferred all the equities

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,000
of Dongyuan Group

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,519
to Ms. Qiao.

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,920
And

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,800
the two sides agreed that after Mr. Shen

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480
solved the debt problem,

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,200
Ms. Qiao

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,720
would return all the equities.

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
Now Mr. Shen

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
has solved the debt problem,

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,400
but Ms. Qiao

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,960
refused to return the corresponding equities.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,800
So,

63
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,680
Mr. Shen asked the court

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,560
to cancel the matters about equity transfer

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,200
in the original divorce agreement.

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
Defendant, please give your reply.

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,640
I'd like to invite

68
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,240
my attorney.

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
The contents of

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
their divorce agreement about

71
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,080
the ownership

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,360
of custody of their son

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,360
and the division of property

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,159
are the true expression of their will

75
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,120
reached through

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,280
equal consultation,

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,640
and there are no revocable reasons

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,760
such as fraud and coercion.

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
So the agreement on property division

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,040
in the divorce agreement

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
cannot be arbitrarily denied.

82
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,400
How is it not fraud?

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,240
Please sit down, plaintiff.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,680
Before the divorce, we agreed that

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,640
she would return the equities to me

86
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,920
when the problem was solved.

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,520
She cheated me of my money

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
and then disappeared.

89
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Ms. Qiao's disappearance

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,960
was entirely for self-protection

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,080
and she had to avoid

92
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
meeting Mr. Shen.

93
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,840
After the divorce,

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
Mr. Shen repeatedly harassed

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
and threatened Ms. Qiao and her family.

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
We have provided

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
the alarm records to the court

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,520
before the trial.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,320
See pages 6 to 9

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
of the evidence for details.

101
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,320
She lied to me.

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Bitch.

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,720
She's been setting me up.

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,760
Plaintiff. Watch your language.

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,240
And Mr. Shen

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
suffers from severe alcohol dependence.

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,520
He has repeatedly

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
committed domestic violence

109
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,040
against Ms. Qiao after being drunk.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
We have submitted

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
an examination report

112
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
to the court before the trial.

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,640
See Evidence 5 for details.

114
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,040
Ms. Qiao

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,360
has sought legal advice

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,159
from me

117
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,000
since the first domestic violence.

118
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
And I suggested that she go for an examination

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,480
and keep the examination record.

120
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Ms. Qiao

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,760
chose to divorce because

122
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
she couldn't stand domestic violence.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,560
She needs time to repair

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,400
the wounds

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,560
caused by this marriage

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
and money

127
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,160
to support her and her son.

128
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
The plaintiff claimed that

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,840
the divorce agreement

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,960
should be revoked because of fraud,

131
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,880
but failed to

132
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,480
provide evidence to prove it.

133
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
The plaintiff should bear

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
the adverse consequences of failing to provide evidence.

135
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,360
Both parties are

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
persons with full capacity for civil conduct.

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
The signing of their agreement is also

138
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,040
an expression of the true meaning of both parties

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
and does not violate laws, regulations

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,080
and public order and good customs.

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
So

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
it should be recognized as legal and valid.

143
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Qiao Wei.

144
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,480
I misjudged you.

145
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
This isn't the end.

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,680
Attorney Tang.

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Wait for me in the car.

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Attorney Tang.

149
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
I appreciate your help.

150
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Do you know there is a kind of snake

151
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,520
called copperhead?

152
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
It is highly toxic, deadly

153
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,920
and extremely dangerous,

154
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,360
but it is very good at

155
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,240
disguising itself

156
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
and hiding itself

157
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
in dead leaves.

158
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,080
Are you telling me a story?

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,080
It is you.

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,120
When you told me the story,

161
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,680
you hid

162
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
the most important part, didn't you?

163
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
Divorce is actually your plan.

164
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,720
You just want to

165
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
divide his property.

166
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,159
You just want to

167
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,480
complete the double cutting

168
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,560
of family and property.

169
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,000
Am I right?

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,680
But these injuries are real.

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,280
Attorney Tang.

172
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
We are both women.

173
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,960
You should understand me.

174
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,640
If we win the lawsuit,

175
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,920
we can both get

176
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,080
the desired result.

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,040
You don't need to get to the bottom of it.

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Well.

179
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,200
It's still a long way to go.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,080
Behave yourself.

181
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,760
I found the files of the three bribery cases

182
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,680
you asked for.

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Do you know

184
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
how hard I worked?

185
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Director Chen, you are awesome.

186
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,559
If I win the lawsuit, buy you a drink.

187
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,039
Do you have any plans

188
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,960
for tomorrow afternoon?

189
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,159
Peilin. I should meet

190
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,320
at the detention center.

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Do you need anything?

192
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,480
Master, did Qiao Wei

193
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,160
hide something from us

194
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,400
just now in court?

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Hello, aunt.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Yingying.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Will you be there for

198
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
Cao Sheng's wedding at eight this evening?

199
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,680
Your father and his family will come

200
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,960
to say hello to you.

201
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
OK, I promise I'll go.

202
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,680
Didn't you quit smoking?

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,840
Master.

204
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,800
Take your clothes?

205
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,440
Yeah.

206
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,400
What a beautiful bride.

207
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,240
You want to get married?

208
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,280
I won't marry Qian Peng

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,280
until I earn enough money.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,600
Master.

211
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Is it your relative

212
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,040
who got married today?

213
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,120
My cousin.

214
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
According to the custom here,

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,840
how much is the gift money?

216
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
I took 20 thousand yuan.

217
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
So much.

218
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,800
My little aunt and my uncle

219
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,480
used to be

220
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
very kind to me and my mother.

221
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Some feelings

222
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,520
cannot be measured with money.

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,640
There's still time.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm going to change.

225
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Yingying.

226
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,160
Yingying.

227
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Aunt.

228
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,360
Yingying, there you are.

229
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,880
Just waiting for you.

230
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,720
The last time I saw you was at grandma's

231
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,760
birthday party at the beginning of the year.

232
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,880
We all miss you.

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeah.

234
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,560
Stop shaking me.

235
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,400
Come on.

236
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,520
Big red envelope. Congratulations.

237
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,160
You shouldn't have.

238
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,920
You are too attentive.

239
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,440
This is what I should do.

240
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,120
Yingying. Hurry in and have a rest.

241
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
Come on, I'll take you in.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,840
I'll go first.

243
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,800
Su Mei

244
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,280
originally wanted to come over.

245
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,360
I didn't agree.

246
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
She won't be

247
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,800
allowed to attend

248
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,760
the Jiang family's events.

249
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,600
Go.

250
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,680
Come on. Shi Li.

251
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,920
Let me introduce you.

252
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
These are

253
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,280
Sheng's uncles.

254
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,360
He is

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,680
the successor of Aina Group.

256
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,480
Mr. Shi.

257
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,560
He

258
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,040
sponsored the souvenirs

259
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,960
for all the female guests.

260
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,240
Li.

261
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,280
Nice to meet you.

262
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,920
Take a picture for us.

263
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,320
Well.

264
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,280
Come on.

265
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,440
Uncle, stand by me.

266
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
Zhang Yi. Where is the headdress?

267
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,520
Here you are.

268
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,920
So beautiful.

269
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Thank you.

270
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
Yaya.

271
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,240
You're getting married today.

272
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
So reluctant to part with you.

273
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,640
Me too.

274
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,520
Come on. Gao Ya.

275
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,160
Take a picture of you.

276
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,720
Look at the camera.

277
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,320
Tilt your head.

278
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
I want to take one too.

279
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,320
Well. Come on.

280
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,840
Three, two, one, laugh.

281
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,040
Let me see. Do I look good?

282
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah.

283
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,360
Wow.

284
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,120
So beautiful.

285
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Bride, bridesmaid, are you ready?

286
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,920
The ceremony will begin soon.

287
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,240
Here we come.

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
Here we come.

289
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,720
Here we come.

290
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Let's go, Yaya.

291
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
Be careful.

292
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,000
Zhang Yi.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,760
Remember to take my bouquet.

294
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,920
Well. I'm coming.

295
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,520
Zhang Yi. We'll go first.

296
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,640
Well. I'll be right there.

297
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm not much of a drinker.

298
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,000
Help me later.

299
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
I'll drink it for you.

300
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,240
Come on.

301
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,240
My brothers and sisters.

302
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,720
Come on, let's have a drink together.

303
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Well.

304
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,800
Thank you

305
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,520
for coming to my son's wedding.

306
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,120
Come on, cheers.

307
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,800
Thank you.

308
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
Enjoy yourselves.

309
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,800
We'll go over there.

310
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
We'll make a toast over there.

311
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,760
OK. Busy with your affairs.

312
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,360
OK.

313
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,600
Have a good talk with Yingying.

314
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,960
Yingying.

315
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
It's been a long time since we met.

316
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,800
How are you recently?

317
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm fine.

318
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,000
Xiaoying, come here.

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
A toast to your sister.

320
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,800
Let's have a drink.

321
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
Yingying. Drink juice.

322
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,600
Go home for dinner

323
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,960
when you are free.

324
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,440
Aunt Su wants to see you.

325
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,080
After all,

326
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,280
we are family.

327
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,240
Home?

328
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
Whose home?

329
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,400
Mr. Jiang.

330
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,600
My mother died a long time ago.

331
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,400
You forgot?

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,160
I didn't expect

333
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,200
you to be so angry

334
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,040
after all these years.

335
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,360
Anyway,

336
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm your father.

337
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
Don't say that.

338
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Your daughter's surname is Jiang,

339
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,840
not Tang.

340
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,280
Biting nails

341
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,960
is a bad habit.

342
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,600
In case of fungal infection,

343
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,960
you may get osteomyelitis.

344
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,600
If it is serious,

345
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
you may have an amputation.

346
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,240
You are learning the piano.

347
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,040
You can't play the piano if your hand hurts.

348
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,960
OK,

349
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,560
the exciting moment

350
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
is coming.

351
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,640
All single

352
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,160
women

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,840
can come to

354
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
the stage.

355
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,760
OK.

356
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,440
Next,

357
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240
the couple will pass

358
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,760
this bouquet of flowers

359
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,160
symbolizing happiness

360
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
to you.

361
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,640
Friends.

362
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,720
Are you ready?

363
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah.

364
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,200
Let's count down together.

365
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,400
Three, two, one.

366
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,000
Throw.

367
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,040
Congratulations.

368
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,520
Lady, congratulations.

369
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,800
Friends.

370
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's give applause

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
to this lady, shall we?

372
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,920
Well.

373
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
I wish this lady

374
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,840
happiness forever

375
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,480
and can walk into

376
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,600
the marriage hall

377
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,320
with her beloved one.

378
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,920
Thank you.

379
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,560
As a lawyer,

380
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,080
I am used to balancing and judging

381
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,160
everything I see and hear

382
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,280
with reason.

383
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,520
The balance of law should not be tilted.

384
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
But my father's balance

385
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,200
always leans towards another family.

386
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,720
The balance of affection

387
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,000
in my heart

388
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,960
has

389
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,840
never found

390
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,160
the fulcrum of balance.

391
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,120
Don't help me.

392
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,400
I can do it myself.

393
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Why do you drink so much today?

394
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
I am very happy.

395

I'm fine.

397
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm fine.

398
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,560
My sister is getting married today.

399
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,320
I am very happy.

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Where is my cousin?

401
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,080
Help me to see my cousin.

402
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,040
Don't let her drink too much.

403
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
Well. Go.

404
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,120
Come on.

405
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,240
I left your cosmetic bag here.

Come and see us when you're done.

407

Just go. Thank you.

Go ahead.

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Go ahead.

410

We're going to find Yaya.

411
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
Hello, can I help you?

412
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
Call me a taxi.

413
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,760
I want to go home.

414
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,320
Well.

415
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,720
Hello.

416
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
I need to call a taxi.

417
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
[Police Reception Hall]

418
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I want to report a case.

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,600
Someone wants to invade me.

420
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,760
What's your name?

421
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm Zhang Yi.

422
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,640
Tell me more about the situation.

423
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,480
In a hotel lounge,

424
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,400
he

425
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,200
tried to invade me.

426
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,840
What is your relationship with him?

427
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,000
He is Shi Li,

428
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,960
vice president of Aina Group.

429
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,440
At my cousin's wedding,

430
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,640
he was the best man

431
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,760
and I was the maid of honor.

432
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,240
Zhang Yi.

433
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,880
Please describe

434
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,080
the whole story in detail.

435
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,560
At the wedding, I was not very sober

436
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,800
after drinking.

437
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,800
I didn't want to

438
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,640
go into that room.

439
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
As soon as I went in,

440
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,880
he pulled me

441
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
to sit on his lap.

442
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,440
Later,

443
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,160
he pressed me onto the sofa,

444
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,120
kissed me,

445
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
grabbed my hands

446
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,080
and covered my mouth.

447
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,600
Let me go, I beg you.

448
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
I told him not to.

449
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,760
But he didn't listen at all.

450
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,800
After that...

451
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Please, Shi Li.

452
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,680
He tore my dress.

453
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,040
Relax. It's safe here.

454
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,080
How did you leave

455
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,840
that room?

456
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
I pushed him away

457
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,560
and ran out.

458
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,440
OK.

459
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,440
Now I need you

460
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
to cooperate with two things.

461
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,040
First, follow

462
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,680
the female colleague

463
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
beside me

464
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,520
to do a

465
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,560
biological sample extraction.

466
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,840
Second,

467
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,960
we need to seal this dress on you

468
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
as evidence.

469
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,840
No. Ms. Ren.

470
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
Attorney Tang is an independent lawyer.

471
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,680
Chen Jun Law Firm won't

472
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,440
interfere with her taking any cases.

473
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
It's not about the money.

474
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,080
Of course, I really

475
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
want to cooperate with Aina Group.

476
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,840
But

477
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,720
not interfering with her

478
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,800
making any decisions

479
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,760
is an agreement

480
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
we have already made.

481
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,520
Actually, I can introduce you

482
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,840
to other lawyers.

483
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
Beauty.

484
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,760
What tough case?

485
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,000
You look so serious.

486
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,000
Because of you.

487
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,840
The chairman of Aina Group

488
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,760
specifically asked you

489
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,640
to represent his son

490
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,800
in the case of compulsory indecency.

491
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,840
This kind of lawsuit has sufficient evidence

492
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,280
and no room for defense.

493
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,480
I won't take this case.

494
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,840
But she made

495
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,240
a very sincere offer.

496
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,920
Whatever your price.

497
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,760
They gave up

498
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,920
their strong team of lawyers

499
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
and came to me.

500
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,840
They must have made

501
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,120
some unusual demands.

502
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,720
Their demand is

503
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,480
a plea of innocence.

504
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,120
No wonder.

505
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,120
I can't take this case.

506
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,080
Wait a minute.

507
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,960
I'll send you the information

508
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
to have a look.

509
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,720
Reply before six o'clock

510
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,800
in the evening.

511
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,120
I sent you an email.

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320

515
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,720
does not know how to respect women.

516

That's ironic.

517
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,720
Actually, I think

518
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,680
what Aina Group needs now

519
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,800
is not a lawyer

520
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
but a crisis public relations team.

521
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,640
Stop.

522
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,800
What's the matter?

523
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,760
Director Chen will retire soon.

524
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,760
I think

587
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,200
the venue of your cousin's wedding,

588
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,560
and it is on the same day.

589
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,640
The maid of honor

590
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,680
at your cousin's wedding?

591
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
This is the exposed video

592
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
and hotel surveillance content.

593
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,600
Master.

594
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,520
Go back to the law firm.

595
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
[Chen Jun Law Firm]

596
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,880
Why?

597
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,080
I heard that you

598
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,360
became famous

599
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,840
because of

600
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,040
a controversial case

601
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
when you were in Hong Kong.

602
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
But you didn't hear that

603
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,200
I was threatened

604
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,280
and almost thrown with sulfuric acid

605
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,800
because of this case.

606
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,360
Do you regret it?

607
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,080
I was reckless

608
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
about everything

609
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,880
because of my passion.

610
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,800
I firmly believed in one sentence.

611
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
Bet, you may not win.

612
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,840
But if you don't bet,

613
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,920
you must lose.

614
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,040
Later, I discovered that

615
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
taking a case was not a gamble.

616
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,560
You are irresponsible

617
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
to your client

618
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
if you take the case rashly

619
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,040
without complete assurance.

620
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,040
I understand.

621
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
Without a big trump card,

622
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,600
there is not enough chance of winning.

623
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,520
I've thought about it. Peilin.

624
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,280
You have

625
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,480
full confidence now?

626
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,080
I will do my best

627
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,560
for my client.

628
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,920
Ms. Ren.

629
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,560
Attorney Tang

630
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,560
has decided to take the case

631
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
entrusted by you.

632
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,880
OK.

633
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
Attorney Kang.

634
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,480
Chen Jun Law Firm

635
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,040
invites you to

636
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,080
take over my position

637
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
with the utmost sincerity.

638
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,400
To tell the truth,

639
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
at my age

640
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,880
and physical condition,

641
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,920
I should take a long vacation

642
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
from work.

643
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Director Chen.

644
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,160
Thank you very much

645
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,760
for your timely help.

646
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,320
I appreciate your kindness.

647
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,920
But your position

648
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,000
is not suitable for me.

649
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,120
Professor Liang.

650
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,560
Please go ahead.

651
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,760
You must help me

652
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,600
with a case.

653
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,960
Sexual assault.

654
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,880
Please.

655
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,960
Your...

656
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,000
Your student.

657
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,680
Shenzhen, right?

658
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,760
Well.

659
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,040
Bye.

660
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,960
Attorney Tang.

661
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,800
Have we met somewhere?

662
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,920
It doesn't matter.

663
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,760
According to the victim's statement

664
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,960
and the evidence held by the prosecution,

665
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,640
the current situation

666
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,920
is very unfavorable to you.

667
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
At least three people at the scene

668
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,600
can prove that they heard

669
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
Zhang Yi's screams.

670
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,880
She

671
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,520
has more than one scar.

672
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,600
If you want to prove that

673
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,680
you didn't force her,

674
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,480
you need enough evidence

675
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,680
to support your statement.

676
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,360
I really didn't.

677
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
Trust me.

678
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,640
How can I

679
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,600
force others?

680
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,640
How can I?

681
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,440
My mother

682
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,720
has always taught me

683
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,960
to respect women.

684
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,480
Even

685
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
the female cleaning staff,

686
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,040
I have great respect for them.

687
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,880
Let me remind you.

688
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,760
You were drunk

689
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,000
and unconscious

690
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
that night, right?

691
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,440
Attorney Tang.

692
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,280
Attorney Tang.

693
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,520
Are you leaving

694
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,360
without asking anything?

695
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,560
Shi Li.

696
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,280
I was invited by Ms. Ren

697
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,720
at a high price.

698
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,280
I really want to help you.

699
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,880
If you don't trust me,

700
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,040
take precautions against me

701
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,440
and don't want to

702
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
be honest with me,

703
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,400
you will

704
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,480
screw up my work.

705
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,200
As soon as you graduated from abroad,

706
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,040
you entered the important department

707
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,920
of Aina Group.

708
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,320
You could have

709
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,120
a bright future.

710
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,160
But now?

711
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,800
Are you going to be charged with compulsory indecency

712
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,360
for the rest of your life?

713
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
I will cooperate with you. Attorney Tang.

714
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't admit this charge.

715
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,840
Think over

716
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
everything

717
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
about you and Zhang Yi.

718
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,080
Make it clear in detail.

719
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,480
And everything

720
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,400
that happened that night.

721
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,840
She...

722
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,000
She may want to be my girlfriend.

723
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
But I don't like her.

724
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,000
Do I look good?

725
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,320
Yeah.

726
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,760
So beautiful.

727
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
That night,

728
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,200
I drank a lot.

729
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,520
I can only say some things

730
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,280
that I still remember.

731
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,400
Can we win?

732
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,600
Shi Li.

733
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
I'll give you another piece of advice.

734
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,080
From now on,

735
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,560
everything you say to me

736
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,200
must be true.

737
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,280
I need your absolute trust

738
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,000
to win

739
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,680
this battle with you.

740
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,800
Do you understand what I'm saying?

741
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,280
As a consumer,

742
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
will you boycott a brand

743
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,520
because of such a thing?

744
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,320
At least it won't be

745
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,480
my first choice brand.

746
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,640
Save it.

747
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,800
Because it is my life's work.

748
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,080
I believe that the public relations team

749
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,040
of Aina Group

750
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,240
must have given

751
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,120
a perfect solution.

752
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
You met

753
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,680
and communicated with Shi Li.

754
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,640
Do you believe that he is innocent?

755
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,080
Innocence requires evidence.

756
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,800
We ask you

757
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,120
to be our defense lawyer.

758
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,560
You must believe that

759
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,680
he is innocent.

760
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,680
Ms. Ren.

761
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
I am your lawyer,

762
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,400
not your subordinate.

763
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,480
For Aina's sake,

764
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,760
Shi Li must be innocent.

765
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,720
Whatever it takes.

766
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,520
Find evidence.

767
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,680
Win the lawsuit.

768
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,800
I suggest that you consider the plan

769
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,440
put forward by

770
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,280
the public relations team

771
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,720
to separate Aina and Shi Li.

772
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,160
I am still considering it.

773
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,120
But I firmly believe that my son

774
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,080
is innocent.

775
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,280
He can't be

776
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
a sexual assault that

777
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
forcibly molests women.

778
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,160
Nonsense.

779
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,280
Look at the current public opinion.

780
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,960
Go with the flow.

781
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
Follow the trend blindly.

782
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,560
Nobody wants to know

783
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,440
what the truth is.

784
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,440
Ms. Ren.

785
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,480
I fully understand

786
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,639
your difficulties as a mother.

787
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,120
But public opinion needs

788
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,000
to be solved by public relations.

789
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,280
I also suggest you try to

790
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
divert the attention of public opinion first.

791
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,639
As for this case,

792
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,199
it takes time to

793
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,280
find a breakthrough

794
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
and relevant evidence.

795
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,360
Aina has no time.

796
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,239
Look.

797
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,719
Men cannot be judged by their looks.

798
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,280
She usually

799
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,920
ignores male teachers.

800
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,400
It turns out that her mind is all here.

801
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,120
Yeah. I didn't expect that.

802
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,719
Morning.

803
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,480
I heard that she is

804
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,720
a private high school teacher.

805
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,240
She can't teach students well.

806
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
She is dressed so revealing.

807
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,600
She is unworthy of being a teacher.

808
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Which school?

809
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,680
This way, please.

810
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,160
Hello. I'm Tang Yingying.

811
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,400
Ms. Tang. I've heard a lot about you.

812
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,160
Am I late?

813
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,360
No, you're not.

814
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,720
I arrived early.

815
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
What's more, it's more polite

816
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,080
to meet a lady.

817
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,000
Hello.

818
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,680
A cup of American coffee. A ham sandwich.

819
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,960
What would you like to drink?

820
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,760
I ordered it,

821
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
just like you ordered.

822
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I didn't expect our tastes

823
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
to coincide.

824
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,040
I was puzzled to see

825
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
the name of the victim's lawyer.

826
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,400
You once flourished in

827
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,600
Beijing Red Circle Law Firms.

828
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,040
But you came to Shenzhen

829
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,440
after you disappeared for a few years.

830
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,360
You haven't lost

831
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,400
for three years in a row.

832
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,200
Why did you take this case

833
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,320
as a defense lawyer

834
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,360
this time?

835
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,480
My question came first.

836
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,840
I did not come back.

837
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,960
I was just asked

838
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,400
by a respected elder

839
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,720
to help.

840
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,240
To be precise,

841
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm here as a legal adviser.

842
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:56,920
What about you?

843
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,920
Ms. Ren must have made an offer

844
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,200
that you can't refuse.

845
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,760
But I think, with your personality,

846
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,480
you shouldn't

847
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,000
do it for money, right?

848
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,160
You overestimate me.

849
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,000
I probably understand.

850
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,160
So you asked me today just to

851
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,760
apologize to the victim,

852
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
compensate for the loss

853
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,280
and get the victim's understanding.

854
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
How much money is

855
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,800
the famous Ms. Ren

856
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
going to take to settle this case?

857
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,920
That depends on

858
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,200
what price you intend to win

859
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,760
for your client.

860
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,600
Thank you.

861
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,720
Please enjoy yourself.

862
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,040
My client

863
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,400
has been hurt by words from relatives

864
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,800
and even family members.

865
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,560
She has started taking medicine.

866
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,200
So I'm afraid that no amount of money

867
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,160
can make up for it.

868
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,160
Everything has a price.

869
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,520
From the moment she called the police,

870
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,120
she should

871
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,600
have been prepared.

872
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,080
Do you mean

873
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880
victim condemnation?

874
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,120
You are too sensitive.

875
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm just stating the facts.

876
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,800
You are so cold-blooded.

877
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,360
I'm just being rational.

878
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
Regardless of whether my client

879
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,360
has committed compulsory indecency,

880
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,160
Ms. Zhang has been hurt

881
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,560
to some extent.

882
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,760
So the victim

883
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,720
can make

884
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,800
any request.

885
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,680
You also want to get more

886
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,840
financial compensation for the victim,

887
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,600
don't you?

888
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,200
Get the victim's understanding.

889
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,240
I have to communicate

890
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,840
with the victim before

891
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,000
I can answer this question.

892
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,640
Do it now.

893
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,640
You have ten minutes.

894
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,520
Wait for your news.

895
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,920
Hello.

896
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,800
Hello.

897
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,120
Master.

898
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,520
The public opinion about the case has reversed.

899
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,960
It was revealed that the bridesmaid

900
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,880
framed the best man

901
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,960
because she couldn't seduce him.

902
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,520
Look at the video

903
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,280
I sent you.

904
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,320
The obscene case has undergone a major reversal.

905
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,520
According to informed sources,

906
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,640
Zhang Yi, the victim of this case,

907
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
worked as a car model during her college years.

908
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,800
She has a bold style

909
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,240
and likes to make friends with rich people.

910
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
She and the best man

911
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
were introduced

912
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
by a blind date.

913
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,680
Your suggestion is good.

914
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
It worked very well.

915
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,560
Ms. Ren. Where did the news

916
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,800
on the Internet come from?

917
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,600
That's not important.

918
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,320
The important thing is that it is true,

919
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
not a fabrication.

920
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,960
Thank you. Attorney Tang.

921
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,840
Well.

922
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,120
You are so resourceful.

923
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
Stigma attack.

924
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,160
Manipulate public opinion.

925
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,240
This is how you come to me

926
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
to solve the problem?

927
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,120
You're ruining her,

928
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,280
okay?

929
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,800
I don't want to do it.

930
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,960
But I'm telling you,

931
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,360
my client

932
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,560
won't accept the settlement now.

933
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,280
The only appeal is that

934
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,320
Shi Li accepts legal sanctions.

935
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,800
Attorney Tang.

936
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,120
See you in court.

937
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,920
Your affairs

938
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
have a bad influence on the internet now.

939
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,160
What are you going to do?

940
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Sir.

941
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,600
I have caused trouble to the school.

942
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,680
The lawyer Kang you introduced

943
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,240
said that he would help me solve it as soon as possible.

944
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,120
But as the principal,

945
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,760
I have to consider

946
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,440
the reputation of our school.

947
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,560
Teacher Zhang, you don't have to

948
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,480
come to school these days.

949
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,320
Men cannot be judged by their looks.

950
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
She usually

951
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,440
ignores male teachers.

952
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,120
It turns out that her mind is all here.

953
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,000
Is she really a teacher?

954
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,080
Oh, my god.

955
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,440
I can't believe that

956
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,600
she is such a person.

957
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,040
Give it to me.
