[EP09]

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,720
This is from my friend,

4
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,039
his own winery.

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
Made from Pinot Noir grapes.

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,600
Try it.

7
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,120
This wine doesn't need to breathe?

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
This one doesn't.

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,160
Let's eat.

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,120
Try a bowl of the rib soup first.

11
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,280
It's got black beans,

12
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,600
corn, and lotus root.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
It's very nourishing.

14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,960
Helps your wound heal.

15
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,360
Go on.

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
I'm really curious.

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,960
A high-quality guy like you,

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
such a great catch,

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
how can you still be single?

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,360
Is that a compliment,

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,480
or an interrogation?

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,840
Just curious.

23
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
I've had two girlfriends.

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,600
First one lasted two years.

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
We parted peacefully.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,360
She's married with kids now.

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,200
The second...

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Five years ago...

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
She died in a car crash.

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
She's gone.

31
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
Honestly,

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,720
these past five years,

33
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
I haven't met anyone

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
who made my heart flutter.

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
Until I met you.

36
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,320
Can you let her go?

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
Five years.

38
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,040
What can be forgotten is forgotten.

39
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,560
What can't, becomes memory.

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,440
Some things you just have to let go.

41
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,920
Some burdens you have to put down.

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,880
It's fine, really.

44
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm really sorry.

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,680
That bag looks fake.

46
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,520
Yeah.

47
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,760
It's fake.

48
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,280
Probably around five thousand.

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,040
- Just doesn't look real.  - Exactly.

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,560
That bag...

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,960
Nice, right?

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,640
Just one used bag,

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,600
costs tens of thousands.

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
A little logo

55
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,920
is worth that much?

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
It's the logo that holds value.

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
And it's a classic.

58
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Never depreciates.

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,120
Alright, stop looking.

60
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,600
Every time we pass by this year,

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
you stare at that bag.

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,760
Got it.

63
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,880
I don't want it. Return it.

64
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,120
But you like it.

65
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Don't worry, I checked it out.

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
This high-end replica shop

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
uses original factory

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
hardware and leather.

69
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
Exactly the same.

70
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
It looks real. See?

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
Return it, please.

72
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,560
Spending tens of thousands

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,159
on a used bag. Worth it?

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,560
Have you ever thought,

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,720
that money could

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
tile the bathroom floor?

77
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,560
Can you wear bathroom tiles

78
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
on your shoulder?

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm not against you spending.

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,200
Money should be spent wisely.

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Right now,

82
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,240
this is my priority.

83
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,640
[Alipay received:]

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,440
[thirty-six thousand yuan.]

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll tell you, shops like this,

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,040
wait six months, half price.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Qian Peng, for things you truly love,

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,360
if you delay getting them,

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
the joy will be greatly reduced.

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,320
Don't you get it?

91
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,320
Thanks.

92
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,920
Thank you.

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,840
I checked out offices today

94
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,320
in Nanshan District.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
Rent is too high.

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,440
The tech park is pretty good, though.

97
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,480
A bit far from downtown,

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,159
but lower rent, nice environment.

99
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,400
Plus policy benefits.

100
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
What do you think?

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,760
Look at this.

102
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
This is the platform's

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,520
user management fees.

104
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
And also...

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,800
This.

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,320
This is our investment profit share.

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
Current profit

108
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,520
has doubled from before.

109
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Both sums are ours.

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,760
Conservative estimate,

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
at least two million profit.

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,160
Excited?

113
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,000
Xiaoyun, I have to remind you,

114
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,240
all investments have risks.

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Especially high-return projects.

116
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,040
There's no free lunch.

117
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,840
I think

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,000
you should manage the risk.

119
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,200
What's on your mind?

120
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,520
I'm thinking,

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
we need to rent an office,

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
and we have to live...

123
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,840
What if we take out

124
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,440
the investment and profits?

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,760
That could buy us

126
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,360
a small condo in Futian.

127
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,320
A small condo?

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Could you think bigger?

129
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,880
In a few months,

130
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,680
we can buy

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,320
a big place in Shenzhen Bay.

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,560
Are you crazy? Shenzhen Bay?

133
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,120
We can't afford that.

134
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
That's exactly where we'll buy.

135
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
In a few months,

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:19,800
we'll go

137
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
look at houses together.

138
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
Don't you like the sea?

139
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,520
Get a big apartment

140
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,680
with an ocean view.

141
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,840
We don't have local residency.

142
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
How about this.

143
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,280
You take some money out first.

144
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
My parents also set aside

145
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,240
some renovation money.

146
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,120
I'll buy a small condo first.

147
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,919
Later, when we earn more

148
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,679
and get residency,

149
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,840
we'll buy a big one.

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,760
Trust me.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
Next year, a Shenzhen Bay penthouse.

152
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
Solves everything at once.

153
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
The bigger, the better.

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
Won't let you settle for less.

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,920
Look.

156
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
All this money...

157
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,440
Doesn't it seem too easy?

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
You stared at a bag

159
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,840
for two years, but couldn't buy it.

160
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,880
Rich people have

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
hundreds of bags,

162
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,640
like a second-hand shop,

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,960
collecting dust in closets.

164
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
I want you

165
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
to live like that too.

166
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
Live in the best house,

167
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,880
carry the priciest bags.

168
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
And Yunpeng Capital

169
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,760
isn't the first of its kind.

170
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,560
There are so many

171
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
investment apps before it.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,680
Think how much they've soared.

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,200
If Yunpeng Capital today

174
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,880
was a capital-guaranteed product,

175
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,960
and you didn't invest,

176
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,720
watching others get rich...

177
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
People like us,

178
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,160
how do we get a good life?

179
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Brains and hard work.

180
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
I refuse to believe

181
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,200
you and I can't have

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
that good life.

183
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,760
Alright, alright.

184
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
I might lie to the world,

185
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
but never to you.

186
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,280
We're riding the wave now.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,640
The next big earners

188
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,520
will be us.

189
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,200
Our good life is coming.

190
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,480
What did I say?

191
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,720
Another gain. Look.

192
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
Xiaoyun, lately

193
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
your work has been good.

194
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,200
And progressing quickly.

195
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,720
Have you considered

196
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
handling cases independently?

197
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
Maybe later.

198
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,120
Qian Peng's career

199
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
just started.

200
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
I want to fully support him.

201
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,040
You want to rely on Qian Peng

202
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,640
to make your life easier?

203
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
But is Qian Peng

204
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
really reliable?

205
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,440
I also want, like you

206
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,520
or Attorney Dai,

207
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
to build a career.

208
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
But an easier life

209
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
is fine too.

210
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,440
Xiaoyun.

211
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,840
A career...

212
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,640
It's something everyone deserves.

213
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,520
Because sometimes,

214
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,880
it's even more reliable

215
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,000
than we are.

216
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Let's go. Time to work.

217
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,640
Okay, I understand.

218
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,760
Client says traffic's bad.

219
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
They'll be 15 minutes late.

220
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,440
We'll wait.

221
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,840
I'll go make a quick call.

222
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,800
Go ahead. Don't be too long.

223
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Okay.

224
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,640
Mom, about the investment,

225
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,720
what do you and Dad think?

226
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,640
We've thought about it.

227
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,120
We're not comfortable with it.

228
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
Why aren't you comfortable?

229
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
Don't you trust me,

230
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,440
or the project?

231
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,600
It's fine if you don't understand.

232
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
We understand, that's enough.

233
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
And my aunt's relocation money...

234
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,400
How much can it earn in the bank?

235
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Invest with us,

236
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,600
you'll earn big.

237
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Mentor.

238
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,040
Mentor.

239
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
What's wrong?

240
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,320
Nothing.

241
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
[Chen Jun Law Firm]

242
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,240
Thanks for the desserts.

243
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
- Thanks, Attorney Dai. - Thanks.

244
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,560
This one for you.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,800
Here.

246
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,680
This is my favourite.

247
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,600
Chocolate, your favourite.

248
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,200
Thanks.

249
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,360
Aunt Tang is back!

250
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,680
Attorney Tang!

251
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,520
Bring it to Aunt Tang.

252
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,720
Attorney Tang!

253
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,640
Attorney Tang, want some?

254
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
Take one.

255
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,640
Aunt Tang, Aunt Lin,

256
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,080
these are for you from my dad.

257
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,040
- Thanks. - Thanks.

258
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,640
Xiaoyun.

259
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Thank you, Tongtong.

260
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,640
Alright.

261
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,760
My wife told me

262
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
Attorney Tang got injured

263
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,360
for saving a child.

264
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
Truly remarkable.

265
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,320
Having a lawyer like you

266
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,160
is a treasure for Chen Jun.

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,840
This cake shop in Luohu

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
is very trendy now.

269
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,280
But I recall it's not near

270
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,520
your office, is it?

271
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
I had my assistant go get it.

272
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Attorney Tang has a sharp eye.

273
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,400
No wonder my wife

274
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,800
has been praising you lately.

275
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,040
Says you handled several

276
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,680
incredibly tough cases.

277
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
You're the true ace

278
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
of Chen Jun Law Firm.

279
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Hardly an ace.

280
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,480
Chen Jun's lawyers all have strengths.

281
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,200
I just got

282
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
a bit luckier.

283
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,720
But speaking of luck,

284
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
that's you, Mr. Qi.

285
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
To have our Chen Jun's

286
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,560
one and only goddess,

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,720
and Tongtong,

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,920
such a lovely daughter.

289
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,040
You must cherish them.

290
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
Peilin will always be

291
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,480
my one and only goddess.

292
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,280
That will never change.

293
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
This is the workplace.

294
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,920
Don't show off in front of everyone.

295
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,040
An announcement, everyone.

296
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
Director Kang has just

297
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,200
offered to pay out of pocket

298
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,840
for a weekend

299
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,520
beach getaway for everyone.

300
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you, Director Kang!

301
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,880
This team-building,

302
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,640
you can bring family along.

303
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,040
All expenses on Director Kang.

304
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,400
Thanks, Director Kang!

305
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,680
What's up? Can't make it?

306
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,440
I haven't decided yet.

307
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,960
Come relax with us.

308
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,520
Bring that boyfriend of yours.

309
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
- Come on. - Let's go.

310
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
Something wrong?

311
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,520
You seem distracted.

312
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,840
Did something happen?

313
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,360
Nothing.

314
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm just wondering...

315
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,160
Are all men

316
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,680
so good at lying?

317
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,880
Can't generalize like that.

318
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,720
Sometimes, lying might have

319
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,040
its own reasons.

320
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,760
So Director Kang,

321
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,400
you divorced your ex-wife...

322
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,640
What was the

323
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,240
unavoidable reason for lying?

324
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm lost. Wrong room.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,680
Come here.

326
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,560
Take a good look.

327
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,040
Isn't the view incredible?

328
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
This space...

329
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,240
So big!

330
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
Look.

331
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,880
This is my conference room.

332
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,000
You've already set it up?

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,040
Of course!

334
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,040
You can see for miles!

335
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Soon, I'll stand

336
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
at the top of this city.

337
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,359
This view belongs to us.

338
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,319
Your position

339
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,599
determines your vision.

340
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,839
With my new company,

341
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
I'll achieve great things!

342
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,480
Oh, right.

343
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,320
My parents

344
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
agreed to provide the money.

345
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
My aunt's money too.

346
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Great! A kiss.

347
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,200
Tomorrow,

348
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,520
I'll help them register.

349
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,320
Wait.

350
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,440
Don't be in such a hurry.

351
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,880
I haven't finished.

352
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,440
My parents said

353
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,160
they don't understand investing,

354
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,040
but they want to support you.

355
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
They've decided

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
to give you the money as a loan.

357
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,400
Set a repayment date and interest.

358
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,520
Any normal profits later

359
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,320
will be ours.

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
[Loan Agreement]

361
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
You want to sign an agreement with me?

362
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,680
You don't even trust me?

363
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
That's not it.

364
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,560
We're not married yet.

365
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,320
Clearer is better.

366
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,920
I'll sign it,

367
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,080
representing them.

368
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,960
It'll make them feel more secure.

369
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,280
Fine.

370
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,080
Good practice.

371
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Plenty of big contracts ahead.

372
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,080
My company has a weekend trip.

373
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,040
Family can come.

374
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,080
Want to go with me?

375
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,920
Of course I want to!

376
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
I have to go.

377
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,280
Support you, make you look good.

378
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,440
Let me take the suitcase.

379
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
- Careful. - Here, let me.

380
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
- Don't forget. - Thanks.

381
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,800
Director Kang, anything

382
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,480
I can help you carry?

383
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,640
I've got it. Everyone here?

384
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,280
Yes.

385
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
I thought Attorney Tang wasn't into

386
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,240
non-work-related events.

387
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,280
Surprised you're so keen.

388
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Director Kang paying out of pocket,

389
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,560
a rare chance like this,

390
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,640
how could I miss it?

391
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Director Kang, nice to see you.

392
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Enjoy yourselves.

393
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Peilin's here.

394
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,640
- Aunt Tang! - Tongtong!

395
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,480
Aunt Tang's hand is hurt.

396
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,960
Get down.

397
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,040
Don't let her hold you.

398
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,960
You're heavier.

399
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,120
Put her down.

400
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,240
Your hand is injured.

401
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
- Hello. - Senior.

402
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,400
Jiajia has a school thing,

403
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,880
so this time

404
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,120
I only brought Tongtong.

405
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
Where's Qi Wen? Not coming?

406
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,200
He's in Hong Kong.

407
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
A client just came over.

408
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,080
What client is more important?

409
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
Work matters...

410
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,280
We never interfere with each other.

411
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,480
Why the sudden

412
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,840
interest in him?

413
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,560
You two are usually inseparable.

414
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,480
Just not used to it.

415
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,760
Watch the car! Car!

416
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,160
Careful!

417
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,360
Nice ride, Xiaoyun!

418
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,600
Xiaoyun!

419
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Wow, Xiaoyun. Impressive!

420
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,520
Oh my.

421
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
This is your assistant?

422
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,120
Morning, everyone.

423
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
Xiaoyun talks about you all often.

424
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
Pleasure to meet you.

425
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,520
You're Lin Xiaoyun's boyfriend?

426
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,600
And you are?

427
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,520
Kang Jun.

428
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,240
Attorney Kang. I've heard of you.

429
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,120
Pleasure.

430
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Everyone ready?

431
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,480
- Ready. - Ready.

432
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,120
Let's go.

433
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,040
Let's go.

434
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,920
Have you heard of

435
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,200
Yunpeng Capital before?

436
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Yes, that's my project.

437
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe we'll have

438
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,960
a chance to work together.

439
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,640
Absolutely.

440
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,440
Let's exchange WeChat later.

441
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,960
Sure.

442
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,160
Mentor, Attorney Dai.

443
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,080
Go ahead and laugh.

444
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,520
That nouveau riche act.

445
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,440
I can't even.

446
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,560
He's young.

447
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,360
It's normal.

448
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,080
A convertible? Seriously?

449
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
Aren't he afraid of getting you tanned?

450
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,480
Go.

451
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,280
Let's go.

452
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,160
His car is rented.

453
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
I have no idea how much he spent.

454
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,240
The wind messed up my hair.

455
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,560
My makeup's about to get ruined.

456
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,080
Everyone, everyone!

457
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,040
Look who I invited!

458
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,760
Our Director Kang!

459
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,560
Attorney Kang!

460
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,600
Director Kang!

461
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,680
Brother Kang

462
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,440
Perfect timing, you're here.

463
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,880
Join us for a game!

464
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Five shots each.

465
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,400
The two with the highest scores

466
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,440
will face off. How about it?

467
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,360
Sure, no problem.

468
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,240
I'll be the referee!

469
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,600
Okay, okay.

470
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:42,960
Come on.

471
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,040
Start, start, start!

472
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,920
Come on, come on.

473
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,640
Brother Kang, sit here with me.

474
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,320
You guys go together.

475
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay.

476
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,400
Come on, come on.

477
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
Alright, get ready, get ready!

478
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,760
We're ready, ready!

479
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,360
When are we starting?

480
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,640
We're all ready!

481
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,040
Everyone, attention!

482
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,440
Three, two, one…

483
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,480
Start!

484
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,040
Good!

485
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,360
Everyone

486
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,760
I'll announce the results.

487
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,160
Attorney Zhao,  Attorney Zhang,  Attorney Li,

488
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,360
and Qian Peng are all eliminated.

489
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Advancing to the finals are

490
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,240
Brother Fang and Director Kang.

491
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,640
Director Kang,

492
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,160
How about whoever loses

493
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,440
has to be responsible for the barbecue?

494
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,280
Go for it!

495
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,440
Okay, let's do the final round.

496
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,760
Three shots to decide the winner.

497
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,040
Let's see who will be our shooting champion!

498
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,240
Get ready!

499
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,360
Three, two, one…

500
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,680
Start!

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,920
I declare

502
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,840
the winner is our Director Kang!

503
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
So cool!

504
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,920
Director Kang, you've been hiding your skills!

505
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,280
Just stayed focused.

506
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,040
Then we'll trouble Brother Fang

507
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,560
to barbecue for us tonight.

508
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,320
Alright!

509
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,640
Thanks everyone for this opportunity.

510
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
You're in for a treat!

511
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Great!

512
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,080
Let's taste Brother Fang's skills.

513
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,760
Let's try his cooking!

514
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,160
You're not playing?

515
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,280
Nope.

516
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,520
Tongtong is so amazing!

517
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,000
Awesome!

518
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,560
She's having so much fun.

519
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,280
How's the battle going inside?

520
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,080
The strange competitive drive among males.

521
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,680
Winning or losing really doesn't

522
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,440
matter much to me anymore.

523
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,000
I'd rather be here

524
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,440
and enjoy the leisure and peace.

525
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,280
Sis.

526
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
Do you think marriage is happy?

527
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,520
You're not thinking of marrying

528
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,920
Mr. Fang, are you?

529
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,560
No way. What are you talking about...

530
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,480
When it comes to marriage,

531
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,560
there's no right answer.

532
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,640
I believe everyone

533
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
within a marriage

534
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,240
will have a different experience.

535
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,080
Like with Qiwen and me,

536
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,760
we've found a way

537
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,720
that lets us

538
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
coexist very comfortably.

539
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,120
Understanding and trusting each other.

540
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,320
That's why our marriage

541
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,920
has lasted until now.

542
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,360
Have you ever doubted him?

543
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,880
You mean betrayal?

544
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,280
No.

545
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Although there are often

546
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,320
many women around him,

547
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,720
showing off their charm to him,

548
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,360
I've never worried.

549
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,880
Why?

550
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,080
From lovers to husband and wife,

551
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
it's been almost twenty years.

552
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,680
I know him well.

553
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,120
Qiwen is a decent man.

554
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
He wouldn't give up his decency

555
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
just to chase novelty

556
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,080
or excitement.

557
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,600
Tongtong, your dad is here.

558
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,600
Daddy!

559
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm here!

560
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,000
Brought this for you.

561
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,720
Honey, what brings you here?

562
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,320
I thought

563
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
you'd take much longer.

564
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,440
Weren't you meeting a client?

565
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,800
It went smoothly.

566
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,640
I saw the client off

567
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
and hurried over to be with you.

568
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,320
Really?

569
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,600
Yes.

570
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,360
Having fun?

571
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,200
Yeah!

572
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,440
What were you playing?

573
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Last night…

574
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,920
The Seer is dead.

575
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,080
Werewolves win.

576
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,920
You're the werewolf, right?

577
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,280
Good teamwork!

578
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,920
Well played!

579
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,600
No, you were the wolf.

580
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,480
Obviously...And you weren't?

581
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,760
No, dude,

582
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,080
the Seer confirmed I'm innocent!

583
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,840
You didn't save me?

584
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,000
He's your boyfriend, how could I save you?

585
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
What if he's protecting you on purpose?

586
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Oh my god.

587
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,280
Out-of-game info ruins everything.

588
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,120
Clearly Attorney Kang, that old fox

589
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,760
is the werewolf.

590
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
What are you thinking?

591
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
No, Brother Kang, you are the werewolf?

592
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,840
Yes, I am the werewolf.

593
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
Director Kang,

594
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,440
your ability to control the game

595
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,520
is truly impressive.

596
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,160
Not at all.

597
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,120
Especially at the start,

598
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,000
skipping the Seer was a masterstroke.

599
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,160
One bluff, and you revealed

600
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,280
Mr. Fang's identity.

601
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,200
I had no choice.

602
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,560
Mr. Fang was playing too well.

603
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,480
So sharp!

604
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
Checking me all night,

605
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,680
I had to strike first.

606
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,200
Director Kang.

607
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,720
Let's not play like that again, alright?

608
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Mr. Qi,  I never expected

609
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,880
you played the innocent villager too convincingly.

610
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,960
Your speech had no flaws.

611
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
I'm seriously impressed.

612
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,560
Attorney Tang, we won this round.

613
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
Just lucky, I guess.

614
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,880
Otherwise, if it had gone to the end

615
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,960
and my wife were still in the game,

616
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
I probably would've been exposed.

617
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,960
Why?

618
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Because in front of you

619
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,280
any lie of mine

620
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,960
would be seen through by you.

621
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,760
Daddy, you're wrong.

622
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,080
You lied to Mommy yesterday.

623
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
On Mommy's birthday,

624
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,040
you said you had a business trip abroad.

625
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,040
But that day

626
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,840
you never went on a trip.

627
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,440
Instead, you took Mommy and us

628
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,160
to see the drone show.

629
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,320
It was Peilin's birthday.

630
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,520
I specially booked

631
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,760
a drone performance

632
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,800
at Victoria Harbour

633
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,120
as a surprise for her.

634
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,960
Feeling a bit dizzy. I'll go get some water.

635
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,120
Want some?

636
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,520
Yes.

637
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,800
Here.

638
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,640
You peel it for me.

639
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,360
I'll go check.

640
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,280
Do you eat or not?

641
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,760
For you.

642
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,920
Got it.

643
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,960
Director Kang, what are you doing here?

644
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,080
They're all in pairs.

645
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,320
Why didn't you bring a plus-one?

646
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
You just noticed?

647
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,240
I noticed long ago.

648
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,360
That's why

649
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
I brought you along.

650
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,720
Fair enough.

651
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,360
Who's this?

652
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,600
Pretty, right?

653
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,360
Beautiful.

654
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,280
Your girlfriend?

655
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,160
Ex-wife.

656
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Why does this look

657
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,040
like it's abroad?

658
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,920
Tanzania.

659
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,800
Serengeti plains.

660
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,960
A national park.

661
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
This was the day

662
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,080
the two of us met.

663
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,320
We both

664
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,160
got into the same SUV, one after the other.

665
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,680
Maybe when I got in,

666
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,920
I made too much noise.

667
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,480
So she turned around

668
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
and glared at me fiercely.

669
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,360
I'll never forget that look.

670
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,320
Then, right there

671
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,760
at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro,

672
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,120
I proposed to her.

673
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,080
And then?

674
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,000
And then…

675
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,840
We kept walking…

676
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,080
…and drifted apart.

677
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,080
So what's your relationship now?

678
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,280
Not lovers anymore.

679
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
But still friends.

680
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,520
Do you have…

681
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,000
No.

682
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,800
No kids. Nothing.

683
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,480
Nothing at all, Director Kang.

684
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,480
I was on Kiribati,

685
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,520
the place on Earth

686
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,920
where you see the sunrise first.

687
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,640
I felt everything was new.

688
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm fine.

689
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,480
Hope you are too.

690
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,840
Thanks.

[Outpatient Building of Pingshan District Central Hospital, Shenzhen]

693
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,480
So, did you get it confirmed?

694
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,520
Are you happy for me?

695
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,520
The doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant.

696
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,720
Let me see.

697
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
Take a look. Here, look.

698
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,200
The doctor says I'm pregnant.

699
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,480
I really didn't expect this.

700
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,560
What's wrong?

701
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,000
Are you stunned with joy?

702
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,520
I honestly never thought...

703
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,960
Wait, what are you planning to do?

704
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
I'm going to do everything I can

705
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,360
to keep it.

everything looks fine right now.

708
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,120
I just hope

everything continues to go smoothly.

710
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,000
Given your current physical condition,

711
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,520
I suggest you

712
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,000
really think this through carefully.

713
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,760
After all, when you gave birth to Tongtong

714
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
you already walked through

715
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,280
the gates of hell once.

716
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,719
I'm worried about you.

717
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,320
This is an unexpected gift.

718
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,520
I don't want to turn it away.

719
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,800
What kind of gift is this?

720
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,040
Let's be honest. Aren't you just

721
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,679
trying to give the Qi family a son?

722
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
It's not like that.

769
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,320
Of course,

770
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,600
this might not mean anything.

771
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,000
[Huatian Hotel]

772
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,560
I never thought a scene from a movie

773
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,280
would play out in my own life.

774
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,160
Sometimes life

775
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,680
is stranger than fiction.

776
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,360
Calm down. Try to be an observer.

777
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,000
Sis, that day at the beach,

778
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,920
you told me

779
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,720
that marriage is something

780
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,080
that brings happiness.

781
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,280
Do you still think that now?

782
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,400
It depends on the person.

783
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
I was happy once too.

784
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,120
Maybe this is just the "fortress besieged".

785
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,080
Knowing full well it's full of uncertainties,

786
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,360
there are still so many people

787
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,320
who want to jump in.

788
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,680
Sis, don't move.

789
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,280
Don't turn around.

790
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
They're coming out. How many?

791
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,840
Just one.

792
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,680
What do we do now?

793
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,920
You stay here. I'll handle this.

794
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,360
Excuse me, may I ask...

795
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,800
Never mind. Thank you.

796
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,040
Hi.

797
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,760
Hello.

798
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Can I talk to you for a moment?

799
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,720
Do I know you?

800
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,200
No.

801
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,120
You know Qi Wen, right?

802
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm his wife.

803
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,720
Ma'am, here's your water.

804
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,520
I can't drink ice water right now.

805
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,480
Please bring me a glass of lukewarm water.

806
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,280
Thank you.

807
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,520
Of course. Just a moment, please.

[Tang Yingying]

809
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,200
May I ask how old you are?

810
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Twenty-one.

811
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
My name is Lisa.

812
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,920
Since you've come all the way here,

813
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,600
you probably already know who I am.

814
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,960
This has nothing to do with me.

815
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,480
Your husband sought me out.

816
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,920
Seems Qi Wen didn't lie to you that

817
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,840
he's single.

818
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,920
Mrs. Qi,

819
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
I think you might have the wrong idea.

820
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,280
Your husband isn't having an affair.

821
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
He hasn't betrayed you.

822
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,080
What do you mean?

823
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,240
This... is just a transaction.

824
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,480
He paid a sum of money

825
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,600
for me to bear him a son.

826
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,120
Between him and me,

827
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,800
it's purely business.

828
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Business.

829
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Your womb has a price tag.

830
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,080
That's my business.

831
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,560
It has nothing to do with you.

832
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,640
How long has this transaction

833
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,120
been going on between you?

834
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,200
Three months.

835
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,680
We don't meet

836
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,120
that often each month.

837
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,600
According to the agreement,

838
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,280
we meet on the days

839
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,400
when I'm fertile.

840
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,960
The term is one year,

841
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,480
until I get pregnant.

842
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,160
Mr. Qi pays me

843
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,280
a monthly fee.

844
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,280
On top of the fixed monthly payment,

845
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,440
if the tests show

846
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,520
it's a boy,

847
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,760
Mr. Qi will

848
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,400
pay me an additional one million.

849
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,160
Once the child is born, the contract ends.

850
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
That million will be paid in full.

851
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,000
And if it's a girl?

852
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
It gets terminated.

853
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,600
In that case,

854
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,200
Mr. Qi will still

855
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,480
pay me five hundred thousand.

856
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,640
A reasonable deal, don't you think?

857
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,280
And then?

858
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,680
I imagine he'll start looking

859
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,960
for another candidate.

860
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,960
With the terms he's offering,

861
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
there are plenty of people who'd want this job.

862
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,600
Are you people crazy

863
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,080
or is the whole world crazy?

864
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,000
Do you even hear what you're saying?

865
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,280
Ruining your own body,

866
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,880
casually giving up a life...

867
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,520
Are you even human?

868
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,480
Mrs. Qi, are you familiar with the law?

869
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,000
An unborn fetus

870
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,360
cannot yet be considered a life.

871
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,000
A fetus's interests

872
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,760
are protected by law only

873
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,400
under special circumstances.

874
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,400
To be honest,

875
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,080
Mr. Qi is a very good client.

876
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,920
He's taken good care of me throughout the process.

877
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,800
He's been very respectful of my feelings.

878
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,120
And most importantly, regarding the payment,

879
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
he's been very generous.

880
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,920
I'm satisfied.

881
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,160
For money,

882
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
you can just disregard everything?

883
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,280
Even if you give birth to a son,

884
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,880
have you thought

885
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,480
that you'll never see him again?

886
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,960
Doesn't that bother you at all?

887
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,120
Talking about this is pointless.

888
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Mrs. Qi,

889
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,560
I am not your enemy.

890
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,480
Nor do I want to ruin your marriage.

891
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,520
Once I give birth to the son,

892
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,560
I'll walk away from the deal.

893
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,680
I won't have any further

894
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,920
entanglement with Mr. Qi.

895
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,400
It's a mutually agreed-upon transaction.

896
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,920
I don't see anything wrong with it.

897
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,680
On the contrary,

898
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,680
I think Mr. Qi loves you very much.

899
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,760
He doesn't even want you

900
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,200
to suffer through childbirth.

901
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
He's a very good husband.
