00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,880
I'll go find the police.

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,560
No need, no need.

6
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,080
The child was taken by Yan Bin's fellow villager, He Na,

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,120
to Longxin Village.

8
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
But He Na's phone is off.

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,759
I don't know whether the child

10
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,920
is safe now.

Then the two of us

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,560
meet at the highway exit

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
and go directly to that village.

15
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,600
Okay, okay.

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Keep in touch.

Here, Yaozu, time for milk.

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,200
He's been fussing all night.

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,960
Don't talk.

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
Can't you see he's crying?

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,240
Keep your voice down.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
Come on, Yaozu, Yaozu.

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,640
we'd like to ask you about.

What's going on?

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
and now the police are here!

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,960

Oh,

36
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520

he does rescue work with a civil organization.

76

If he's a professional,

77
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,760

If we keep waiting like this,

131

it's not a solution.

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,320
If they're not found

133
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680

134
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,280
Um,

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,760

136
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
with the mountain paths here,

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,120

138
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,200
Yes, indeed.

139
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
Are there any old temples

140
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,520
or houses

141
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
or any shelters on that mountain?

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,680
No.

143
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,880
I already told the Chief.

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,320
It's just a mountain.

145
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,840

it was raining cats and dogs.

149
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
There was nowhere to hide.

150

There is a place...

151
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,160
The backside of the north mountain

152
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,840
with big rocks

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
is a good shelter.

154
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
Come on, take us there.

155
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,800
Wait a minute.

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,640
Wait a minute.

157
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,440
We can't just go up that mountain.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,640
The Chief just

159
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,840
made it very clear.

160
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,800
We need to follow orders.

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,800
We...

162
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,640
I know.

163
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
But the Chief just went up the mountain.

164
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,080
They won't be back for a while.

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,280
It's already getting dark.

166
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Can't you just follow orders for once?

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
I know what you're worried about.

168
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,360
Isn't there a local here?

169
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
He even has a walkie-talkie.

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
We can keep in touch as we go.

171
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,400
It'll be fine.

172
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,240
If you're scared,

173
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,960
you wait here.

174
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,600
I'll go with him.

175
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Come on, let's go.

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
Then... then what about the Chief?

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What, what should we do?

178
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,880
Let me tell you,

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,640
if anything happens to this child,

180
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,920
your wife will bear legal responsibility.

181
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
It's getting dark soon.

182
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,120
Do you think the two of them

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,080
might be in danger?

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay, okay.

185
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,800
You two wait.

186
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
I'll get you raincoats.

187
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,000
Slow down.

188
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,200
He Na!

189
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,640

190
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,840
He Na!

191
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Should be this way.

192
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,280

He Na did take this path.

293
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,400
We've already located

Listen to me.

298
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,640
He Na must have been

299
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,640
too tired to carry the child

300
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,680
and that's why she dropped the things here.

301
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,800
She must be nearby.

302
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,560
Let's search a bit more. Come on.

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,000
Wait.

304
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,640
Wait.

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,640
The child is important,

306
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,480
but our safety

307
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,160
is more important, okay?

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You are a lawyer.

309
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,680
Leave these things to the rescuers.

I am a lawyer.

311
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,560
But she's not far from here.

312
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,840
And that child is also

313
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,200
a very important client.

314
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm the leader, listen to me.

315
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,920
What are you doing?

316
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,880
Why does it have to be like this every time?

317
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,440
To achieve your goal,

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,600
you don't even care about your own life?

319
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,240
If you're scared,

320
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,160
you can leave now.

321
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,840
It's not the first time anyway

322

325
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
Now, abandon me.

326

I don't need you.

327
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,200
Slow down.

328
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,680
It's dangerous here.

329

and you're holding the child,

We came with the police.

354

Let me tell you,

355
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,160
Meiyuan has already regretted.

356
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,080
Ask your husband.

357
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,600
They are lawyers.

358
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,560
Good people.

359
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,400
They came up the mountain in the rain to look for you.

360
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,480
Quick, give them the child.

361
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,400
Give us the child.

362
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,160
Give it!

363
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,000
Help me hold this.

364
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,480
It's okay, it's okay.

365
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,200
It's okay, it's okay.

366
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,800
Alright.

367
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,960
We can't stay here now.

368
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,440
Let's go quickly.

369
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,240
You go ahead.

370
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,840
Okay, okay, okay.

371
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,200
Go.

372
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,000
Go.

373
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,480
Slow down.

374
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,360
We've already found the child.

375
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,680
We're coming down the mountain now.

376
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,400
Found him, finally.

377
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,080
Wait a minute.

378
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,720
We must take good care of the child.

379
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,920
And we must take good care of

380
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,840
our comrades as well.

381
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,160
And then, that...

382
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Let me do it.

383
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,400
Let me.

384
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,080
Let me help you.

385
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,560
No need, no need.

386
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,240
I can do it.

387
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,800
No,

388
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,600
it's fine.

389
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,480
I can.

390
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
Careful, careful, careful.

391
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,480
Everyone, watch your step.

392
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,480
Slow down.

393
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Landslide!

394
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,160
Danger!

395
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,520
Quick, get down!

396
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,360
Yaozu!

397
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,040
Where are you?

398
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
Yaozu!

399
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,360
Tang Yingying!

400
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,840
Over there!

401
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,960
Tang Yingying!

402
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,200
Tang Yingying!

403
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,920
Come and help!

404
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,760
Coming!

405
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,880
Kang Jun!

406
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,079
Kang Jun!

407
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Coming.

408
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,680
Yaozu!

409
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,680
Yaozu!

410
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Are you guys okay?

411
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,160
We're fine.

412
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,080
Yaozu!

413
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,520
Thank you.

414
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,920
Thank you

415
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,880
for saving Yaozu.

416
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,000
Tell her

417
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
I agree to all her conditions.

418
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,320
You're awake.

419
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

420
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,440
Don't move.

421
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,160
Had a nightmare?

422
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,960
Did you stay with me all night?

423
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,000
The doctor said

424
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
when on an IV drip,

425
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,280
someone must be with you.

426
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,800
You're lucky.

427
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,880
You don't have a fracture.

428
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,280
You just have a joint dislocation

429
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,800
and some soft tissue damage.

430
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,000
You need to rest.

431
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,800
How's the child? Is he okay?

432
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,760
Don't worry, he's fine.

433
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,840
Already checked.

434
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,840
He's been discharged already.

435
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,520
He Na has also confessed everything

436
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
to the police.

437
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,400
Meiyuan asked her to hide the child

438
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
away

439
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,440
and promised

440
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,480
that after getting the inheritance,

441
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
she'd give her 100,000 yuan.

442
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,800
After last night's events,

443
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,600
I feel like we

444
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
have also shared hardship.

445
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Then can you tell me,

446
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,240
why you risked your life to protect

447
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
that child?

448
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,680
Was it just for this case?

449
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,640
Maybe Meiyuan's child

450
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,000
reminded me of

451
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,240
myself when I was little.

452
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
When I was thirteen,

453
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,600
my dad got together with his female assistant.

454
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,400
My mom was emotionally distressed.

455
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,800
To make my dad come home,

456
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,640
she often tormented me,

457
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,640
made me get hurt.

458
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,520
After sobering up,

459
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,440
she would hug me and beg for my forgiveness.

460
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,920
One day she suddenly ran out.

461
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,000
She said she was going to find them.

462
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,960
It was also raining heavily that day.

463
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,840
[Mom!]

464
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,800
And then there was a car accident.

465
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,600
[Mom!]

466
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
[Mom!]

467
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,800
[Mom!]

468
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,200
I see.

469
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,240
So that day at the police station,

470
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,560
you lost control of your emotions

471
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,960
because you empathized deeply.

472
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,040
That's good, though.

473
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
You saved the child,

474
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
and also saved Meiyuan.

475
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
And it also helped you let go of

476
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
some of that childhood pain, right?

477
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,080
Right?

478
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,240
A good thing.

479
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,560
Maybe.

480
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,280
That day when you went to find Meiyuan,

481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,400
what did you say to her

482
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,240
that made her willing to tell you the truth?

483
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Didn't say much.

484
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,040
I just told her

485
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,400
that no mother

486
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
should let her own child

487
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,040
become part of a transaction.

488
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,640
Your hand was injured because of me, right?

489
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,200
Last night,

490
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,040
on the mountain,

491
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,640
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

492
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,760
I'm sorry.

493
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,880
Tang Yingying!

494
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
Tang Yingying!

495
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,880
Come and help!

496
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,040
Kang Jun!

497
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,400
Kang Jun!

498
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,480
Tang Yingying!

499
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,480
I admire your courage,

500
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
but I cannot agree with

501
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
your methods.

502
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,960
Do you know I care about you a lot?

503
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,920
Do you know

504
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,640
what would happen if there were an accident?

505
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,040
What are you talking about?

506
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,840
You scared me. How are you?

507
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,720
Are you badly hurt?

508
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,280
It's fine, just hit by a rock.

509
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,920
Just a flesh wound.

510
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,800
Not serious.

511
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
You scared me to death!

512
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,160
Oh, Director Kang.

513
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Hello.

514
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,960
Hello.

515
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
What happened last night

516
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,600
was indeed a landslide.

517
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Err. Dangerous.

518
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,640
[Truly dangerous.]

519
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
Thank you so much

520
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,680
for calling.

521
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,400
It's nothing, my duty.

522
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,880
Don't get your wound wet.

523
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm fine, really fine.

524
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
Does it still hurt?

525
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,040
Yes.

526
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,640
She... she...

527
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,720
Wait a minute.

528
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Your injured hand

529
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,880
can't bear weight.

530
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
Let me take care of you these days, okay?

531
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,680
Right, I... I... I

532
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,480
[I know an]

533
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,040
extremely skilled Chinese Medicine practitioner.

534
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,840
[I can take you to...]

535
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,680
In the early stage of bone injury,

536
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,040
Manual Therapy Rehabilitation isn't suitable.

537
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Rest should be the priority.

538
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,160
But he can do acupuncture.

539
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,000
Rest.

540
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Director Kang,

541
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,520
my boyfriend will take care of me.

542
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,240
OK.

543
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,560
Sorry for bothering.

544
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,200
I'll leave now.

545
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,520
Have a good rest.

546
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,760
Why were you so careless?

547
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,000
It hurts.

548
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,240
By the way,

549
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,120
while you were asleep,

550
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,680
Ms. Lan called.

551
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,400
Mr. Hu passed away last night.

552
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,560
Do you like this?

553
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm truly grateful to you

554
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,040
and Attorney Tang

555
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,040
for bringing Yaozu back safely.

556
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Especially Attorney Tang.

557
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
I hope to apologize

558
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,280
to her in person

559
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280
for my rudeness and prejudice before.

560
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,960
In our legal profession,

561
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,800
things like this

562
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,760
are quite common.

563
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,320
Attorney Tang is someone who

564
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,480
upholds professional principles.

565
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,520
As long as the matter

566
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,640
is properly resolved,

567
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,160
that's all

568
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,240
she needs.

569
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,400
I have to go to the police station.

570
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,000
Yaozu has a fever,

571
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,600
So， the police allowed me

572
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,040
to come back first to take care of him

573
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,840
before going to explain the details.

574
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,600
People must be responsible

575
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,120
for their actions.

576
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,560
I know.

577
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,000
I accept.

578
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,560
These punishments are what I deserve.

579
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,440
Everyone makes mistakes.

580
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,400
Although the outcome may not

581
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,760
meet your expectations,

582
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
at least you didn't lose him.

583
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,200
Please tell Lan

584
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,400
I accept her terms.

[In Loving Memory of Father Hu Cheng]

586
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,120
This is the revised agreement

587
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,680
from Attorney Tang.

588
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,040
If

589
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,560
there are no issues,

590
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,360
we can find a time

591
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,760
to sign it officially.

592
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
Then handle the equity transfer procedures.

593
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,120
Hu Yaozu's child support

594
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,080
will be transferred to your account

595
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,960
in full according to the agreement.

596
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,800
With that,

597
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,960
this matter will be settled.

598
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
Did Attorney Tang help me

599
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,080
negotiate the child support amount?

600
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,640
She asked me to tell you

601
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,360
she hopes your child

602
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
grows up healthy

603
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,320
and lives a carefree life.

604
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,160
Now we can

605
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,480
be honest with each other.

606
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,560
You arranged

607
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
all of this, didn't you?

608
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,360
It doesn't matter anymore.

609
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,000
Anyway,

610
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,160
we both got

611
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,000
what we wanted,

612
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,280
didn't we?

613
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,280
Now I think

614
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
we're both quite ridiculous.

615
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,600
Fighting back and forth

616
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,040
just for money.

617
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,040
"People die for wealth, birds for food"

618
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,760
it's just natural.

619
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,600
Thank you for your money

620
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,640
and Attorney Tang's blessings.

621
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
[You're still]

622
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,080
the same as when you were a child--

623
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,040
preferring the sunshine.

624
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,760
Like a plant,

625
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,680
cannot grow without sunlight.

626
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
I always feel like I can't see people's true hearts clearly.

627
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,360
I thought standing in the sun

628
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,800
would let me see more clearly.

629
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,160
I remember

630
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,080
you told me

631
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,440
that no matter what happens,

632
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,160
I'll always be your closest sister.

633
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,280
Do you still remember?

634
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
We've known each other for so long

635
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
that I can barely remember

636
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,400
what you used to be like.

637
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,640
I'm getting old.

638
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,000
Now,

639
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,080
no matter how much hair dye I use,

640
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,440
I can't cover my white hair.

641
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
No amount of medical aesthetics

642
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,160
can smooth the wrinkles on my face.

643
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,600
There are many things I can't do anymore.

644
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
The more powerless I feel,

645
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,480
the more I want to hold onto something.

646
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,440
Can you

647
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
understand that feeling?

648
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,120
My mom once said something

649
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
similar to you.

650
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,320
I remember when your mom

651
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,760
passed away,

652
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,280
it was the most

653
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
confused and painful

654
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,160
I'd ever seen you.

655
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,600
That's when I realized

656
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,040
how devastating

657
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,720
a broken family can be

658
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,880
for a child.

659
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,280
I didn't want to become like her,

660
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,120
and I didn't want Nicole

661
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,240
to lose her mom.

662
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,120
So， I chose to

663
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,160
divorce Hu

664
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,600
to maintain everyone's dignity.

665
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,000
What about that child?

666
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,040
If something

667
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,760
terrible had happened to him,

668
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
would your conscience have bothered you?

669
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,640
To be honest, I don't know.

670
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,200
After all,

671
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
nothing bad happened to him, right?

672
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,240
Thank you for being honest with me.

673
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
But evil spreads —

674
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,240
it passes down

675
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,800
layer by layer to those weaker than us.

676
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,200
The malice you had towards Meiyuan

677
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,560
was something she couldn't bear.

678
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,360
So， she had to take it out on someone

679
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,120
even weaker.

680
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,600
Within her capabilities,

681
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,400
the only one who could get hurt

682
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
was that child.

683
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
To be honest,

684
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I never intended

685
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
to hide anything from you.

686
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,640
But your world

687
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,480
is too black and white.

688
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,080
Some things

689
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,600
were never meant to see the light of day.

690
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,280
You don't need to know everything.

691
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,040
People's hearts can't withstand scrutiny —

692
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,800
no one's can.

693
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,400
You schemed against Meiyuan,

694
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,280
you schemed against your ex-husband.

695
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,760
Legally speaking,

696
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,800
your actions

697
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
aren't illegal.

698
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,400
But social order

699
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,600
can't rely solely on laws.

700
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,880
Everyone has their bottom lines,

701
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,280
and morality should too.

702
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,920
It's different.

703
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,240
Rare occasion.

704
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,560
These years,

705
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,120
Attorney Tang gave me

706
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,280
a legal lesson.

707
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,880
Anyway,

708
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,200
I'm still grateful

709
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,640
that you acted as my lawyer

710
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,400
and protected me

711
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,400
from breaking the law.

712
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,560
Just like

713
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,200
how I protected you when you were a child.

714
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,520
But this time,

715
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,960
I lost another

716
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,560
person closest to me.

717
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,880
The price is too high.

718
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,360
I'm sorry.

719
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,280
I really had no choice.

720
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,240
It doesn't matter anymore.

721
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,520
Congratulations.

Ms. Lan,

724
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,840
as your lawyer,

725
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,400
regarding Meiyuan's renunciation

726
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,680
of inheritance rights,

727
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,600
I have one last suggestion

728
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,640
If you're going to give it,

729
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
make it an auspicious amount.

730
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
Consider it

731
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,880
giving that child

732
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,040
a better,

733
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,280
regret-free life.

734
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,360
I just realized you're not

735
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,840
as money-driven as I thought.

736
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,840

738
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
as tough as he seems.

739
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,480
Why is it that when you compliment someone,

740
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,440
it always feels like

741
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,639
you're hiding a knife behind a smile?

742
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,679
Likewise.

743
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,760
Alright, I take back what I said earlier.

744
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,360
I still don't agree

745
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,480

that's very admirable.

749
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,480
I appreciate that.

750
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,679
Principles have never

751
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,560
been an issue

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,800
have been sent to

771
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,880
your email inboxes.

772
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,400
Please review them carefully.

773
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,440
I believe they will provide

774
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,880
a clearer direction for your work

775
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,600
and business development

776
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,080
in the future.

777
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,640
With the passing of Mr. Hu from Lanhu Group,

778
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,640
there have been changes

779
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,080
to the group's internal personnel arrangements.

780
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
Thanks to Attorney Tang

781
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,160
and Director Kang's

782
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,800
[outstanding work]

783
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
[on Mr. Hu's inheritance entrusted case,]

784
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
[the group's new chairman]

785
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,200
[has confirmed that]

786
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,600
all legal matters

787
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,360
will be entrusted to our Chen Jun Law Firm.

788
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,200
Your cooperation this time

789
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,960
has brought better development to the firm.

790
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,800
It seems

791
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,280
win-win cooperation

792
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,560
is the general trend.

793
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,280
Attorney Tang,

794
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,800
[what do you think?]

795
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,360
I've been the legal consultant

796
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,960
for Lanhu Group

797
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,080
for many years.

798
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,200
[So, many of their]

799
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,240
[previous legal issues]

800
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,480
[were sended to me.]

801
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,000
But this time,

802
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,880
I'm truly grateful

803
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,800
for Director Kang's full support.

804
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
As for future cooperation

805
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,280
with Lanhu Group,

806
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
I personally suggest

807
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,320
entrusting it to

808
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,840
younger lawyers at the firm.

809
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,640
They'd be more suitable.

810
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,040
What do you think,

811
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,640
Director Kang?

812
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
Attorney Tang's generosity and bearing

813
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,240
are worthy of learning

814
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,080
by all of us here.

815
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Let me be the first to applaud.

816
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,280
And,

817
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,640
during this trip to Guangzhou,

818
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,280
I witnessed Attorney Tang's

819
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,440
professionalism

820
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,200
as a lawyer.

821
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,400
I deeply admire it.

822
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,160
[I also saw]

823
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,960
[her]

824
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,840
[courageous]

825
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,480
[and selfless.]

826
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,360
But I want to tell everyone:

827
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,480
as a lawyer,

828
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,960
I don't recommend

829
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,160
putting yourselves in danger.

830
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
[No matter what problem you face,]

831
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,840
[tell me first.]

832
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,600
You have my support,

833
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,360
and Chen Jun Law Firm has your back.

834
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,080
We can help you resolve

835
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,040
all your problems.

836
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,680
Did everyone understand?

837
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,120
Yes!

838
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,040
Now let me introduce

839
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,960
a new colleague.

840
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,280
He'll be my assistant from now on.

841
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,400
Please stand up.

842
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,080
Introduce yourself.

843
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,160
Hello everyone,

844
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,640
my name is Cheng Feng.

845
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,600
I'm from Sichuan

846
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,880
and graduated from the Law Department of Agricultural University.

847
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,280
[I was very excited]

848
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,360
[listening to Director Kang's speech.]

849
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,080
[I feel honored]

850
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,240
to work at Chen Jun Law Firm.

851
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,160
And I hope

852
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,080
we can work with each other happily.

853
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,840
Thank you.

854
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,520
Oh!

855
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,200
I brought

856
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,400
some specialties from Sichuan

857
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,480
for everyone.

858
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,600
[I hope you like them!]

859
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,680
This tomato flavor is perfect

860
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,600
for hot pot.

861
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,400
This is spicy oil base!

862
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,000
[Please don't mind.]

863
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,080
[It's really delicious.]

864
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,440
This is clear broth base.

865
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
[If you need more,]

866
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,280
[just call me]

867
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,480
[and I'll send more!]

868
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,600
[The spicy oil one is amazing,]

869
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,640
[And so the spicy one.]

870
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,480
[Here, here.]

871
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,120
[there's pickled fish flavor too, and more!]

872
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,160
OK.

873
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
I never thought you two

874
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,480
used to be at odds with each other

875
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,400
and now you get along so well.

876
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,920
Just a trip to Guangzhou

877
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,960
made you reconcile.

878
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,000
You mean Kang Jun?

879
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me tell you,

880
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,440
not "so well".

881
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,680
Anyway, we were never enemies

882
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,040
we just fought together

883
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,160
to save a child

884
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,800
without considering our lives.

885
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,320
And then got a little

886
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,680
closer to each other.

887
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,640
Got a little closer to each other?

888
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,240
I think it's more than

889
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,640
"a little".

890
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,960
What are you thinking?

891
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,440
Even if we've developed a little

892
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,840
tacit understanding

893
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
and mutual appreciation,

894
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,520
so what?

895
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,680
We're all adults.

896
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
What does that prove?

897
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,320
You're so brave

898
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,760
to speak about your boss like that.

899
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,640
Absolutely Attorney Tang.

900
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,800
Hush.

901
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
You two just keep appreciating each other

902
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,400
and having tacit understanding.

903
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,600
Let everything else take its course.

904
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,400
Ma'am.

905
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,240
how are you feeling?

906
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,200
If you need anything,

907
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,920
just let me know.

908
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm fine — it's just a

909
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,360
minor dislocation.

910
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,200
Just need some rest.

911
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,360
You got injured jumping off a bridge a few months ago,

912
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,600
and now you're injured again.

913
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,440
Being a lawyer has become a high-risk profession.

914
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,520
You need to be more careful.

915
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
Your taste in clothes has improved.

916
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,960
Qian Peng's project is going well.

917
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,360
After securing investment,

918
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,800
it's started for a while.

919
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,680
Last week, there were nearly

920
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,400
a thousand new registrations in one day.

921
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,080
Qian Peng has also collaborated

922
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,040
with several financial experts

923
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,720
to provide consulting services to users.

924
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,600
The earliest users

925
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,760
of Yunpeng Capital

926
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,520
have already earned high returns.

927
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,040
Attorney Dai, ma'am.

928
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,960
you should really check it out.

929
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,240
The profits are really high.

930
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
I've invested all my savings

931
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,880
in Yunpeng Capital.

932
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,200
The annual return rate

933
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,760
is truly impressive!

934
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
Glad you're making money.

935
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,720
Congratulations.

936
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,960
Xiaoyun,

937
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,760
any investments carry risks —

938
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
especially projects with excessively high returns.

939
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,600
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

940
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,200
I think you should

941
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,400
pay attention to risk control.

942
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,240
I know, ma'am.

943
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,520
Times are different

944
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
from before.

945
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,320
There's no free lunch,

946
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,800
but there are opportunities.

947
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
Opportunities are for

948
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,040
the courageous.

949
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
I trust Yunpeng Capital.

950
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,000
OK.

951
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,000
How much longer do I have to

952
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
wear this thing?

953
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,360
Uncomfortable and ugly.

954
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,600
Three weeks to be safe.

955
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,360
If it's inconvenient for you,

956
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,320
let your assistant help you

957
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,240
at the law firm.

958
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,280
I'll help you after work.

959
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,240
I feel like such a useless person.

960
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
And you don't have to come over so often—

961
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,000
the firm has drivers.

962
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
It's such a hassle going back and forth.

963
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,800
I don't mind the hassle.

964
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,120
Do you

965
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,360
value your

966
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,600
personal space a lot?

967
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,600
What do you mean?

968
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,960
What I mean is,

969
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,360
I'm not too busy with work

970
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
lately,

971
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,640
so,

972
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,320
if you don't mind,

973
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,840
why not move in with me

974
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,960
for a while?

975
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,040
I can take care of you.

976
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,600
Are you just trying to take care of me,

977
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,240
or do you have other motives?

978
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,800
Of course, take care of you.

979
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,800
What are you thinking?

980
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,640
Your hand is injured.

981
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,400
Never mind then.

982
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,360
I really value my

983
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,960
personal space.

984
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,520
But...

985
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,080
Can you cook?

986
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,160
Absolutely!

987
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,280
I'll have you know my cooking skills

988
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,400
are highly praised.

989
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,240
By your ex-girlfriends?

990
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,720
Auh.

991
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,560
Do you mind?

992
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,640
Routine question.

993
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Don't take it too seriously.

994
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,320
As a single man,

995
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,520
your place is surprisingly

996
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,840
neat and tidy.

997
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
You knew I was coming?

998
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,760
I usually live in the dorm

999
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,800
near the company,

1000
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
and rarely come back here.

1001
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Every time I do,

1002
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,000
I feel like something's missing.

1003
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,040
What's missing,

1004
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,200
a hostess?

1005
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,720
I think it's already covered.

1006
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,640
Let me help you with that.

1007
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,400
You're hurt

1008
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,760
that you shouldn't be doing any work.

1009
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,840
Take a break.

1010
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,400
Where's the scissors?

1011
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,240
I want to put these flowers in water

1012
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,840
they're wilting.

1013
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,040
Sure.

1014
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,600
The scissors should be in

1015
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,000
the drawer over there.

1016
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,840
Hard for find them.

1017
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,400
Did you find them?

1018
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,880
Yes, I did.
