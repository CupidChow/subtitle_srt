3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,759
There's an event tomorrow afternoon

4
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,680
at the Startup park.

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,479
A Legal Risk Management Sharing Session.

6
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,840
Director Kang wants you to go.

7
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,120
I scheduled a client for you

8
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
for a divorce case at 2 PM,

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,880
meeting near the Startup Park.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,479
Mr. Xin's divorce case

11
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,920
court date is set.

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,479
The documents you asked me to prepare

13
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,720
I've sent to your email.

14
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,039
Divorced the same person three times,

15
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm speechless.

16
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
He doesn't tire, but I do.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
Reject a fourth time for me.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,280
The fee's not worth it.

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
By their age,

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,720
I probably won't have the courage

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,880
to divorce again.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,720
What does age have to do with it.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,280
Divorce at any age

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,079
is a free choice.

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,480
Ma'am,

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
I really admire you.

27
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,760
How do you manage to

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,240
handle work with clear logic

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,200
and deal with work well,

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
and still have the energy

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
to enjoy life?

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
It's like

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,520
you never make mistakes.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
How can anyone

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,280
never make mistakes.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,240
Making mistakes isn't key.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,480
What's important is having

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,040
the courage to correct them.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
Ma'am, I'll take this call.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Hello, ma'am.

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,480
I'll get the essential oil.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,320
Okay.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,240
What,

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm still at work.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
I'll probably work overtime too.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll cook for everyone tonight

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the sauerkraut fish.

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
Buy a big fish,

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
add more Sichuan peppercorns.

50
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,079
The numbing spice is good.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,720
We don't have

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,520
a bowl big enough

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
for the sauerkraut fish.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
Just afternoon tea

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
cost four hundred.

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
Order takeout again tonight,

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,560
spend over a thousand just on food a day.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
Think of something.

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,360
Okay, I got it.

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,160
Boyfriend?

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Ma'am,

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,640
can I leave early today?

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Sure.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,680
The post-trial agency opinion,

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,840
give it to me tomorrow morning.

66
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,640
Okay.

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,200
Xiaoyun,

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,640
a word of advice.

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Supporting his startup is fine,

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,600
but you have your own work.

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,760
Don't over-invest

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,680
and lose yourself.

73
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,960
Got it.

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
Thanks, Ma'am.

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,720
Boss, a fish for me.

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Is this one okay?

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,720
Okay.

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
Is it ready?

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Qian Peng.

80
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,400
Here, the fish is here.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,280
Coming.

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
Sis-in-law's here! Sis-in-law!

83
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
I got it, I got it.

84
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,040
Here, here, here.

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,520
Make room, make room.

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
You've worked hard, sis.

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
You've worked hard, sis.

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Come on, come on.

89
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
Why is it cold?

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
Maybe it's just too far away.

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,000
The wind cooled it off.

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,680
Is it cold, Mr. Qian?

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,160
It's not hot or cold, just right.

94
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,440
Thanks for your hard work, sis.

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Here's freshly steamed rice.

96
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
Everyone's starving.

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
Let's eat, Mr. Qian.

98
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
Eat, eat.

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Come on, come on.

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,600
Pass us some chopsticks.

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
Sit, sis, sit down.

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
Eat, eat, eat.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,760
Quick, serve the rice.

104
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,600
Sis, sit, sis, sit.

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
Sit down.

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Here, cover it.

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Thanks.

108
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,320
Where to cover it!

109
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Do it yourself.

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,040
Here, together.

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm fine.

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,360
By the way,

113
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
I brewed this wine for you.

114
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
You'll probably like it.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,920
Lychee flavor.

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,800
Try it.

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't drink too much.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
It's not high in alcohol,

119
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,120
but too much will still hit you.

120
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,760
With my tolerance, it's hard.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Fang Wei'an.

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
You like me, right?

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,760
Yes.

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,240
Me too.

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,760
You can kiss me now.

126
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,240
Xiaoyun, clean up first.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
It's almost eleven.

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,960
You go home first.

129
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,280
When you leave later,

130
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,240
take this with you.

131
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,360
I have no dish soap here.

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
Did you ever ask me

133
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,560
if I had dinner?

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
I also worked all day.

135
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,200
Do you know

136
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,960
how long it takes to carry

137
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,840
a nine-pound fish from the market?

138
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Do you know

139
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,240
how hard it was

140
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
to borrow this stainless bowl

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,360
from the restaurant?

142
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
The whole way, everyone...

143
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,360
Quiet, quiet.

144
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,320
You worked hard. My fault.

145
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,840
I'll transfer you

146
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
twenty thousand later.

147
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
You pay the next quarter's rent.

148
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
You'll have some left over.

149
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,280
Keep it for yourself.

150
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm go back first.

151
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,360
Don't overwork yourself either.

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,560
Do you want to go back and shower?

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,200
Your clothes smell.

154
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,520
That room is also too...

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,920
Well, so what if it smells.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Tomorrow is the first product

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
pitch meeting.

158
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,760
I'll go back after we're done.

159
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,400
You worked hard.

160
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
Don't skip dinner.

161
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
It's bad for your stomach.

162
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't be angry.

163
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
Slowly.

164
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I'll pick you up after work.

165
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
No need. The company has a driver.

166
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,840
Tomorrow then?

167
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Fang Wei'an,

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
we don't have to do this.

169
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,360
Skip the flowers, gifts,

170
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
candlelit dinners,

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,400
the usual routines.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
They don't suit me.

173
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
I'll call you when I'm free, okay?

174
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,240
Why do I suddenly feel

175
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,920
like such a simp?

176
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,080
Fine. I respect your way.

177
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,160
Wait for my call.

178
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,440
Ma'am,

179
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,040
here are my summaries

180
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
of a few case closures.

181
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,320
Okay, put them there.

182
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,120
I'll check later.

183
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,040
Ma'am, you look

184
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,320
radiant today.

185
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Maybe it's because

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,280
I changed my lipstick shade.

187
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,840
Director Kang,

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,640
are you free?

189
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,960
Sure.

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,280
Ma'am, I'll step out.

191
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,120
Sit.

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,000
What can I do for you?

193
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,520
In a couple of days in Guangzhou,

194
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,160
there's a lawyers' forum.

195
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,160
I hope Attorney Tang can

196
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,040
spare a little time

197
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,880
to represent our firm.

[Invitation]

199
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
These forums

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,840
are better for you and Peilin.

201
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640

Peilin hopes

205
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,200
you can go.

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,080
I think Chen Jun Law Firm

209
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
already has two star lawyers,

210
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
you and Peilin. That's enough.

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
I've never given up

212
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,240
on inviting you to be

a senior partner here.

214
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
Director Kang's high regard

215
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,240
is really pressure-inducing.

216
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,520
By the way,

217
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
I heard before

218
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,560
you applied for

221
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Then I came.

222
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,120
Yes, correct.

223
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
That room has the best

224
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,960

225
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
It really does.

I stole your spot. My fault?

227
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,520
Just repurposing waste.

228
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,440

I just said it offhand.

376
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Director Kang takes it too seriously.

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,120
to cooperate with you on.

388
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,120
Okay, I'll be direct then.

389
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,800
You are one of

390
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
Chen Jun Law Firm's finest lawyers.

391
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,560
One of?

392
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
One of.

393
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,400
You saw the old-school lawyers'

394
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
hesitant and wait-and-see attitude.

395
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,800
So I need your support.

396
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Need you to set an example.

397
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,920
Those young people

398
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
need your guidance more.

399
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
Peilin supports you so much.

400
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,320
Don't be too greedy.

401
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
I need you to understand now

402
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,280
why I'm doing this,

403
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
my purpose.

404
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,880
It's not for myself.

405
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,360
You are warriors

406
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,880
fighting outside.

407
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm the one guarding home.

408
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm the manager. Home can't be chaotic.

409
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
So my duty is to ensure

410
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,760
the whole firm coexists harmoniously,

411
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,040
progresses together.

412
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,240
I want those young people

413
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,680
to grow quickly,

414
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,120
boost their capabilities,

415
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,680
increase their loyalty

416
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,320
and sense of belonging.

417
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,680
Ideally,

418
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,080
then

419
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,040
ultimately we can achieve

420
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,760
mutual support and win-win cooperation.

421
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,600
Director Kang,

422
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,400
You're really good at making empty promises.

423
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,320
No, I mean your

424
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,400
choice of words.

425
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm starting to doubt

426
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
your overseas study background.

427
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,080
Attorney Tang,

428
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,760
you're smart.

429
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,440
You should know

430
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm sincere.

431
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,080
Still the same question.

432
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,040
So many lawyers in the firm.

433
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,920
Why must you corporate with me?

434
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Because you are one of

435
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,040
the firm's best lawyers.

436
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,080
"One of," I know.

437
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,200
Thanks for the reminder.

438
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,280
And what I'm more certain of is

439
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,400
if Chen Jun Law Firm wants

440
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,000
to reach the next level, it must

441
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,240
leverage your ability and experience.

442
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
By then, I also hope

443
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,280
Peilin, over here.

444
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,200
I can work with you.

445
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Ordered for you.

446
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,880
Sorry,

447
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,640
I had plans with Peilin earlier.

448
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,720
Forgot to tell you.

449
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,520
By the way,

450
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,320
where was Director Kang?

451
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,840
Something about defending home and country.

452
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,400
And... what else?

453
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,120
Sitting here today,

454
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,560
let's not hide anything.

455
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,920
Attorney Tang at Chen Jun Law Firm

456
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,480
has always done their own thing.

457
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
Even when Director Chen

458
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,520
was here,

459
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,920
she didn't even show any deference.

460
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,880
So if you feel

461
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,040
offended,

462
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
you should be glad

463
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,520
Tang considers you one of her own.

464
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,000
Really?

465
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
See, Director Kang

466
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,240
is now so slick and worldly.

467
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,680
Even if

468
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
has a hundred grievances,

469
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,920
surface shows a smiling face.

470
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
I really miss

471
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,040
the days facing off in court

472
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,360
against Director Kang.

473
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,040
At least

474
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,840
that was the real Director Kang.

475
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,400
I think Director Kang also wants

476
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,120
your trust and recognition.

477
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,080
Director Kang, since you've

478
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
asked Attorney Tang out alone,

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,920
I believe she wants to hear

480
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,560
your true thought.

481
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,760
Actually, it's simple.

482
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,040
If you join

483
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
this project

484
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,880
and tell Dai,

485
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,680
as the director,

486
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,720
I'll live up to you.

487
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,200
Are you making a deal?

488
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,960
I call it cooperation.

489
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,120
Even though

490
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,760
I've been away for two years,

491
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,600
I've built up

492
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,240
plenty of resources and connections

493
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
from my past career.

494
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,800
If you need them,

495
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
just tell me.

496
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,120
No strings attached.

497
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
One more thing.

498
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I've never given up on

499
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,080
inviting you to be

500
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,040
a partner at Chen Jun Law Firm.

501
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,600
Besides, the project

502
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
will also bring you

503
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,240
more prestige at the Firm.

504
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,720
Trust me.

505
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,800
It's a waste for you

506
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,040
to be a lawyer.

507
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,680
You should be in business

508
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,000
and would be unbeatable.

509
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,240
I think his proposal

510
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,320
is worth considering.

511
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,840
Now that

512
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,200
we're all here today,

513
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,720
I'll speak my mind.

514
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,360
I know you have your doubts,

515
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,680
but as a lawyer,

516
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,080
you can't be without a law firm.

517
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,360
And you can't do all things

518
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
all by yourself forever.

519
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
You trust me,

520
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,640
and I trust Kang Jun just as much.

521
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,720
I think we three can

522
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,360
work together wholeheartedly.

523
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,480
If the Firm sails steady,

524
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
all of us will be better.

525
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Alright.

526
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,120
I trust Dai,

527
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,280
so I can trust you, too.

528
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Then let's give it a try.

529
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,960
I'll do my utmost to cooperate.

530
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,840
Thank you.

531
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
Time to eat.

532
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,440
It's rare to get out with you two.

533
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,440
Let me treat you both

534
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,320
to some...

535
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,240
Such a busy schedule!

536
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,120
Let me introduce you.

537
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
My boyfriend, Fang Wei'an.

538
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,320
Mr. Kang.

539
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,280
Hello.

540
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,240
Hello.

541
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,520
My senior colleague, Ms. Dai.

542
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,280
Hi.

543
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
I'll take off then.

544
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Bye.

545
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,240
Get some what?

546
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,640
Hot pot.

547
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,560
Okay.

548
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,920
She's truly outstanding,

549
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,120
whether as a lawyer

550
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,800
or as a woman.

551
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,640
Yeah.

552
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,480
H24

553
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,080
Eau de Toilette.

554
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,680
Your little agenda,

555
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,160
it's written all over the air.

556
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
Dai,

557
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,840
I know she called you here

558
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,960
all of a sudden

559
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,880
definitely to ask you

560
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
to turn down my offer for her.

561
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,520
I never thought

562
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
you'd help me out.

563
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Thank you so much

564
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,040
for defusing her hostility to me.

565
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,240
I can help you with this,

566
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,880
but there's something no one can help.

567
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,840
I have another appointment, bye.

568
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,240
Bye.

569
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,440
It's almost seven.

570
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,080
No word from Mr. Yu?

571
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
You don't know

572
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,520
that venture capital summit.

573
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,600
Startup after startup,

574
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,600
each only gets a few minutes

575
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
for their speech.

576
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,240
The investors there

577
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,120
have seen a lot.

578
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,760
They're swamped with projects.

579
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,120
I wined and dined them hard,

580
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,800
opening several bottles of imported wine,

581
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,720
partied with them all night.

582
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
And yet,

583
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,080
got nothing out of it.

584
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
Venture capitalists are all sharp cookies.

585
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,800
Just wining and dining don't work.

586
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Didn't you always say

587
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,560
there's a

588
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,000
wealthy female lawyer?

589
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,080
The one who married a rich guy.

590
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,720
You said she's well-connected

591
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,760
in the finance community.

592
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,680
If she could help you...

593
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,920
She's my boss.

594
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,400
If she's not on board,

595
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
how can I turn to her again?

596
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,880
What does she even know?

597
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
It's not even seven yet.

598
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Wait a bit longer.

599
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,880
Work your tail off.

600
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,160
Have more meat.

601
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,320
You're in a good mood today.

602
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,160
Is it because of

603
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,480
what I said when I introduced you?

604
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,160
I actually always thought

605
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,880
you weren't ready to go public with it.

606
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,560
Just boyfriend.

607
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,560
It doesn't mean anything.

608
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
That Director Kang,

609
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,000
is he a lawyer, too?

610
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,280
A parachute director,

611
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
my immediate superior,

612
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,160
and a rival

613
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
a long-standing grudge.

614
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,000
It's great news.

615
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,600
Worth a celebration.

616
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,200
This smells really tempting.

617
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,240
No wonder you've been

618
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,840
dying for this for days.

619
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,320
Watch out for acne.

620
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,120
I don't care.

621
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
Let's sit here.

622
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,760
- Okay.
- Fine.

623
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,480
Let's go over

624
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,280
and say hi.

625
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,800
I'll pass.

626
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,120
You go.

627
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,400
What's wrong?

628
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,920
Eat. Nothing.

629
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Ying,

630
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
I didn't expect to see you here.

631
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,280
Mr. Jiang,

632
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,320
small world, isn't it?

633
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,560
Since we met,

634
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
let's have dinner together.

635
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,760
No thanks.

636
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,320
We're just finishing up.

637
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,800
We should get going.

638
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,320
Bye.

639
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,960
Who's he?

640
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,000
Does it matter?

641
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,840
Bye, Mr. Jiang.

642
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,240
Excuse me.

643
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720
Aren't you curious?

644
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,360
Everything about you

645
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,520
interests me.

646
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,640
If you're willing to tell me,

647
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,200
there's no need to ask.

648
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,000
He's Jiang Huaishan,

649
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,960
my father.

650
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,800
From my name,

651
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,880
you should know

652
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
I took my mom's surname.

653
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
The relation between us

654
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,640
is practically non-existent.

655
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,800
I understand.

656
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,240
You won't.

657
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
When kids who're starved for love

658
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
grow up,

659
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
they usually crave to lean on someone,

660
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,080
feel a total lack of security.

661
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,600
and have a strong need for affection

662
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,120
and a fierce possessiveness.

663
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,360
I know it's not right,

664
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
but sometimes

665
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,680
I just can't help it.

666
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,920
With me,

667
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,880
no need to hold back.

668
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,760
I want you to lean on me.

669
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,320
And I'll do everything I can

670
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,560
to give you a sense of security.

671
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,200
[People are just contradictory sometimes.]

672
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,760
[Desperately craving to be loved,]

673
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,640
[longing for that]

674
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,560
[unshakable sense of security.]

675
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,920
[Yet dreading that very love to the core,]

676
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,000
[afraid it's like slipping sand,]

677
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,280
[afraid it's a firework fading in an instant.]

678
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,320
[Afraid that after rushing in with all your joy,]

679
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
[it ends up with nothing at all.]

680
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,640
- Stop hounding me.
- Stay.

681
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,880
I've had enough.

682
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,560
Don't leave me.

683
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,720
- Get away!
- Stay!

684
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,560
Mom!

685
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,880
[Just like when I was thirteen.]

686
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,800
[One moment,]

687
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,480
[Mom held me and wept,]

688
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,840
[whispering she loved me gently.]

689
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,960
[But the next, she could steel her heart]

690
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,920
[and push me into the shards of glass.]

691
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,720
[When Dad said he'd love me forever,]

692
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,360
[the scent of another woman's perfume]

693
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,800
[still lingered on his suit shoulder.]

694
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,960
[The cloying sweetness hadn't faded yet,]

695
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,680
[but that promise]

696
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,760
[had long been broken.]

697
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,080
[Fang Wei'an did give me]

698
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,600
[the long-lost sense of security,]

699
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,440
[but some scars]

700
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,360
[are destined to stay forever.]

701
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,600
[They're carved into my bones,]

702
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,440
[impossible to erase.]

703
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,920
It's already past the time.

704
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,360
Just call and ask.

705
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't bother Mr. Yu.

706
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,320
Maybe he's busy.

707
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,240
We've been busting our asses,

708
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
but it's all for nothing.

709
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,680
Guess we're just not

710
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,840
meant to be rich.

711
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,920
He said he'd get back at seven,

712
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,040
so he owes us a reply.

713
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,080
If you won't call, I will.

714
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,280
Hey, give me the phone!

715
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
No way!

716
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,760
[Your phone service has been suspended.]

717
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,200
[For more information,]

718
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,320
[please call 10086.]

719
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,560
Dude!

720
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,280
Your phone's cut off!

721
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,640
My phone's out of credit?

722
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,320
All set?

723
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,800
Hurry up and call!

724
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,080
Is that Mr. Ma?

725
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,680
How's it?

726
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,520
It's a yes!

727
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,840
Yes?

728
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,800
Xiaoyun!

729
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,560
It's a yes!

730
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,400
Yes!

731
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,440
Yes!

732
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,320
Told you we'll make it!

733
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,040
What about the others?

734
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,440
I need to call my parents.

735
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,680
Call them! Come on!

[Chen Jun Law Firm]

737
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,080
Attorney Dai.

738
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,840
Had a bad sleep?

739
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Heard that

740
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,160
this year's

741
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,800
Lawyers Forum is a big event.

742
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,640
Nearly all top domestic law firms

743
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,680
have sent representatives.

744
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,680
It's a rare opportunity.

745
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
Are you really not going to

746
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,160
attend with Kang Jun?

747
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
Sounds like this forum

748
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,360
is a better fit for you.

749
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,440
I don't need this.

750
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
But for you,

751
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,920
at such authoritative events,

752
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,040
more exposure

753
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,239
will do you good.

754
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,400
The new boss

755
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,440
even got you to persuade me.

756
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,719
You know he's your boss, right?

757
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,400
He's not just yours

758
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,719
but mine.

759
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,199
That kind of boring forum

760
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,639
is simply not for me.

761
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,320
There's no point in me going.

762
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,120
I don't handle non-litigation practice.

763
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,800
And I've saved face

764
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,239
for him last time.

765
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,600
If he likes socializing, let him go.

766
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,800
No one's stopping him.

767
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,520
A boss can't

768
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
force us, can he?

769
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,719
I'll pass on your words.

770
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,040
It's up to you.

771
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,040
[Caller ID: Lan]

772
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,360
Lan,

773
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,200
[Yingying,]

774
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
[Can you come to Guangzhou?]

775
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
[Hu...]

776
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,520
[He's dying.]

777
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,760
I've thought about this

778
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,200
very carefully.

779
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,520
I think

780
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,160
given my age and seniority,

781
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,840
I really do need

782
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,720
this chance to gain experience.

783
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,040
So I have to

784
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
go to Guangzhou.

785
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,800
Five minutes ago,

786
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,840
you said it was meaningless.

787
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,200
Force us to attend business galas.

788
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,280
What's wrong?

789
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,080
What a quick change of mind!

790
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,240
I gotta listen to reason in this line of work.

791
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,920
Play some music?

792
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Fine.

793
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,920
Which genre?

794
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,640
Suit yourself.

795
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,600
Alright, I'll pick one at random.

796
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,520
Is that okay?

797
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,880
We're here.

798
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
We've been busy all day

799
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,840
and haven't even eaten.

800
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,720
How about I treat you

801
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,240
to a late-night snack?

802
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
Director Kang,

803
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,480
an invite after work

804
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,440
is called a date.

805
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
You go ahead. I'll check in.

806
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,680
Tastes good?

807
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,480
Waiter, get him another dish.

808
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,480
Sure, I'm coming.

809
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,280
Miss, no seats left.

810
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,520
How about waiting a bit?

811
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,720
Could you help me share a table?

812
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,960
Sure, outside.

813
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,480
Sir!

814
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,080
There's a lady

815
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,320
wanting to share your table, okay?

816
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,720
I'll just have a bite and leave.

817
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,040
What a coincidence!

818
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,840
You know each other?

819
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,160
What a fate! Enjoy it.

820
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,240
Thank you.

821
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,640
If we were destined to be here,

822
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,320
why did you turn me down?

823
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,760
Tastes good?

824
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,080
Of course.

825
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,440
I found this place

826
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,680
on social media.

827
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,840
Said the food's pretty good here.

828
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,280
What about you?

829
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,240
Waiter, a dozen beers, please!

830
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,040
Okay!

831
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,960
A dozen beers?

832
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,240
Two are enough for me.

833
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,600
It's not for you.

834
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,120
A dozen's not even

835
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
enough for me.

836
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,720
It's okay.

837
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Just throw it up.

838
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,600
Get it all out.

839
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,640
No, no, no!

840
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Something wrong with the beer.

841
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
Okay, you're right.

842
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,440
But next time,

843
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,280
just a small sip is fine.

844
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,640
Watch out.

845
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,400
We're almost there.

846
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
Turn right up ahead.

847
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,400
The car's right there.

848
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,960
Help!

849
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,320
What's wrong?

850
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
Help!

851
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,160
Is there anyone?

852
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Give it to me!

853
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,640
To me!

854
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,120
Give it!

855
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,480
Let go! Let go!

856
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
Let go! Let go! Let go!

857
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,520
Alright, alright!

858
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,560
Enough! What are you doing?

859
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,320
Who are you?

860
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,800
How dare you hit him?

861
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,760
Did you yell for help?

862
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,160
He's my boyfriend!

863
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,760
Sorry, she's drunk.

864
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,720
Take it easy. We're lawyers.

865
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,600
So what?

866
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,640
So you can hit people for no reason?

867
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,440
Which firm are you from?

868
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,160
Call the police!

869
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,520
She said call the police?

No...

Fine, call the police now!

Wait...

I'm not done with you!

874
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,880
We apologize, okay?

875

2000 yuan.

876
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,680
- 500 yuan.
- That's not enough.

877

3000 yuan!

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,000
Excuse me.

I'm driving!

881
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,760
Hurry up, I'm gonna throw up!

882
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,320
No, don't do that.

Tang Yingying, don't!

884
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,560
Did I just

885
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,960
hit someone?

886
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
You remember that?

887
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,200
You slapped him three times!

888
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,760
We paid 2000 yuan in compensation.

889
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,760
Otherwise,

890
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,280
we were picked up by the police.

891
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,680
Assault and affray,

892
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,400
causing minor injuries to others,

893
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
does not constitute a criminal offense.

894
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,120
According to the Public Security Administration Punishment Law,

895
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,200
the offender shall be punished.

896
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,400
in administrative detention

897
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,960
or a fine.

No one. Come on.

- How much is it?
- Let's go.

903
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,280
What?

904
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,080
How much?

905
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,400
It's auto-deducted.

906
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,000
Auto-deducted, it's okay.

907
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,480
Let me support you.

908
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,920
I'm okay.

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
I can walk on my own.

910
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,200
Let me walk you upstairs.

911
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,720
Look at you...

912
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,720
Don't follow me around,

913

or I'll call the police.

914
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,880
You call the police?

915
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,960
What's wrong?

916
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,360
It starts at nine sharp.

917
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,800
Still hungover?

918
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,640
I stayed up late all last night.

919
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
What?

920
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,600
Are you sick?

921
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Oh no.

922
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,600
Let me take you to the hospital.

923
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,680
You're not okay.

924
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:27,880
Let's go.

925
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,000
On my period.

926
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,240
Then why did you

927
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,560
drink so much cold beer?

928
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,560
Alright.

929
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,680
Have a rest in your room.

930
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,000
Lie down.

931
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,440
Is that okay?

932
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,520
Why wouldn't it be?

933
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,960
It's just an opening ceremony.

934
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,320
Tell me whatever

935
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,960
you want to eat or drink.

936
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,280
The attendant will bring it to your room.

937
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,200
Just stay in your room.

938
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,920
If you need anything else,

939
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,120
just call me.

940
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,520
I'm all by myself.

941
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,440
Okay.

942
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
This way, please.

Not bad.

- Okay.
