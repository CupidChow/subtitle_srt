3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,720
Can you tell me

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,280
why you're so

5
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,840
determined to attend the trial?

6
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,880
People online say that I

7
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,560
seduced him for money and failed.

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,840
But I'm not.

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
I want to see him admit

10
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,039
that he's the criminal, not me.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,600
I shouldn't be facing

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,759
all that online abuse.

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,080
Alright.

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,760
Then let's proceed with you attending the trial.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,680
Let's talk.

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,520
First, there is a

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,639
very key question.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
In your statements to the police,

19
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,680
to the prosecution,

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,560
and even to me

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,079
about the case

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
are they all factual?

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,079
Attorney Kang,

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
I don't understand what you mean.

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,440
The other side's defense lawyer

26
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
came to your home.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,040
She asked you about the day of the incident

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,320
in the hotel restroom

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,400
She saw you.

30
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,440
Can you explain to me

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,680
why she asked you that?

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
I didn't expect

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
the world would be so small

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,840
and have such a coincidence.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
She also attended the wedding.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
Yes, she was at the wedding too.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,640
And she saw something.

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,400
According to her,

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,720
your statement

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,640
contains some falsehoods

41
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,760
inconsistent with the facts.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,600
If during the trial

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,360
she presents

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
some evidence

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
that is highly unfavorable to you

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
and the content of which

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,320
we still don't know.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,360
Do you know how serious the consequences would be?

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,320
Zhang Yi

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm here to help you.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
If you're unwilling to tell me,

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
unwilling to tell the truth

53
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,200
you may have your reasons.

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
But as your lawyer,

55
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
I must remind you

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,760
False accusation and framing

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
is a serious act that undermines

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,160
judicial justice

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
and carries criminal liability.

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
I didn't falsely accuse him

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
He did force himself on me!

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
I did have feelings for him

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,480
but he insulted me,

64
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
tried to assault me,

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,040
and showed me no respect at all.

66
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,520
He treated me like that,

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,160
I must see him punished in court

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,920
with my own eyes.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,720
There's a concept here.

70
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
we can't confuse

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
You're suing him

72
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,000
because you confirm

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,880
he committed acts of forced indecency,

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,480
not just for the sake of punishment.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,240
I confirm it.

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,560
I said no,

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
but he kept going

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,160
Alright. Then let's

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,280
return to that earlier question.

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,240
Tell me,

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
that day in the restroom,

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,680
when Attorney Tang saw you,

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,399
what were you doing?

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,320
What could I do in a restroom?

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
There were so many people coming and going,

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
What exactly I did,

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
I really can't remember.

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,680
This incident has hurt me deeply.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,120
Attorney Kang, you're here to help me.

90
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,880
You just said so.

91
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,960
Yes, I'm here to help you.

92
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,280
It's my duty to help you.

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,560
But

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
I still need to remind you,

95
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,520
in the courtroom,

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,520
for every question you are asked

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
you must think carefully

98
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
and answer truthfully.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,720
Absolutely no lying,

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
and no fabricating facts.

101
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,159
Do I make myself clear?

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Is this to make up for

103
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,480
ditching me for your beau?

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,520
It was indeed my fault.

105
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
Mr. Qi Wen

106
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,600
being so lovey-dovey with you every day,

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,400
he's not plotting

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
for a third child with you, is he?

109
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,040
Qi Wen said he wouldn't pressure me.

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Wealthy families, past and present, east and west,

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
share the same obsession

112
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,600
with having a male heir.

113
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,360
The trial is about to start.

114
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,880
Every time at this moment,

115
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,200
I feel a bit excited

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,920
but also a bit nervous.

117
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,880
It's this feeling of challenge

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
and conquest

119
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
that I enjoy the most.

120
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
It's also our most shining moment

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
as lawyers.

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
I used to feel the same way.

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,159
It's just that with this case,

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
what will happen tomorrow

125
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200
is still uncertain.

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,840
But after all, this is

127
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,440
all the evidence I could find.

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,240
Sometimes evidence can prove a point,

129
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,240
but it doesn't necessarily solve.

130
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,520
I've always admired

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
your attitude towards cases.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
Since you've done your utmost,

133
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,040
leave the rest to the court.

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,760
Here, have a drink.

135
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,080
Attorney Tang Yingying

136
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,200
Good luck

137
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
[Trial Day]

138
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
Since you insist on appearing in person

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,880
Then face it bravely.

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,760
But you must remember

141
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,080
what I told you.

142
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,800
I can do it.

143
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,480
Futian District People's Court of Shenzhen

144
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,920
is now in session.

145
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
The defendant Shi Li,

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,680
in the case of Coercive Indecent Assault.

147
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Counsel, please state your cross-examination opinions.

148
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,920
In the third

149
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,080
inquiry record, the victim stated

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,920
that during the wedding reception

151
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,440
she drank a lot of alcohol

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,560
and became intoxicated and confused,

153
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,960
rendering her unable to resist.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,720
However, our evidence shows

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,840
that when the victim was being urged to drink

156
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,760
and she secretly

157
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,000
poured the alcohol away,

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
at that moment her consciousness

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
was very clear,

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
and not unconscious

161
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
as she claimed.

162
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,480
This is inconsistent

163
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
with her statement to the police.

164
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,320
Specific evidence

165
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
will be presented

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,840
during our subsequent evidence presentation.

167
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Cross-examination concluded.

168
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,159
Does the defendant have any evidence

169
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,440
to submit to the court?

170
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,240
No.

171
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
Counsel, please present your evidence.

172
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,680
Our video evidence

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,600
has been submitted to the clerk before the trial.

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,240
Evidence one is the video

175
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
from the wedding banquet on the day of the incident.

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
The evidence shows the victim

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,320
was very restrained in her drinking

178
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
on the day of the incident.

179
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,440
Therefore, the victim was not

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
in a state of intoxication

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
or confusion that day.

182
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,160
Prosecutor, please state your opinion on the evidence

183
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,960
The prosecution believes

184
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,640
this evidence is irrelevant to the case.

185
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Does the victim have any opinion?

186
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,840
I request my attorney to speak.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,560
The victim's attorney,

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,040
do you have any opinion?

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
The representative has three points.

190
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
First,

191
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,400
this video

192
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,720
only proves that the victim

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,760
was drinking very moderately that evening

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,960
While pouring, she was sober

195
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
but this does not prove she was

196
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
sober at the time of the incident or all night.

197
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,559
Second,

198
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,039
this video cannot prove

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
exactly how much alcohol

200
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,039
the victim consumed that night.

201
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Moreover, everyone's tolerance

202
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,480
to alcohol is different.

203
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Third,

204
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
The amount of alcohol consumed

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
has no bearing on

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
whether the victim was forced.

207
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Counsel, please continue presenting evidence.

208
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,280
Evidence two

209
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,520
consists of their WeChat voice

210
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
chat records.

211
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
We have also prepared

212
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,600
a video CD of it.

213
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,280
Play the second CD.

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Are you busy?

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,760
Why aren't you replying?

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
I have an engagement.

217
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,120
What's up?

218
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
I found that English material

219
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,240
you asked me to look for last time.

220
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,720
I want to bring it to you.

221
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,160
It's too late, I won't disturb you.

222
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,920
I'll get it from you another day.

223
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,680
When it's about you,

224
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
it's never too late to disturb.

225
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
This content

226
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
proves two facts.

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
First,

228
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
the two were not strangers.

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,760
Second,

230
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,760
Their private communication

231
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,800
was extensive.

232
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,840
Moreover, in the two weeks

233
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,000
prior to the incident,

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
they arranged to meet multiple times.

235
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,640
However, in the statement Zhang Yi

236
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,440
provided to the police,

237
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
she claimed they were not close

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
and had rarely met.

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
This is inconsistent

240
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,840
with the video chat content.

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Therefore, Zhang Yi's testimony

242
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
lacks credibility.

243
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,240
Prosecutor, please state your opinion on the evidence.

244
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,640
Relevance is not recognized.

245
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,080
Does the victim have any opinion?

246
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
No opinion.

247
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,560
The victim's attorney,

248
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,680
do you have any opinion?

249
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,080
No opinion.

250
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,760
Counsel, please continue presenting evidence.

251
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,800
We now request

252
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,080
to play the third video.

253
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,520
Hello!

254
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm your steamer's friend, Jiayi!

255
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,440
Here in the bustling city center...

256
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
This video was unintentionally captured

257
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,360
by a self-media streamer

258
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,800
during a live stream.

259
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
We have enhanced the audio

260
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
for the key parts.

261
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,800
It's said

262
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,120
that this wedding company

263
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
is a top choice for newlyweds.

264
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,800
Come on, let's take a selfie.

265
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,440
Shi Li,

266
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,800
am I your girlfriend?

267
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,400
Am I your girlfriend?

268
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,960
This video proves

269
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
a third fact

270
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,600
that the victim had foresight

271
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,480
and anticipation regarding

272
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,440
intimate acts with Shi Li.

273
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,400
and even took active steps.

274
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Your Honor, the defense requests

275
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
to question the victim.

276
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
Requesting the court's permission.

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,080
Permission granted.

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
Zhang Yi, did you enter

279
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
the room with Shi Li

280
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,400
willingly and consciously?

281
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Yes.

282
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:30,840
According to

283
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
your statement to the police,

284
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,040
you said that once the two of you

285
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,920
entered the room,

286
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,960
Shi Li pulled you

287
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,400
to sit on his lap, is that correct?

288
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,040
Yes.

289
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
So,

290
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
when you were kissing Shi Li,

291
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,960
who initiated the move?

292
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,360
If you don't want to answer,

293
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,200
you may refuse.

294
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
Please answer.

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,440
I...

296
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,120
I can't remember clearly.

297
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
"Can't remember clearly" means

298
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,760
you don't recall whether you

299
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
explicitly initiated moving closer to Shi Li?

300
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,440
Is that it?

301
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,160
Objection!

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
The defense counsel is leading the witness.

303
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
We ask the collegial panel to intervene.

304
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,520
Counsel, please mind your questioning.

305
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,640
Fine. I'll rephrase.

306
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,560
Then let me ask

307
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,360
Did Shi Li initiate kissing you?

308
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,800
You're so beautiful...

309
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,160
Yes... he was the one who kissed me first.

310
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
So when he pulled you

311
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,960
onto the chair and kissed you,

312
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,920
did you resist or refuse?

313
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
Shi Li...

314
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,200
No.

315
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
Your statement says

316
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
that afterwards, the two of you

317
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,680
changed positions.

318
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,240
You ended up lying on the sofa,

319
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,280
with Shi Li on top of you.

320
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,520
During this process

321
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
of changing  positions,

322
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
did you resist or refuse?

323
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,040
I...

324
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,160
I didn't refuse.

325
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,880
Then at what point

326
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,480
and in what manner, did you express

327
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,920
that you did not consent

328
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
to further intimacy?

329
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,360
He suddenly started insulting me.

330
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,960
Vile insults.

331
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,080
I told him to stop.

332
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
But he still grabbed my hands

333
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,120
and restrained me.

334
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,800
Which hand did he use to restrain you?

335
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,920
Both hands.

336
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,080
Yet in your statement, you claimed

337
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,280
that while restraining you with his hand

338
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,800
he also covered your mouth with his hand.

339
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,200
If

340
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
he was restraining you with both hands,

341
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,120
then may I ask,

342
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,440
how did he manage to cover your mouth?

343
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
I... I don't know.

344
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,640
Please clarify for the court.

345
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,280
Which of your statements

346
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,320
is the truthful one?

347
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,600
I told you I don't know!

348
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,800
I really can't remember clearly!

349
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
I was in a complete daze.

350
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,680
At that moment, I couldn't even process

351
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
whether he used one hand or two.

352
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,200
I don't know.

353
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,400
Calm down. Calm down.

354
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Stay calm.

355
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,840
Take your time.

356
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,600
Breathe.

357
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Then, in what state

358
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,920
did you leave the room?

359
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,600
I was crying.

360
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,480
I told him to stop.

361
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
But it was like he couldn't even hear

362
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,360
what I was saying.

363
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
Then I pushed him away

364
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
and left the room.

365
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,680
From the moment you first expressed

366
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,720
resistance and refusal

367
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,760
until Shi Li let you go,

368
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,440
how long did that period last?

369
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,800
I don't know.

370
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,360
How long?

371
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,280
Roughly...

372
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,200
Six or seven minutes.

373
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
You stated that you only began

374
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,360
to express refusal

375
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,000
after hearing Shi Li's insults.

376
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,920
So, from entering the room

377
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,960
until the moment before

378
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,000
Shi Li insulted you,

379
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,440
you were voluntarily

380
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
engaging in intimate acts with him.

381
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,000
Is that correct?

382
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,800
I object!

383
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,440
Counsel is asking a leading question,

384
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,200
and moreover, this question

385
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,360
is irrelevant to determining

386
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,880
the act of forcible indecency in this case.

387
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,560
Your Honor, this is crucial.

388
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,720
From the time before Zhang Yi perceived

389
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,240
the abuse from Shi Li and decided

390
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,840
to object,

391
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,360
whether Zhang Yi was

392
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,960
knowing and consenting

393
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,280
to the intimate acts is

394
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,120
vital for determining

395
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,720
Shi Li's motive and subjective intent.

396
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,760
Counsel may continue questioning.

397
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,680
But mind your questioning manner.

398
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,600
Let me put it another way.

399
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,840
Zhang Yi,

400
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,720
if Shi Li had not insulted you,

401
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,600
would you have been willing

402
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
to continue the intimate acts with him?

403
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,040
If he hadn't insulted me like that...

404
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
I might not have pushed him away.

405
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,360
Before that, I did have

406
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,400
feelings for him.

407
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,680
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

408
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,080
My questioning is complete.

409
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,520
Court investigation is concluded.

410
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
The opinions expressed by

411
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,960
both prosecution and defense during cross-examination

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,720
have been heard clearly by this court

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
and recorded.

414
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
We now proceed to court debate.

415
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
Both sides should focus your arguments

416
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,880
primarily on

417
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,920
the facts, evidence for conviction and sentencing,

418
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,440
and the application of law.

419
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,160
Points already raised during

420
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,760
the court investigation

421
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,840
need not be repeated.

422
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
Does the victim have anything to add?

423
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,840
May I request...

424
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
a recess?

425
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,800
Today's session is adjourned.

426
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,280
The date for the next session

427
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,240
will be announced separately.

428
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,240
Court is adjourned.

429
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,240
Go wait for me in the car.

430
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,840
Alright.

431
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,720
Attorney Kang, instead of comforting

432
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
your client now at this moment,

433
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
do you have some instruction for me?

434
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I must say,

435
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,800
your methods are truly...

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
bloodless murder.

437
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,240
My work procedure is legal and compliant.

438
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,960
The evidence I submitted is authentic and valid.

439
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,160
If you call that

440
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
a "method,"

441
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,440
I believe your choice of words is inappropriate.

442
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
In the courtroom,

443
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,640
using that manner

444
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,760
to press for details,

445
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,520
do you find that appropriate?

446
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,280
This is a courtroom

447
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,720
not a kindergarten.

448
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,120
In a lawsuit,

449
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,840
behind victory or defeat lies not just a lawyer's

450
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,120
conscience and bottom line,

451
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,640
but also justice and public sentiment.

452
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,680
What should determine the outcome of a case

453
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,600
is the evidence

454
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,680
presented to the court

455
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,440
not the "conscience" you speak of.

456
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,520
Moreover, shouldn't the conscience you mention

457
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
be based on facts

458
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,000
rather than lies?

459
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,560
You protect your client's

460
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,600
demands and objectives.

461
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,960
I protect my client's

462
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,920
legitimate rights and interests.

463
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,240
Is there a problem with that?

464
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,080
No problem.

465
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
By any means necessary.

466
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Fine.

467
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,000
And you don't?

468
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
Attorney Kang,

469
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,840
don't tell me

470
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
you've never cut corners to win a case

471
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,480
in your career life.

472
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,760
Not once?

473
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,520
Never?

474
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,680
Zhang Yi is suspected of false accusation.

475
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,760
We reserve the right

476
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
to pursue legal action.

477
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
You should be ready for that.

478
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,680
Attorney Kang!

479
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,400
Um...

480
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,920
Attorney Kang,

481
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,680
my daughter is missing.

482
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
We waited outside.

483
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,400
She came out

484
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,840
and said she needed the bathroom.

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,480
She left her phone in there

486
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,880
and just disappeared.

487
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Stay calm.

488
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,760
Try to reach her.

489
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,040
What's wrong?

490
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,240
Zhang Yi is missing.

491
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
She must be close.

492
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,840
Search nearby.

493
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,320
Okay.

494
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,440
Stop recording!

495
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,200
Keep it down!

496
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,760
Just a kid.

497
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
Heartbroken and doing something desperate.

498
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,200
Yeah, terrible.

499
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,320
I heard she's the one from online

500
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,080
suing that guy for cash.

501
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
That's her?

502
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah, I've heard the stories.

503
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,400
No matter what,

504
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
she shouldn't jump into the sea.

505
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,560
Right.

506
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
Don't come closer!

507
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,560
Stay back, all of you!

508
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,080
Yeah.

509
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
Incoming call from Kang Jun.

510
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
Accept or decline?

511
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,600
Hello?

512
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Zhang Yi is on the cross-sea bridge.

513
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,480
She's going to jump.

514
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
On my way.

515
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
Got it. Coming now.

516
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,200
Zhang Yi!

517
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,200
Stay back!

518
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Don't come closer!

519
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,840
You won.

520
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,240
I give up.

521
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Zhang Yi!

522
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
The trial isn't over yet.

523
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
This is too extreme.

524
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,600
It doesn't matter anymore.

525
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
You're right.

526
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,440
Adults

527
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
must take responsibility.

528
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
Ending up like this,

529
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,240
I brought it upon myself.

530
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,520
I deserve it.

531
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,120
Now, I just want it all to end.

532
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,200
Attorney Kang, thank you for always helping me.

533
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,080
Zhang Yi, you're only twenty-six.

534
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,440
Your life is just beginning.

535
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
That's not helping! Just stop!

536
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,960
Zhang Yi,

537
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,280
I know you love Iceland.

538
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,600
And the Northern Lights.

539
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
I know you want to see

540
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
the lands beyond the Wall, from Game of Thrones.

541
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,760
Listen,

542
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,120
I've been to those places.

543
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
The views are incredible.

544
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,880
You'd regret it forever if you never go.

545
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,640
That's the end of the world, isn't it?

546
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,800
Guess I've reached mine.

547
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,520
No, how can that be the end?

548
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,600
You're only twenty-six.

549
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,240
Your life is just getting started.

550
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,040
Think about the things you love,

551
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,920
your coconut latte,

552
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
white roses,

553
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,280
rainbows after a storm.

554
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,160
Just think.

555
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,080
Attorney Tang checked her Weibo.

556
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,040
I want to see the world.

557
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,120
But I'm trapped.

558
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,400
I can't break free.

559
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
I can't.

560
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,280
Rescue team standing by.

561
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
What's the status on the bridge?

562
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
Family's on the way.

563
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,760
Her lawyer's here.

564
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,960
Attempting communication.

565
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,880
Listen up,

566
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,280
all personnel near the edge

567
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,240
get your safety gear on now.

568
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,840
Understood?

569
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,400
Yes.

570
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Move, move!

571
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,360
Make way, we're family!

572
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,000
Yi!

573
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,880
Yi!

574
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,280
Mom, stay back!

575
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
Don't come closer!

576
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
I don't blame you anymore.

577
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,520
Come down, don't do this.

578
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,200
You're my only hope

579
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,720
in this world.

580
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Yi.

581
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,360
Zhang Yi,

582
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,760
think about your parents

583
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,920
What would they do without you?

584
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,680
Sweetie, please.

585
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,480
Dad, Mom.

586
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,840
Zhang Yi, give me your hand.

587
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,480
Take it!

588
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,560
Grab it!

589
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,520
Look, her parents are here.

590
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,480
Can you imagine what they're going through?

591
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,000
Come down, sweetheart.

592
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,840
Listen,

593
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,000
nothing in life is worth more than living.

594
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,320
Hey!

595
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,280
Stop recording!

596
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,600
Yeah, put it away!

597
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,560
What are you even filming this for?

598
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,160
Ms. Zhang, for the time being

599
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
you need to stay away from school.

600
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
Have you even thought about anyone else?

601
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,520
Dad, Mom, I'm sorry.

602
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,600
Oh my god, she jumped!

603
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,280
She really jumped.

604
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,960
She went over!

605
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,920
Yi! Yi!

606
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,520
Mr. Tang!

607
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,760
Mr. Tang!

608
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
She has soft tissue contusions.

609
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
Rest is all she needs.

610
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,480
Here's an ice pack.

611
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
Apply it when she wakes up.

612
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,040
Okay.

613
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,840
Thank you.

614
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,800
You're awake. Good.

615
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,360
I'm Captain Fang Wei'an,

head of

617
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,040
the rescue team.

618
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,040
I pulled you and the girl

619
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,560
from the water.

620
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,640
She's still unconscious.

621
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,960
Your injuries are minor.

622
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Fang Wei'an.

623
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,080
You remembered. That's good.

624
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,360
Means no head injury.

625
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,480
But you just woke up,

626
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,600
so take it easy.

627
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,400
Let me

628
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,920
get some ice on that.

629
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,560
First time I've seen a lawyer

dive in like that.

631
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,800
How did you know?

632
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,280
It's all over the internet.

633
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
Hero lawyer.

634
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,560
Get some rest.

635
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,400
Mr. Tang.

636
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
How much longer should I keep this on?

637
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,880
Just a bit longer.

638
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,440
It helps reduce the swelling.

639
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,680
Try to get some rest.

640
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,840
Feeling any better?

641
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,560
Honestly,

642
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,080
I've never met

643
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,640
a lawyer

644
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,120
quite like you.

645
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,080
It was an honor

646
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
to face you in court.

647
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,120

649
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
gone through this together,

650
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,600
we might've

651
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,840
ended up friends.

652
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,480
Could've been.

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200

Alright.

What's it about?

659
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,360
Someone filed a complaint against me with the Association.

660

Attorney Kang,

670
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,960
what drove Zhang Yi to this?

671
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,040
Was she overwhelmed

672
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,120
by the public pressure?

673
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,280

No.

During the case,

683
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,440
did you coach your client

684

to orchestrate a smear campaign

685
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,640

You like white roses.

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,040
Is it because

701
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,360
they stand for a promise of love?

702
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080

Attorney Tang,

708
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,560
I never thanked you for saving me.

709
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,320
Don't mention it.

710
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,120
You woke up

Can I ask you something?

713
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,840
Of course.

714
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,320
Why did you take this case?

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,840
I want the truth from you.

716

You were right.

I wasn't drunk.

718
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,080
But

719
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,720
just because I was sober,

720
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,360
does that mean

721
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,280
I was asking for it?

722
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,040
I considered

dating Shi Li.

724
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,440

the right

726
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,560

things could turn out like that.

to be someone respectable.

772
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,920
I saved for months

773
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,280
for a pair of

774
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,440
ten-thousand-yuan heels.

775
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,080
Can you believe it?

776
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,000
But those expensive heels

777
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,280
aren't any more comfortable

778
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,320
than cheap shoes.

779
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,640
I only wore them for two days,

780
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
and they tore up my heels.

781
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,440
But I kept wearing them anyway.

782
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,160
Because I thought good shoes

783
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,800
could take me somewhere.

784
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
So I kept up

785
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,720
the act.

786
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,040
But on my unseen feet,

787
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,840
were bleeding, festering wounds.

788
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,600
That was the real me.

789
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,120
Meeting Shi Li made me see

790
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
what I saw as luxuries

791
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,800
were just everyday things to him.

792
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,520
He was that kind of guy,

793
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,840
young, accomplished, well-mannered.

794
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,160
I wanted to be his girlfriend.

795
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
This wish of mine

796
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,199
might seem laughable. Materialistic.

797
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,639
But,

798
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
is it a crime?

799
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,800
What hurts most is

800
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,960
I truly liked him.

801
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,880
But he just crushed my sincerity.

802
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,600
Back then, I just wanted him

803
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,840
to pay for it.

804
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
And that's the truth

805
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,360
you were looking for.

806
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,920
Attorney Tang,

807
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,159
I just want this to be over.

808
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,840
[Is she awake yet?]

809
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,320
[If you're free,

810
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,640
let's grab a drink to celebrate.]

811
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,960
But he just crushed my sincerity.

812
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,680
Back then, I just wanted him

813
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
to pay for it.

814
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,400
And that's the truth

815
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,520
you were looking for.

816
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Attorney Tang,

817
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,040
I just want this to be over.

818
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,760
I need your help.

819
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,920
Please.

820
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,400
Trust me.

821
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,600
Tomorrow will be better.

822
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,520
I was so sure

823
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,160
it was all an act

824
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,600
by Zhang Yi.

825
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,040
I was obsessed with

826
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,520
finding that ironclad truth.

827
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,600
But I failed

828
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,480
to see the person

829
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,280
hidden behind

830
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
the victim's shadow.

831
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,360
The Shi Li case was like a mirror.

832
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,080
As I built

833
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,680
an unassailable defense

834
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
with stacks of evidence,

835
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,200
I neglected the other side,

836
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,440
where evil

837
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,920
hid in the blind spot,

838
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,120
revealing its nature

839
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,840
in ways I never noticed.

840
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,240
[Are You a Good Lawyer?]

841
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,680
I need to rethink

842
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,800
how to find

843
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,400
a glimmer of warmth

844
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,200
between the cold letter of the law

845
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,760
and the human heart.

846
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,080
In the first-instance trial,

847
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,680
Shi Li is found guilty of forcible indecent assault.

848
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,720
He is sentenced to one year in prison,

849
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
suspended for two years.

850
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,040
The probation period

851
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,240
commences upon the judgment taking effect.

852
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,240
Shi Li is back home.

853
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,520
Aren't you going to be there for him?

854
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,920
What about the girl?

855
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,200
How is she?

856
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,680
They revived her.

857
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,760
Thankfully nothing worse happened.

858
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,520
If she had died,

859
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,920
it would've been

860
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,640
on our conscience

861
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
forever.

862
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,320
I know.

863
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,200
As a woman,

864
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,640
I know what she has lost.

865
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,240
Anyway,

866
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,640
the case is finally over.

867
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,600
All she's asked for

868
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
is

869
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,920
symbolic compensation.

870
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,480
I know what you're going to say.

871
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,720
She deserves

872
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,800
proper compensation for this.

873
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,200
I'll leave this in your hands.

874
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,800
Spare no expense.

875
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,480
To the outside world,

876
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,040
you seem unbreakable,

877
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,880
a tough, iron-willed woman.

878
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,760
But beneath

879
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,240
that tough exterior,

880
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,360
lies a compassion

881
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,520
few ever see.

882
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,680
A child

883
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,520
is a mother's weakness.

884
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,680
Shi Li needs to

885
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,160
reflect himself deeply.

886
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,400
He's finished

887
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,640
at Aina Group. For good.

888
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
Shi Li told me

889
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,400
his years of effort

890
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,920
were to take over Aina Group.

891
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,560
Yet he himself

892
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,360
threw it away.

893
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,920
I won't hand my life's work

894
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,760
to someone with a stain,

895
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
even my own flesh and blood.

896
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Yes.

897
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,240
Adults

898
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,080
must take responsibility.

899
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,200
Thank you, Ms. Ren, for trusting me.

900
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
This case

901
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,000
taught me much.

902
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,040
Tell your client

903
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,680
I don't buy it.

904
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,040
He won't

905
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,120
learn from guilt.

906
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,200
Only a price.

907
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
Next time he thinks about acting out,

908
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,200
let the millions

909
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
hold him back.

910
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,720
Don't worry.

911
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,760
Contract is being processed.

912
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,400
The facts are clear,

913
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,200
so the compensation shouldn't be a problem.

914
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,600
Is Zhang Yi been discharged?

915
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,240
Yes.

916
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,760
She's recovering at home.

917
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,480
Did you bring the agreement?

918
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,520
Let's talk terms.

919
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,400
Why's the amount blank?

920
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,000
Shouldn't

921
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,920
that be worked out

922
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,280
first?

923
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,440
Then name a number.

924
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,280
This is

925
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
your ask for her?

926
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,360
Yes.

927
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,800
That is Aina's bottom line.

928
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,680
Thank you, on her behalf.

929
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
But one question.

930
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,120
Why help her?

931
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,240
Do I need a reason?

932
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,880
Email me

933
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,920
the signed copy.

934
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Goodbye, Attorney Kang.

935
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,760
Goodbye.

936
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,440
Actually,

937
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,920
let's make it goodbye for good.

938
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,960
For good.

939
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,960
[Zhang Yi]

940
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,440
[Attorney Tang,

941
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,800
tomorrow will be better.]
