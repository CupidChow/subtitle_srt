00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,240
Still tastes the same here.

4
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,680
That's legit.

5
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,680
Attorney Kang,

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,680
Shenzhen to Beijing,

7
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,120
then back to Shenzhen again,

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,320
I've really

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,640
come knocking more than once.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,520
Good news is,

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,680
you finally showed up.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Hang on, Chen.

13
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,840
It's not like that.

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm in Shenzhen

15
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
to help a friend.

16
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
More like,

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm just returning a favor.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,360
No other agenda.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
At Chen Jun Law Firm,

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,160
you've got Dai Peilin.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,440
She's my senior.

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,440
Big deal lawyer in SZ-HK.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,440
Why not let her take your seat?

24
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,400
Peilin's good, no doubt.

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,400
But,

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
these past few years,

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,520
she's been buried in admin stuff,

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,520
all bits and pieces.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
And also,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
her husband's family

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,440
has a massive business.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,079
With that kind of life,

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,000
she won't grind like crazy.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,840
You're different.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,640
Top schools in China,

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,640
plus a top overseas degree.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
Not just your skills,

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm really looking at

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
your leadership.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,520
Hey, Chen.

41
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,440
Let's pause that for now.

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
But that case I had,

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
I do want to talk about it.

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,040
I know.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,760
Just because of your case,

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Attorney Tang Yingying

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,240
got called to All China Lawyers Association today

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,120
to be investigated.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
They said

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
someone filed a report under their real name.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
That was me.

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,840
I did it.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,440
Because I believe

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
a rule-of-law society

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,320
needs clear rules.

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,760
You can't just want to win,

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
focus on winning.

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,000
That's not the right way.

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
But the other day I saw her

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
risk her life

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
to save someone.

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
Honestly, I was shook.

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,920
I've never seen a lawyer

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
pull something like that.

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,480
I regretted it.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
I kind of respect her.

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,160
Tang Yingying...

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,200
She's my hopeless apprentice.

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
Don't take her too seriously.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,720
Still,

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,680
watching you two go at it,

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,400
I was totally into it.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,320
Attorney Kang,

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,400
wanna go another round

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
with my apprentice?

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,360
Shifu!

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Waiting for me?

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Shifu.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Can you do me a favor?

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Qian Peng's starting up

82
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,280
and made a pitch deck for funding.

83
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm not sure it's solid.

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
Can you pass it to Peilin,

85
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,000
let her take a look

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
and tell us if it works?

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,520
Why don't you give it to her?

88
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,440
I don't really have her ear.

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
You do.

90
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,680
Alright.

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
How's the startup going?

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,440
Just getting started.

93
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,320
We wanna get married, buy a place.

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,560
But both families

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
can't really help.

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,200
So we're taking a shot while we're young.

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
If it works out,

98
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,960
we'll be set.

If it doesn't,

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
he'll go back to his old job.

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,120
Okay.

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Bring it to her when I can.

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,480
Happy birthday to you!

104
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,280
Happy birthday to you!

Happy birthday, my goddess!

106
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,000
Also, a white porcelain tea set

107

has been delivered to your home.

Mr. Qi only does bags,

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,400
and jewelry.

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,320
Only you actually get

113
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,040
what I really like.

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
Don't be greedy.

115
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,240
Boss.

116
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
You've already got a guy

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,240
who's crazy about you,

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,920
and you still complain.

119
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,400
You women.

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,080
What've you got there?

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh yeah.

122
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,440
Lin Xiaoyun's boyfriend made it.

123
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,760
He wants you to give him some pointers.

124
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,520
All that roundabout stuff.

125
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,840
That girl puts way too much thought into it.

126
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
If she put that effort into work,

127
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,600
she'd be an independent lawyer by now.

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,520
Mr. Kang,

129
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
welcome to Chen Jun Law Firm.

130
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,040
Director Chen.

131
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,080
Attorney Kang,

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,440
Why don't we go to my office first,

133
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
and have a quick sit-down?

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,560
This way.

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,200
What's wrong?

136
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
What, see a ghost?

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah. Pretty much.

138
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
Feels like it.

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Let me introduce him first.

140
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,680
This is Kang Jun,

141
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,440
our new partner.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
Harvard Law doctorate.

143
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
And he's the one

144
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,280
I chased down again and again,

145
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,960
to take over at Chen Jun Law Firm.

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
You all know,

147
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,840
I've been saying I'd retire

148
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
for a whole year now.

149
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,000
So today,

150
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm officially stepping aside.

151
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,960
Thank you, everyone,

152
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,520
for everything you've done for the firm.

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,800
And I hope you'll all

154
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,440
support our new director

155
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,280
and keep things running strong.

156
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
Now, let's welcome

157
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,200
Director Kang to speak.

158
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
Director Chen's trust in me

159
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,280
has me nervous and excited.

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm lucky to have the chance

161
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
to work with so many

162
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
great lawyers here.

163
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm really glad.

164
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,520
I hope

165
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,280
we can learn from each other,

166
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
and grow together.

167
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,360
As for what's next,

168
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll keep it brief.

169
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,760
First, justice.

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,720
Never try

171
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
to cross the line of the law.

172
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,960
We're legal professionals;

173
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,600
we do things the right way.

174
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,680
Only the right way lasts.

175
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
Second, the future.

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,520
A successful firm

177
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
doesn't rely on just one or two

178
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,360
star lawyers.

179
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,320
It relies on every one of you here.

180
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
I hope each of you,

181
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
every lawyer here,

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
can find your place at Chen Jun Law Firm,

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,560
right here,

184
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
and get

185
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
your chance to shine.

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,520
Director Kang.

187
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,360
Welcome.

188
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
Looking forward to working together.

189
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
Same here.

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Ms. Tang.

191
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Yes, Director?

192
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
We'll be working together.

193
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,200
Hope we get along well.

194
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
You're the director.

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,920
I should be asking you to look after me.

196
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Looking for me?

197
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,559
Yes.

198
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,520
Is now a good time?

199
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,280
Sure, come in.

200
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,280
This way, Director.

201
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,600
Have a seat.

202
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,560
Sit, please.

203
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,920
We meet again.

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,880
Yeah.

205
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,920
We do.

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
Why didn't you go back to Beijing, Director?

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,960
Because of you.

208
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,800
I didn't realize

209
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
I was that charming.

210
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
You're very charming,

211
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,400
impressive,

212
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,520
the backbone of this firm,

213
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,920
and an independent lawyer.

214
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,960
Your future's huge.

215
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,640
Director.

216
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
You just got here,

217
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,160
you don't really know me yet.

218
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
So with me,

219
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
just say it straight.

220
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,920
You're being too roundabout.

221
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,040
I can't follow.

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
My brain can't keep up.

223
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,000
I looked into it.

224
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,360
A couple of years ago,

225
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,840
you and Dai Peilin

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
handled lots of non-litigation work.

227
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,520
But these past two years,

228
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,000
you switched up your style.

229
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
You've only taken litigation cases.

230
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
I really want to know

231
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,720
what happened.

232
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
Well, Director, it's like this.

233
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
I took non-lit work before

234
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
to broaden my horizons,

235
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
and fill gaps in my skills.

236
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,800
But personally,

237
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,840
interest-wise,

238
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
I prefer litigation.

239
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
A litigation case-

240
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,280
from intake to closing,

241
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,560
the timeline's unpredictable.

242
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,120
And the money?

243
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,120
Compared to capital-markets work,

244
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,360
the profit's miles apart-

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,640
way more than ten times.

246
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
Yeah.

247
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,720
For a lawyer,

248
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,840
the biggest cost is time.

249
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,160
You've only got 24 hours a day.

250
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,080
How you use them,

251
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
how you plan your time,

252
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
you've got to think it through properly.

253
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,960
Especially someone like you-

254
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
a senior lawyer.

255
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
Right. You're absolutely right.

256
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,440
Go on, Director.

257
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm listening.

258
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
You don't have to call me "Director".

259
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm used to you calling me Kang,

260
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,920
it sounds better-more natural.

261
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Sure.

262
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,080
So, can I invite you to be

263
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,000
a senior partner at Chen Jun Law?

264
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,520
Me?

265
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,240
Yes.

266
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
You've only just started,

267
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
and you're already offering me that.

268
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,200
That's...really sudden.

269
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,560
A bit overwhelmed.

270
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,640
I've looked into your background.

271
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,280
Funny you say that-

272
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,600
when you took the Zhang Yi case,

273
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,680
I'd already looked into

274
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,120
your profile.

275
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,800
Know who you're dealing with, right?

276
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
Respect your opponent - I get it.

277
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,640
Opponent? No.

278
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,320
Director,

279
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,640
you literally just said in the meeting,

280
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,960
now you're at Chen Jun Law,

281
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
we're colleagues.

282
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,920
And, Director,

283
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,240
I honestly think you should

284
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
take a look at our

285
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,360
young lawyers.

286
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,840
They're full of energy,

287
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,040
proper motivated.

288
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
As for me,

289
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm not really

290
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
ambitious like that.

291
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm used to doing things my way.

292
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,800
So you don't need to

293
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
expect too much from me.

294
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,080
Really, focus on the youngsters.

295
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Give them more chances.

296
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,240
Alright, I won't keep you.

297
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,400
Get back to it.

298
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Take care, Director.

299
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
Director Chen did tell me

300
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,200
you're the most

301
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,640
"distinctive" lawyer here.

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,560
That's great. Keep it that way.

[Yici Teahouse]

Shifu,

305
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
I always thought

306
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,880
you'd hand

307
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,160
the director's job at Chen Jun Law

308
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,440

309
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,680
Did you?

310
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Why-

311
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,720
you don't think Kang Jun's fit

312
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,080
to run the firm?

313
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,360
He's already run a firm

314
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,120
from booming to falling apart.

315
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
How can you possibly think

316
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,680
he can manage Chen Jun Law Firm well?

317
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,400
What happened before-

318
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,880
that wasn't on him.

A lot of the rumors going around

320

just isn't reliable.

I've known Kang Jun

322
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
for a long time.

323
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,880
What kind of person he is-

324
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,440
I know better than you.

325
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,800

327
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,840
you'll use this chance

328
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,800
to learn from him properly.

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,000

what he has

338
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
that's worth learning from.

you two have history.

But hasn't that blown over?

342
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm petty,

343
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,600

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,520
he'd actually be

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
a pretty good one.

579
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,840
What's wrong with women

580
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,240
inheriting things?

581
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,600
Wen, let me say this,

582
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,480
with your family's obsession,

583
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
sooner or later,

584
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
it'll destroy your marriage.

585
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,080
Brother, you really can't go.

586
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm begging you.

587
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,080
He did this to you

588
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,720
and thinks he can just hide?

589
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Is there no justice left?

590
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,560
This is a hospital.

591
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,440
If you go after him, you'll ruin his future.

592
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,800
Brother.

593
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,760
After everything he did to you,

594
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
asking him to pay the medical bills,

595
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,360
the recovery costs,

596
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,160
am I really being unreasonable?

597
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,080
Am I?

598
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,400
Your body, your life,

599
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,640
he ruined them all!

600
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,240
The least he can do is pay you!

601
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,400
I do it all for you!

602
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
Don't blame him,

603
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,920
that's all my fault!

604
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,560
Please, stop,

605
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm begging you.

606
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,040
He'll be ruined for this!

607
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,080
Look at you!

608
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,480
Get off me!

609
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,680
I beg you!

610
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,080
- Guizhong.
- Sir.

611
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,840
Please, stop.

612
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,560
Sir.

613
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,240
Calm down,

614
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,320
or we'll call the police

615
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,080
Who are you two?

616
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,560
Are you okay?

617
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,360
I got you.

618
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,400
She's my sister.

619
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,000
So?

620
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
You can't act like that.

621
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,520
You okay?

622
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,280
That's none of your business.

623
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,440
You two bitches,

624
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
stay out of it.

625
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
How dare you,

626
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,240
be careful how you speak,

627
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,720
verbal shaming is also illegal.

628
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,960
Liu Manli.

629
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,640
You're my sister.

630
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,840
I've been killing myself working

631
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,440
all these years,

632
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,520
and it's all for you.

633
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm not gonna sit here

634
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,800
and let that bastard

635
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
walk all over you.

636
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,040
I'll make him compensate you.

637
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,520
He owes you.

638
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,880
I'll handle it.

639
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,840
Guizhong.

640
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,960
Whatever happened,

641
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
take care of yourself.

642
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,720
I'm Tang Yingying,

643
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,520
a lawyer.

644
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Take my business card.

645
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,120
If you need any legal help,

646
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,200
contact me.

647
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
Do you need us to take you back?

648
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,440
Thanks,

649
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,640
but I can take care of myself.

650
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Thank you.

651
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,400
Thanks a lot.

652
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Let's go.

653
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,920
That woman,

654
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,480
though wearing a hospital gown,

655
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,560
is not a patient of Huamu Hospital.

656
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
I noticed her wristband.

657
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,880
Same old story.

658
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,360
Should be a guy

659
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,960
who works at that hospital

660
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,760
got her pregnant by accident.

661
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,520
They didn't expect that.

662
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
She's in the hospital now,

663
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,240
so she probably lost the baby.

664
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,400
Then her brother

665
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,440
wanted to ask that man

666
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,320
for compensation.

667
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
But the woman opposed.

668
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
That's why they argued.

669
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,880
Attorney Tang,

670
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
sharp as usual.

671
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,000
Let's go a bit further with this.

672
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,440
What kind of man did that?

673
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,720
Irresponsible,

674
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,840
and married,

675
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,040
he had no other way.

676
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,280
Nothing new under the sun.

677
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,520
Hello?

678
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,480
Sure.

679
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,400
9:30 a.m. tomorrow.

680
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
The reception room of the firm.

681
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,480
The address will be sent to you later.

682
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,440
The woman we just talked about?

683
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,800
Awesome, Pelin.

684
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,080
To the veteran who still roars.

685
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,080
[Chen Jun Law Firm]

686
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,480
Attorney Tang.

687
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,880
Discharged already?

688
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,400
Actually,

689
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,520
we asked for leave.

690
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,200
Well,

691
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,160
Attorney Tang.

692
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,160
I apologize for yesterday,

693
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,520
please don't take it personally.

694
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,080
Forget it.

695
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,440
What's your request?

696
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,160
Do we need to pay

697
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,520
for the consultation?

698
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,160
I can give you

699
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,560
a 30-minute free consultation.

700
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,000
May I have your names?

701
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm Liu Guizhong

702
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,520
She is Manli.

703
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,840
I just want to know,

704
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,080
can we sue that man

705
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,480
who hurt her?

706
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,960
Didn't find him yesterday?

707
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
How do you know?

708
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,440
We heard from the hospital,

709
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,400
they said

710
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
he's on annual leave.

711
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Obviously,

712
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
he's hiding.

713
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Actually,

714
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,920
when it comes to emotional betrayal,

715
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,680
we can only condemn him morally.

716
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,720
This is beyond

717
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,040
the reach of the law.

718
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,920
But under that Criminal Law,

719
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,480
article 258,

720
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,840
whoever has a spouse and commits bigamy,

721
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
or knowingly marries a person who has a spouse,

722
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,880
shall be sentenced to

723
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,520
fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 2 years

724
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,160
or criminal detention.

725
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,520
Is that clear enough?

726
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,960
Yes.

727
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,600
See,

728
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,080
that's what I mean.

729
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,880
He lied to my sister.

730
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,760
She bled a lot,

731
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
and he didn't even show up.

732
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,200
Her uterus was removed.

733
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,200
We'll sue him

734
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,000
for compensation.

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,280
I can't figure it out.

736
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,920
He said he loved me.

737
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,960
But how could he

738
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,200
do this to me?

739
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Miss. Liu,

740
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,840
do you know he was married

741
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,840
when you dated him?

742
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,760
Did he hide it from you

743
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,800
deliberately?

744
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,280
At first,

745
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,080
he said he was separated,

746
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,960
and about to divorce.

747
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,360
Then I found out that's a lie.

748
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,520
I wanted to break up.

749
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,720
But he begged me to stay.

750
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,080
I agreed,

751
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,160
and said

752
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,920
I'd wait for him.

753
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,240
While you were in the hospital,

754
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
did he

755
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,600
pay your medical bills?

756
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,480
Yes.

757
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,560
But just a deposit of 10,000 yuan,

758
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,040
then disappeared.

759
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,040
What's wrong with you?

760
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,000
Why him?

761
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,040
What a trash!

762
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,560
No doctor,

763
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,440
a bastard.

764
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
Mr. Liu,

765
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,040
calm down, please.

766
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,000
Based on

767
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,120
what you've described,

768
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,560
you can file a lawsuit

769
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,240
to claim civil damages from him.

770
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
But the point is,

771
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,800
Miss. Liu,

772
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,080
are you sure you want to sue?

773
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,160
No.

774
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
I won't.

775
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,920
If I do this,

776
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,760
his life will be ruined.

777
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,920
Sue him.

778
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,120
We must do that.

779
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,680
He must be tried.

780
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,960
No!

781
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,160
What are you saying?

782
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,440
Isn't that

783
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,520
why we're came?

784
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,760
You crazy?

785
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,160
Guizhong.

786
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,960
What's wrong with you?

787
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,840
- Guys.
- We must sue him.

788
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,560
- Well.
- Miss Tang.

789
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,320
How's that?

790
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,120
Contact me later

791
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,760
when you decide

792
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,880
whether to sue him?

793
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,240
All right?

794
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,400
Xiaoyun.

795
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,280
Nah.

796
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,640
Why are you here

797
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
if you're not gonna sue him?

798
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,480
You're just wasting

799
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,800
everyone's time.

800
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,480
You heard that,

801
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,440
we can ask him for compensation.

802
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,000
If we do this,

803
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
his life is over.

804
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
His life?

805
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,360
What about yours?

806
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,160
Mr. Liu.

807
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,560
This way, please.

808
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,560
Whose clients are they?

809
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,160
They're here for Attorney Tang.

810
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,480
It's not worth it.

811
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
What a waste of time

812
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,600
on these trivial cases.

813
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,400
She has her own judgment.

814
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,320
You should believe her.

815
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
Tang Yingying.

816
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,840
Has she ever lost?

817
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,160
Who dares say

818
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,440
they'll never lose?

819
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,120

820
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960

821
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,400
Reasonable price.

822
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,960
Xixi is only eight years old.

823
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,320
I think she's ...

824
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,600
Ages 3-10 are the golden period

825
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
to inspire her artistic potential.

826
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
One week apiece.

827
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,880
That's perfect.

828
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,800
My annual leave is all used up.

829
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
I'm busy too, okay?

830
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,160
Do you know how much I worked overtime

831
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,360
for this vacation?

832
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,320
What are you doing?

833
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,360
Don't you see a car here?

834
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,840
Dr. Qin.

835
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,800
I'm Manli's brother.

836
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,640
Do you remember her?

837
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,840
Mrs. Qin.

838
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,040
You're so elegant.

839
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,840
Thanks.

840
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,720
You're with the patient, right?

841
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,880
If you need help,

842
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,440
find him during his working hours.

843
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,720
I can't find him in the hospital,

844
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,840
that's why I'm here.

845
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,200
I'll handle it,

846
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
you take Xixi home.

847
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I'll be back in minutes,

848
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,720
just a few words.

849
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,360
Okay.

850
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,240
Bye, daddy.

851
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,960
That's my home,

852
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,080
what do you want?

853
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,680
Why don't you ask

854
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,800
how she's doing in the hospital?

855
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,080
How do you know

856
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
my home address?

857
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Don't you know,

858
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,240
you're invading my privacy?

859
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,800
It's illegal.

860
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,600
You violated my sister,

861
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,720
and her uterus was removed.

862
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,880
How dare you?

863
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,040
What do you want?

864
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,680
Here.

865
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,840
What do you want?

866
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,800
50,000 RMB.

867
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,120
Why should I transfer 50,000 to you?

868
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440

869
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,480
Watch your tone when you speak to me.

870
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
You know what,

871
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,200
we've already got a lawyer.

872
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,960
We've been told,

873
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,280
we can sue you,

874
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,720
for concealing the facts of your marriage,

875
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,800
and causing Manli to miscarry.

876
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,440
She stopped me.

877
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,920
Here.

878
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
This is not a banking interface.

879
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,440
That's my investment account.

880
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,680
I've looked into it.

881
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,800
Transfer can be reclaimed.

882
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,600
But this one,

883
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
is a financial product.

884
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,080
It's legal and safe.

885
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,000
Fine.

get out of my life for good.

889
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,160
That depends on Manli.

890
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,040
Pay up,

891
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
or the lawyer comes.

892
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,440
If my sister feels unwell,

893
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,160
I'll come to you again.

most of the down payment

Mr. Liu,

1154
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,240
are you in urgent need right now?

1155
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,920
And,

1156
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,640
whether she sue that hospital

1157
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,480
and medical staff or not,

1158
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,760
since Liu Manli,

1159
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,600
is a fully competent adult,

1160
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
her brother has no right to sue on her behalf.

1161
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,680
About that,

1162
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,320
I don't know

1163
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,720
how to tell her.

1164
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,840
After all, we all thought

1165
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,680
even Bai Yaqing

1166
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,720
removed Manli's uterus,

1167
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,400
she did

1168
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,520
save her life.

1169
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,760
I didn't expect...

1170
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,600
Miss Tang.

1171
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,840
Coffee.

1172
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,000
You're into that?

1173
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,520
A medical malpractice case

1174
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,080
is still worth a try.

1175
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,440
Wake up,

1176
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,520
don't get distracted

1177
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
by their messy character relationships.

1178
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,480
Director of Obstetrics at Huamu Hospital,

1179
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,640
a doctor like her,

1180
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
had no reason

1181
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,320
to do something so stupid.

1182
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,080
But that's way too coincidental.

1183
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,000
Since at Huamu,

1184
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
they two met me and Attorney Dai,

1185
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,680
it's already a coincidence.

1186
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,600
And that's the reason

1187
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,960
why we've helped them for free

1188
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,280
twice.

1189
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,000
The rest

1190
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,440
is up to them.

1191
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,800
Liu Guizhong wants to invite us

1192
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,360
to talk to Liu Manli

1193
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,040
about that operation.
