1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,800
I will never let you escape
again this time.

2
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,180
=Swap Face=

3
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,140
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,680
Just one step away.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,760
Who is

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
that man in black?

7
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,160
This is a woman's thing.

8
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,600
Chu Yan has been captured by me.

9
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,880
Come to Baizhang Forest on the
outskirts of the city at 1 pm today,

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,920
otherwise, Chu Yan's life will be in danger.

11
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
Du Chong.

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,520
Du Chong is crazy about killing Su Xiaoqiao,

13
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,840
and he even threatened me with
Chu Yan's life.

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,000
He is simply dreaming.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
(Su Xiaoqiao,)

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
(you are so stupid.)

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
(Not only did you get hurt,)

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,160
(but you also hurt Lord Chu.)

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,320
(Fortunately, Lord Chu
doesn't know my identity.)

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
(If he found out,)

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,120
(he would definitely kick me out
of Suzheng Office.)

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,920
(Lord Chu must be particularly
disappointed with me now.)

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,720
Chu Yan has been captured by me.

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,160
Come to Baizhang Forest on the
outskirts of the city at 1 pm today,

25
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,000
otherwise, Chu Yan's life will be in danger.

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,080
Du Chong.

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,120
Lord Chu has been captured.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,920
Signed by Du Chong.

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
Constable Shen,

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,840
free me right now, quick.

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,040
I'm going to save my husband.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,000
Miss Su,

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,160
something bad happened.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Lord Chu…

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,080
Lord Chu sneaked into

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,040
Qingfeng Village alone to capture

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
Chen Bai,

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
but he was captured

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,920
and was in danger.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,040
My husband is such a fool.

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Why did he go back alone?

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,840
Maybe Lord Chu didn't want to implicate us.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
I should have stopped him.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,320
It seems that Hua Pianpian

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,200
really took Chen Bai back to Qingfeng Village.

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Wait a second.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,040
How did you know?

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,080
We have spies in Qingfeng Village.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Come on, look at this.

50
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,860
(Chu Yan has been captured by me.)

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,360
Du Chong wants to use Lord Chu
to threaten Miss Su.

52
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,120
He just wants to force me to
go back and marry him.

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,990
This way he can inherit the position
of gang leader.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,000
So before that,

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
Lord Chu should be safe.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,800
Lord Chu is injured.

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,920
Even if Du Chong doesn't kill Lord Chu,

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,080
he will definitely not let
Lord Chu have an easy time.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm afraid Lord Chu can't bear it.

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,200
Or you can let me go.

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,640
So I can go to save my husband.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
But Lord Chu has given an order,

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,160
and I dare not disobey it.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,440
Don't be stupid.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
You can release me first,

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
and then make up a lie

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,400
that I escaped from prison.

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
How about that?

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,080
Sounds good.

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,800
Where is my key?

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
I lost my key.

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
The sun is so dazzling today.

73
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah, I can't see anything.

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Du Chong.

75
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
Come here.

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Show up.

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
Lord Chu,

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,840
your plan is brilliant.

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,920
- Du Chong.
- Miss Su was worried to death when she knew

80
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,240
- Just show up.
- that you were captured.

81
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,080
Enough.

82
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,200
Did you deliver it to Xiaoqiao?

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,040
Xiaoqiao did not respond.

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,320
She may not believe it

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,680
or she may not care.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,200
Just as I expected,

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,960
now Lord Chu

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
does not have to worry about it.

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Choose Miss Su.

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,000
Du Chong, come out.

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,960
She's very familiar with this movement.

92
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,240
Xiaoqiao is the only one
who can load gunpowder balls

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,240
into the musket so skillfully.

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
Yes.

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
You think so?

96
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Yeah.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
She is not Gu Qingdai.

98
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
- Du Chong.
- Not Gu Qingdai?

99
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,760
- The grave belonged to her deceased husband.
- Come out real quick.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She erected it herself.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,480
The real Gu Qingdai would not have no reaction.

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,920
So she is?

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Su Xiaoqiao.

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,160
She should have swapped faces with Gu Qingdai.

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,320
Why did Xiaoqiao swap faces with Miss Gu?

106
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,800
If this is Xiaoqiao,

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,840
then the one in the Suzheng Office must be

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Gu Qingdai.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Alright.

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
You can go back now.

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,880
Keep an eye on Gu Qingdai.

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,200
Remember,

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,480
don't let the news leak out.

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,680
- Okay.
- Go.

115
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,600
(No wonder you said before that
you lost your parents.)

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,440
(I should have recognized you then.)

117
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,700
(The Grave of Late Husband Qian Feng)

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,520
(This is the grave of Gu Qingdai's husband.)

119
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,400
(Why did Du Chong make an appointment here?)

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,200
(Could it be…)

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Lord Chu.

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
Are you okay?

123
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,240
I didn't expect Miss Gu to be
so concerned about me.

124
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
You fooled me.

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,520
Although your appearance has changed,

126
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,240
your behavior, habits, thoughts and
character cannot deceive people.

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,520
So how long are you going to
keep it from me,

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,600
Su Xiaoqiao?

129
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,440
Who's Xiaoqiao?

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm not Xiaoqiao.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
Come on,

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,200
Gu Qingdai has already told me about

133
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,000
your face swap.

134
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,870
What?

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Gu Qingdai asked me to keep the secret,

136
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,640
but she broke it first.

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,520
Xiaoqiao,

138
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,520
I knew you would come.

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
If you really care about someone,

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,320
when he is in danger,

141
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,080
you'll definitely rush to him
without hesitation.

142
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Xiaoqiao,

143
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,320
don't leave me again,

144
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,640
okay?

145
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,720
Lord Chu,

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
don't

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
be so emotional.
