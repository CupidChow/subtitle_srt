1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,560
I didn't expect

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,560
you to seek revenge in
such an extreme way.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
It's a pity that

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,840
you lost your life in vain.

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,400
Don't you want to avenge your husband?

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,520
This secret has

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,940
been hidden for long enough.

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,060
=Swap Face=

9
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,020
=Episode 20=

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
I didn't expect

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,160
(Qian Feng, Gu Qingdai's Tomb)

12
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,920
you to seek revenge in
such an extreme way.

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,840
I don't plan to die like this.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,800
I haven't had enough of
being an official yet.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,760
The face looked strange at first,

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,720
but I got used to it later.

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
I don't want to swap it.

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,000
No way.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,160
I've had enough of it.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Now that you and I have been exposed,

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,190
we'd better swap face
as soon as possible.

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,720
Then let's make a deal,

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,080
when we find the murderer,

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,600
I will swap my face with you.

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,680
In fact, you didn't consider
swapping it back, right?

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,240
I followed Gu Qingdai

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
and saw the mysterious man.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,480
It's the City Lord.

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,760
When Hua Pianpian first told me,

31
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
I didn't believe it.

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,880
The noble who protected
Lord Jia and wanted to kill me

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
is your dad.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,280
Lord Chu should have known it.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,080
No.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
You are indeed covering him up.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,280
I don't want you to be in danger.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,280
That's why I didn't tell you.

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,400
And I think there may be
another hidden story.

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
- My dad…
- Hidden story?

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
Gu Qingdai sacrificed her life.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,880
But you think there is
another hidden story.

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Lord Chu.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,640
I am getting more and more
confused about you.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,360
What you said about fairness

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,440
and justice is just ridiculous.

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't have my face back anymore.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
From today on,

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
you be the official

50
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,520
and I be the bandit.

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
(The person who wants to kill
me is the City Lord.)

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,600
(Then my mom's death must
have something to do with him.)

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,200
(Hua Pianpian chose to attack
the city at this time.)

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
(She must have known the
truth for a while.)

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
(No matter what,)

56
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
(Hua Pianpian can't attack the city.)

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,880
Leader Hua.

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,360
Miss Su, what are you doing here?

59
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,800
I want to join you.

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Join me?

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,880
I want to avenge my mom.

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
And you want to avenge your brother.

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
We have a common enemy.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Now I have drawn a clear
line with Suzheng Office,

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
and I will no longer have
anything to do with them.

66
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,040
Tribe leader, trust me.

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm good at gunpowder and
can help you attack the city.

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
So you know everything.

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
If you meet your pretty
boy in the future,

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,960
don't be reluctant to kill him.

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
We're not in the same boat.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,600
Well said.

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,440
Follow me tonight to
blow up Suzheng Office

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
to show your loyalty.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
How about that?

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
No problem.

77
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,400
(I have blown up Suzheng
Office many times.)

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,360
(It should be okay to blow up a few)

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
(unimportant places.)

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,440
(Otherwise,)

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
(Hua Pianpian will not trust me.)

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,540
(Suzheng Office)

83
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
Let me double check.

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
You…

85
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
No matter what,

86
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
you can't blow up Suzheng Office.

87
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,880
I've blown it up many

88
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,720
times before.

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,640
You're serious.

90
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
You are an official and
I am a bandit.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
We're not in the same boat.

92
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,340
(The Majesty Comes from the East)

93
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
- Who?
- Stop chasing.

94
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,620
(The brocade box is in
my hand, Mr. San)

95
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Lord Chu, you are finally here.

96
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,960
Thank you for your help earlier.

97
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
I haven't had a chance to
say thank you.

98
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,480
Hold me hostage.

99
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Mr. Du, help me.

100
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,680
You're welcome.

101
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,800
I have my purpose in saving you.

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Where's the brocade box?

103
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
Lord Chu, you are impatient.

104
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,080
This pattern is actually on the
box left by my mother.

105
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,880
This is what Xiaoqiao was
looking for.

106
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,440
As for whether to tell Miss
Su about the brocade box,

107
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,400
it is up to you.

108
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Why did you give it to me?

109
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,840
Because the time has come.

110
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,640
Time?

111
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Sorry.

112
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
More and more people have
been involved

113
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,800
because of it.

114
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,680
The more people there are,

115
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,040
the less likely this matter
will end simply.

116
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,520
Lord Chu,

117
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
open it and take a look.

118
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,880
Is this

119
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,080
my dad's jade pendant?

120
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
This face…

121
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,640
Liang Wuhui.

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,860
Liang Wuhui.

123
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,280
So

124
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,920
my dad is…

125
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,450
Greetings to Father.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,350
Dad,

127
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,800
you are hurt.

128
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,160
Yeah, during sword practice.

129
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,130
I'm good.

130
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,880
What's up?

131
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,160
I have found out that

132
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,280
the murderer of Lord Jia is
the fugitive Chen Bai.

133
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
He is now hiding in Qingfeng Village

134
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,720
and protected by Hua Pianpian.

135
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,920
It's difficult to arrest him.

136
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Hua Pianpian?

137
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Yes.

138
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
Besides,

139
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
I also inquired about something.

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,040
Go aheah.

141
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Hua Pianpian is preparing to
attack us

142
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
with several villages.

143
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,080
What?

144
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,160
Yesterday,

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,920
they blew up Suzheng Office.

146
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,480
Do you know why she did this?

147
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,080
I found out that

148
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,280
Hua Pianpian did this

149
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,880
to avenge her brother Liang Wuhui.

150
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Liang Wuhui.

151
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
For one person,

152
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,680
she actually wants to attack a city.

153
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,880
What happened yesterday
was due to my negligence.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
Please punish you.

155
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,520
Well.

156
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,000
I will take back your Chief
Badge today.

157
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
(Badge)

158
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,920
Yan,

159
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,320
if I don't punish you,

160
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,840
people in the city will say
that I am protecting you.

161
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
After this case is over,

162
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,640
I will return the Badge to you.

163
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I know.

164
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
But,

165
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,800
Hua Pianpian seems to be
coming for you this time.

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,360
Do you know the reason?

167
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
Why?

168
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,680
Nothing.

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm just curious.

170
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,120
Ridiculous.

171
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm tired. You can leave.
