1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,380
She escaped that day.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,140
It's tricky.
She is alert.

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,980
What do you mean?

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,060
I need more money.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,060
More money?

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,780
You should
be happy that

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,500
you're still alive.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,580
Then I quit.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,860
I'll give you
one more month.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,260
If she isn't dead,

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,980
you'll

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,660
be.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,220
=Swap Face=

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,180
=Episode 8=

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,220
Mrs. Gu, is it
really this hard?

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,740
Ms. Hua, I'm
afraid I can't.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,260
We're already married.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,660
Besides,

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,940
you said you
wouldn't take him back.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,940
I said?

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,100
You didn't even ask me

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,380
when you two
got married.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,620
You're still

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,220
so cute.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,940
I hate to say this,

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,900
but I miss
you so much.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,420
What?

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,780
You won't let
me touch you now?

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,060
You've forgotten
all the days we were

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,620
together?

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,860
Ms. Hua.

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,860
I'm just nobody.

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,460
You don't have to.

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,700
I don't think so.

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,820
Ms. Hua.

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,460
There are many
cute guys out there.

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,620
He is just
ordinary-looking.

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,060
How about this,

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,860
I'll give you
3 cute boys.

40
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,860
Okay?

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,100
What if I insist?

42
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,620
(What is she
really up to?)

43
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,300
(Did she)

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,500
(do this on
purpose and test us?)

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
(Should I take
a step back?)

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,660
Fine.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,540
You can take

48
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,180
him away.

49
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,300
Thank you then.

50
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,300
Let's go.

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,580
Hey.

52
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,900
Wait a moment!

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,860
What? You
want him back?

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,780
I was kidding.

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,460
Mrs. Gu, I won't
do this to you.

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,140
Funny.

57
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,140
Mrs. Gu loves
you so much.

58
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,060
There must be something

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,900
I don't know about you.

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,620
(City Lord's Mansion)

61
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,100
Have a look here.

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,340
Steamed buns!

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,940
Trinkets!

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,740
Mr. Du.

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,140
Luo Heng is in.

66
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,220
He can get help
from Suzheng Office

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,540
and enter City
Lord's Mansion freely.

68
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,500
He is probably

69
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,500
Chu Yan.

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,580
Gu Qingdai colluded
with Chu Yan.

71
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,300
She's been lying
to me all the time.

72
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,660
Then I'll just

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,220
do it the hard way.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,400
Father.

75
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,340
Did you find it?

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,620
Not yet.

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,220
Then why are you back?

78
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,780
I saw Hua
Pianpian there.

79
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,220
She seems to
know who I am

80
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,660
but didn't tell anyone.

81
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,660
I don't know why.
But I think

82
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,380
she's up to something.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay.

84
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,780
Find the box first.

85
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,220
These things don't

86
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,860
really matter now.

87
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,100
Copy that.

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,860
(Qingfeng Village Map)

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,740
(I've searched)

90
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,460
(almost everywhere.)

91
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,060
(Where is the box?)

92
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,140
(Qingfeng Village Map)
(Map?)

93
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,740
(Mr. Chu is)

94
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,460
(also trying to
find the box?)

95
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Let go of me!

96
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,460
Gu Qingdai!

97
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,300
Ru!

98
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,540
Mrs.!

99
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,540
Du Chong, what
are you doing?

100
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,460
Gu Qingdai, stop it!

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I know everything now.

102
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,500
You think you can

103
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,220
keep lying to me?

104
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,180
Marry me

105
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,940
and let me
be leader.

106
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,380
Otherwise,

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,580
I'll kill her now.

108
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,460
What makes you think

109
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,180
I'd do as you said?

110
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,260
Then I'll just..

111
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
You!

112
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,140
I can shoot you.

113
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,740
I'm serious!

114
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Kill me if you can!

115
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,780
You really
think I can't?

116
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,980
Why hasn't your

117
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,020
husband come
to save you?

118
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,100
Oh, right.

119
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,260
If he's here,

120
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,220
should I call
him Chief Chu

121
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,380
or Lord Chu?

122
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,940
What are you
talking about?

123
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
Many of our
people were

124
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,140
killed by
those constables.

125
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
If they knew

126
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,420
you colluded
with Chu Yan,

127
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,260
what do you
think they'd do?

128
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,540
What do you want?

129
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,580
Marry me

130
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,980
and let me be leader.

131
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,300
Or Chu Yan'll be dead.

132
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,980
You all will be dead.

133
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,180
Now you know
who he is.

134
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,660
If you killed him,

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,140
you'd be dead too.

136
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,460
Who do you think I am?

137
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,780
I've killed so
many people.

138
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Don't you remember?

139
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,780
You saw me
killing someone before.

140
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,780
Let me know if

141
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,140
you agree

142
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
within 3 days.

143
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,420
Or both

144
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,780
she and Chu Yan
will be dead.

145
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,500
Mr. Chu.

146
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,620
I...

147
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,180
(Someone knows
who he is now.)

148
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,300
(He has to leave.)

149
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,220
(These days,)

150
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,380
(nothing happened outside.)

151
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,460
(I got to take
action now.)
