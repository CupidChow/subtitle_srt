1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,680
Su Xiaoqiao has been
showing up for several days.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Why hasn't she died yet?

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,080
I sent a killer earlier.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,200
But people from Suzheng Office…

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,560
Your greatest use to me
is to kill Su Xiaoqiao.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,120
If you can't make it,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm afraid your life

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,670
will be in danger.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,080
(When I become the gang leader,)

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,440
(it won't be easy)

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,200
(for you to kill me.)

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,280
(If you want to kill
Su Xiaoqiao so bad,)

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,800
(why don't you do it yourself?)

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
(What are you afraid of?)

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,340
=Swap Face=

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,300
=Episode 13=

17
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,140
(Suzheng Office)

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
Suzheng Office

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,540
(Suzheng Office)

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
(I saw him passing by last night,)

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
What are you up to?

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,680
(how come he disappeared
without a trace?)

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
- (Did he escape into Suzheng Office?)
- What is she doing there?

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,560
What is she looking at?

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,080
Is there a traitor in Suzheng Office,

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,680
or is all this a conspiracy
of Suzheng Office?

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,720
She's looking up here.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Let's go, dude.

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
- Fill it up.
- Let's drink.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,520
- Come.
- Fill it up.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,760
- Come on.
- Fill it up.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
Lord, I have put all the Softening
Powder into the wedding wine.

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
Okay, proceed according to the plan.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Lord,

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,360
I feel that Hua Pianpian doesn't
look like a good person.

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
Do we have to kidnap the bride?

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Yes.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,600
We have to kidnap the bride.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Then,

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm afraid we cannot complete
the task assigned by the City Lord.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
I'll figure it out later.

42
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,880
Anyways,

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,880
I can't let Miss Gu marry that scumbag.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,200
Indeed, love can easily
make people crazy.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
Come on.

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,440
This wine is a bit strong.
It's so hot.

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,880
This wine is so strong.

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Dizzy.

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
Lord Chu.

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
It's been a while.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,960
Where have you been these days?

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Cut the crap.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,040
Hand over Gu Qingdai.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
You guys probably don't
know him.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,400
The handsome husband-in-law
in front of me

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
is a big shot.

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,360
He is the Chief of Suzheng Office

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,400
and the Young Lord of
Yunjiang City, Chu Yan.

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,280
Our gang leader Gu was
kept in the dark by him before.

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Later, he learned who this guy is.

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
She was lucky to remarry me.

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Today is my big day.

63
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,000
Kill him for me to celebrate.

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Go.

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
Since you know that I have other purposes
for staying in Qingfeng Village.

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,440
Of course I won't act rashly.

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
The prison of Suzheng Office
is heavily guarded.

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,080
If Chu Yan knew that I
brought you in,

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,670
I would definitely be exposed.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,720
I have a solution.

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,360
What's that?

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,640
I knew he would come.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,520
(Lord Chu actually came to save me.)

74
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
Are you sure?

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,680
How can you conclude that he
will come to kidnap the bride?

76
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
What if he doesn't come?

77
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
He'll come, I swear.

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Gu Qingdai.

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Are you okay?

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
Qingdai.

81
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,520
Lord Chu,

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm afraid you can't
go nowhere today.

83
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
Mr. Du, help.

84
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,240
Mr. Du, follow him.

85
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,960
If you want to know the
whereabouts of your brother,

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
just go ask him,

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
but you can't take him away.

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
Deal.

89
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,700
(Suzheng Office)

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,840
You don't have to come to
see me so often.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,200
The person I least want to see is you.

92
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,400
We are friends, don't be so heartless.

93
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,400
Heartless?

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
You mean you?

95
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,480
You still don't want to see me
without the mask.

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
What a hypocritical man.

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Hypocritical?

98
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,480
Chen Bai, think about it.

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
If I were heartless,

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
would you still be alive today?

101
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
The person you're looking for
is right here.

102
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,160
I have done what I promised you.

103
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Alright.

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
Go look out for me.

105
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,480
Uncle Chen.

106
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
Uncle Chen, Uncle Chen.

107
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
- Pianpian.
- After you took my brother away,

108
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
where did he go?

109
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
Where is my brother, Uncle Chen?

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,080
- Pianpian.
- Uncle Chen.

111
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,680
Your brother…

112
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,240
Uncle Chen.
