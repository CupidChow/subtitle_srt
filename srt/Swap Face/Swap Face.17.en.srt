1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Who are you?

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,040
How dare you trespass into Suzheng Office?

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,920
Don't panic.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,520
I won't hurt you.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,400
Tomorrow you will be impersonating me.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,960
I am Gu Qingdai.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,120
You are Miss Gu?

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,040
Have a seat.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,640
Back then, your mother, the
Medicine Girl, was killed by her enemy,

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,040
and the murderer took away your
mother's brocade box.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,800
It's been many years.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,920
You've been looking for the
murderer's whereabouts, right?

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,720
How do you know this?

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,680
I know where the brocade box is.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,600
But you have to agree to one condition.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,880
What is it?

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,920
Swap face with me.

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,060
=Swap Face=

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,020
=Episode 17=

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,150
Greetings to Father.

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,680
Gu Qingdai has not been heard from

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
since she escaped from prison.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,400
Yan,

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,520
you didn't hide her, did you?

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,120
Father, you have wronged me.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,280
I have posted notices all over
Yunjiang City.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,440
The reward is five hundred liang.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,160
No clues yet.

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,480
I know

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
you are into her.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
But she carries too many secrets.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
I am worried that she will harm you.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Dad, don't worry.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,520
I believe that Gu Qingdai is
not a bad person.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
We must be fair.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
I came here because I have
something to ask you.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,720
About the brocade box.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,400
You said earlier that the brocade box
was in Qingfeng Village.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Is this news reliable?

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,480
Why?

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,960
I've been searching for several days.

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
But there is no trace of the brocade box.

43
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,160
So,

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,040
I want to confirm with you.

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,760
Well, I'll tell you about it.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,960
The brocade box was stolen by the
people from Qingfeng Village,

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,960
so it can only be there.

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,920
I see.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,040
Yan,

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
the brocade box matters a lot.

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,360
I have prepared for the worst.

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,480
As a last resort,

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,800
we can only capture Qingfeng Village.

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,280
Dad, no worries.

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,240
I'll try to find

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
the brocade box as soon as possible

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
and destroy it.

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Go ahead.

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,380
(Wanted)

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,520
Lord Chu,

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
who…

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
who drew this?

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
Me.

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Is it good?

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,640
(WANTED)
You drew it?

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah.

67
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,680
Am I that ugly?

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
You…

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,680
This is not your face,

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
it's Gu Qingdai's face.

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,600
But now I'm wearing this face.

72
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,600
You painted me way too ugly.

73
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,400
If it looked like you,

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
wouldn't you be recognized immediately?

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,080
Stupid.

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,440
You're right.

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,520
I don't want to be wanted anymore.

78
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
(Crow pattern.)

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,480
(Xiaoqiao is also looking for
the brocade box.)

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Xiaoqiao,

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,160
did you draw this?

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Yes.

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
The pattern on this brocade box
is unique.

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,040
This pattern is actually on the
box left by my mother.

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
She was killed because of this box.

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
So as long as we find this box,

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
we can find the murderer.

88
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
(Isn't the thing in the brocade box)

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,320
(the alliance letter of the five
major villages?)

90
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,080
(How could it be the relic of
Xiaoqiao's mother?)

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,480
(Is the information wrong?)

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,120
(Xiaoqiao was assassinated several times)

93
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,440
(because of the brocade box?)

94
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,080
(What secret is hidden in it?)

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
(Who wants to get it?)

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,040
- (Anyways,)
- Lord Chu.

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,880
(Xiaoqiao's face-swapping can't be exposed.)

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
What are you thinking about?

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
Nothing.

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
Lord Chu,

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,720
you sneaked into Qingfeng Village before.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,840
Were you looking for the brocade box?

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,720
No, I'm not.

104
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
I told you that

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
I was collecting evidence.

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
All right.

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Do your thing.

108
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,600
Do your thing.

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,080
Can you

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
please not look at me so temptingly?

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,580
Why?

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,360
Lord Chu is shy?

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,720
I will…

114
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,560
I will kiss you.

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
Lord Chu.

116
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,110
Excuse me.

117
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,880
Wait a minute.

118
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,440
Come here.

119
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
What's up?

120
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
Go ahead.

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
Lord Jia was killed last night.

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
What?

123
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,080
Master Jia was killed?

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,230
Died on the spot.

125
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,960
The murderer is a martial arts master

126
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
with decent sword skills.

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,080
Lord Jia was in charge of my
mother's case back then.

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
He was killed at this time,

129
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
what a coincidence.

130
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
I always feel that it is related
to my mother's death.

131
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Look at this piece of cloth,

132
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
it should have been torn off
the murderer.

133
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,880
There must be various

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
connections between this series of cases.

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Lord Chu, I'm coming.

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,440
Lord Jia is dead.

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
Lord Jia?

138
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
The person behind the scenes
has already set up the trap,

139
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
waiting for us to take the bait.

140
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,480
What do you mean, Lord Chu?

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,760
I already know that you

142
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,210
and Xiaoqiao have swapped faces.

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,690
Why did you

144
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,600
enter Suzheng Office as Su Xiaoqiao?

145
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,720
Don't you want to avenge your husband?

146
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,400
(It seems that I can't stay in
Suzheng Office anymore.)

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,440
What if I say

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
I have nothing to say?

149
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Miss Gu,

150
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
you can't go far alone.

151
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,760
The murderer behind these
cases may be the same person.

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,920
I was bound by my family before.

153
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,080
It wasn't until I met him

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,360
that I truly lived for myself.

155
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,640
Please forgive me.

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,040
I want to avenge him in person.

157
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Done.

158
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,950
Thank you.

159
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,680
Have a good rest.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
Take this.

161
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Aunt Wang, I won't charge you.

162
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,200
I can't do that. Take it.

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,520
Use it to buy some nutritious food.

164
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,440
Well, thank you.

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
(Mom, don't worry.)

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,320
(I will find out the truth)

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
(and prove your innocence.)

168
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,320
Thinking about your mom?

169
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
Night snack.

170
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,160
Thank you.

171
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,080
Do you remember

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,040
what I said to you when you

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,690
first entered Suzheng Office?

174
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,280
Lord, I'm new here.

175
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
I'm Su Xiaoqiao.

176
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,520
The right and wrong of the matter
will be judged by the public.

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,080
But in order to uphold justice,

178
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,280
it takes patience and perseverance

179
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,480
to find out the truth behind the case.

180
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
Since you have chosen Suzheng Office,

181
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,720
you should stick to your heart
and be down-to-earth.

182
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
When you officially join us,

183
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,020
(Qingyun)
I'll give you the Qingyun Badge.

184
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,200
Okay, I will, Lord Chu.

185
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
Will you help me?

186
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,480
Of course.

187
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,280
Even if it's someone else,

188
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,600
I will do the same thing.

189
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,000
Plus, it's related to your mom.

190
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,920
Thank you on behalf of my mom.

191
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,920
By the way,

192
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
Lord Jia was killed right after

193
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,600
Hua Pianpian rescued Chen Bai.

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
These two events are probably related.

195
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,440
I think all this was planned
by Hua Pianpian.

196
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,280
You have to ask them in person
about these things.

197
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,160
Let's go then.

198
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,760
Let's go?

199
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,840
Just stay here.

200
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
You are now a wanted criminal.

201
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,160
Lord Chu,

202
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
you said that a constable

203
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,800
should stick to his heart.

204
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I have been out of prison for days.

205
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,160
I don't care.

206
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,800
I will go whatsoever.

207
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,440
No, you won't.

208
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,880
Believe me.

209
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,080
I have your protection, no one
dares to mess with me.

210
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,760
Leader, I've figured it out.

211
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,080
Su Xiaoqiao's mother

212
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
is the Medicine Lady.

213
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,120
No wonder they want to kill her.

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,430
If the root of the problem is not
removed, there will be endless troubles.
