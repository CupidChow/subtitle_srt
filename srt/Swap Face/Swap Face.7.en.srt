00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,380
Chu Yan, Chief
of Suzheng Office,

2
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,900
is, Jiang City
Lord, Chu Feng's son.

3
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,580
He is cute and skilled
in martial arts.

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,220
It's said he's
sick lately

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,060
and isn't on duty.

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,380
It's him!

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,580
Even Chu Yan
is involved.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,420
Interesting.

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,660
=Swap Face=

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,620
=Episode 7=

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,310
You're still so cute.

12
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,190
What a pity.

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,150
Since Mrs. Gu
loves you so much,

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,190
I won't take you back.

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,470
You can stay here.

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,910
Ms. Hua.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,350
It's a really
nice place here.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,780
I'd like to
stay for a while.

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,350
Mrs. Gu,

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,970
is that alright?

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,270
Absolutely. You can

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,830
live as long
as you want.

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,790
Honey.

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,830
Honey.

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,390
Liu's such a jerk!

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,150
How dare he
take the girls away?

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,190
We can't just
let him off.

28
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,590
- Right?
- Yes.

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,470
Peng is such
a jerk!

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,990
How dare he do that?

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,270
Let's teach
him a lesson.

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,590
- Ready?
- Yes.

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,430
Let's go!

34
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,390
Peng!

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,950
You jerk!

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,430
Come out here!

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,640
You're dead today!

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,810
Liu!

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,150
I'll kill you today!

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
Go!

41
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,270
Go!

42
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,550
Help yourself.

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,220
Chief, they're
fighting there.

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,550
Is it okay that we're

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
here and eat?

46
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,830
You have a point.

47
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,270
Hey.

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,510
You think we should

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
move closer?

50
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,830
No.

51
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,720
That'd be too close.

52
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,580
Here is the best.

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,870
Hmm, you're right.

54
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,390
What a well-matched

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,510
couple!

56
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,430
Just eat it.

57
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,710
I'll kill you!

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,310
You're dead!

59
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,200
I'll kill you!

60
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,990
- I'll kill you!
- You're dead!

61
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,860
- I'll kill you!
- You're dead!

62
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,350
I'll kill you!

63
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,190
You're dead!

64
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:50,550
I'll kill you!

65
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,510
I'll kill you!

66
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,070
Catch them!

67
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,050
I guess we've
been tricked.

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
Chief.

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,860
Peng and Liu's gang
are all arrested.

70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,870
We saved the
girls they kept and

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,330
seized these jewelries.

72
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,900
(I helped a
lot this time.)

73
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,110
(I can totally
pass the test.)

74
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,040
(But I'm Gu Qingdai.
I can say)

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,210
(nothing about this.)

76
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,150
What a pity!

77
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,830
Xiaoqiao isn't
on this case.

78
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,870
Or she'd definitely
pass the test.

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,380
Why are you keep
talking about Xiaoqiao?

80
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,780
You forget I
am your wife?

81
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,460
What? You want me

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,500
to be your
real husband?

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,180
Absolutely no.

84
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,860
I'm just curious

85
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,180
why you care
so much about her.

86
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,740
Are...

87
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,460
Are you two...

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,860
It's none of
your business.

89
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,180
Chief, I'll take
these back now.

90
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,660
You two!

91
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Hey. Hold on.

92
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,060
Mr. Chu,

93
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,050
I helped you
a lot this time.

94
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,820
Shouldn't I

95
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,140
get something
as a reward?

96
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,940
These are all
precious jewelries.

97
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,940
I've told you.

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,100
We can't make a
fortune by robbing.

99
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,340
It's important
to use some tricks.

100
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Here. Look at these.

101
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
Mrs. Gu, thank
you so much!

102
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,380
It's been so long

103
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,580
since we last saw
so much jewelries.

104
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

105
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,260
We've always

106
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,460
lived on a
tight budget.

107
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,260
We eat bread and
pickles every day.

108
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,040
I can't even
taste sweet now.

109
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,180
So now you know,

110
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,060
the leader is

111
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,140
very important.

112
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,220
Once you're misled,

113
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,460
you'll live
a rough life.

114
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,860
Mrs. Gu. From now on,

115
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
you're my

116
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,820
one and only leader.

117
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,140
I'll do just
as you say.

118
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Guys, what we
believe most is...

119
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,660
Fairness! Fairness!
And Fairness!

120
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,580
Sir. You can give

121
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
these out now.

122
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,180
Okay. Okay.

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,580
Mrs. Gu, take care.

124
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,180
It is good.

125
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,860
Now everyone here

126
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,370
will follow
your orders.

127
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,700
Will you?

128
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,300
I am the Chief,
you are a gangster.

129
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
What do you think?

130
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,940
I think you should.

131
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,140
Or others

132
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,740
would find out.

133
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,180
Come here.

134
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,420
I'm thirsty.

135
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,020
Peel this for me.

136
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,300
Open your mouth.

137
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,500
Mr. Du.

138
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,590
I've taken

139
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,900
her here.

140
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,180
Let go of me.

141
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,060
- Speak up!
- Let me go!

142
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,860
- Louder!
- Help!

143
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,580
- Help!
- Louder!

144
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,780
Let go of me!

145
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,020
Please! Help!

146
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,860
Stop!

147
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,700
You jerk!

148
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,540
Stay away from her!

149
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,500
What?

150
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,460
Are you jealous

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,270
of her?

152
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,660
What do you
think you're doing?

153
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
You are powerful.

154
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,300
But you can't do this.

155
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,700
This?

156
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,340
Then what about
you forced him

157
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,060
to marry you?

158
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,620
I learned this
from you.

159
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,340
Consent is a really

160
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,410
important part
of these things.

161
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,180
I offered to be
together with Mrs. Gu.

162
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,100
But she doesn't.

163
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,380
They took me here

164
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,840
just after
you saved me.

165
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,420
Mrs. Gu,
please help me!

166
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
Offered?

167
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,780
You sure did.

168
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,260
You colluded
with others

169
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,180
and sabotaged
our business.

170
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,660
I'm not an idiot.

171
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,100
I know what you did.

172
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Don't you

173
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,860
ever do this again.

174
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,500
Thanks, Mr. Du.

175
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,500
But I think you

176
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,380
shouldn't too.

177
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,660
There's so much
fun here.

178
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,900
You two are

179
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,580
fighting because
of a girl?!

180
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,020
Since when are
you so jealous?

181
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,500
She seems nice.

182
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,300
And I need
a maid here.

183
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,300
Mr. Du, can you give

184
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,980
her to me?

185
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,780
Ms. Hua.

186
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,820
I don't think you
should do this.

187
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,060
It's just a girl.

188
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,620
What?

189
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,820
Are you saying
no to me now?

190
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,980
Fine, Ms. Hua,

191
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,380
she is yours.

192
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,940
How come you never
did this to me?

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,340
I didn't know you love

194
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,180
Mrs. Gu so much.

195
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
I changed my mind.

196
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,820
Can you

197
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,580
give him back to me?
