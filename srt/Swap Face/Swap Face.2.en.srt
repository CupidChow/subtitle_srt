00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,940
I'm so beautiful.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,380
Take care of my face.

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,180
Remember

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,020
to keep your promise.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,380
I've prepared everything for you.

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,100
You'll be leader there.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,870
The winner can marry her.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,070
Then everyone here can compete with you.

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,150
Mr. Du is right.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,550
Guys.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,470
Get ready to show yourself.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,310
Go!

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,550
Beat him!

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,110
- My arm!
- My feet!

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,950
Take this.

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,870
You're good with guns?

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,990
Kill me now,

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,920
or I'll marry

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,080
Gu Qingdai today.

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,590
If you two are sure about this,

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,350
how about take a gamble?

24
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,590
There is only one bullet.

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,590
Who goes first?

26
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,590
So you lost.

27
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,890
Yes.

28
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,950
Yes.

29
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,590
Everyone!

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,590
Mr. Luo

31
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,190
won it fair and square.

32
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,550
He'll be my husband.

33
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,790
(No one can beat Chief)

34
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,590
(in this game.)

35
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,000
Ah. Mr. Gu!

36
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,550
He won it fairly.

37
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,070
Mr. Gu.

38
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,470
(Chief is so good.)

39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,510
(Why did she ask me do this?)

40
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,980
(1 hour ago)

41
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,950
I'm here

42
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,590
to announce that

43
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,550
I'll marry Gu Qingdai today.

44
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,230
And we'll spend the rest of

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,310
our life together.

46
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,750
I also want to annouce that

47
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,270
no matter what happened,

48
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,830
I wouldn't marry you.

49
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,750
Gu Qingdai!

50
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,630
What's wrong with you?

51
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,670
Look.

52
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,750
Feng Ring?

53
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,950
My late husband, your previous

54
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,470
leader, Qian Feng, left this letter.

55
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,430
He passed his crown to me.

56
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,670
From now on,

57
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,910
I am the leader of Qingfeng Gang.

58
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,910
It's impossible!

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,430
Qian Feng didn't

60
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,750
leave any letter.

61
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,110
How can you be sure

62
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,070
about this?

63
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,500
(Last Words)

64
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,950
Give me that.

65
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,710
Guys.

66
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,510
Mr. Qian wrote this!

67
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,910
No one can write

68
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,590
like this except for him.

69
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,910
But the gang leader

70
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,550
is obliged to get married.

71
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,750
That's right.

72
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,110
So today I'll marry

73
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,830
him.

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,390
Who is he?

75
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,310
Who is he?

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,710
Yeah, who is he?

77
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,030
He looks cute.

78
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,870
Yes.

79
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,430
You're

80
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,710
not one of us.

81
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,910
I work for

82
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,910
Hua Pianpian, the leader of Wuzhai Tribe.

83
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,550
I'm Luo Heng.

84
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,150
I'm here for the wedding today.

85
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,630
Unexpectedly,

86
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,950
Miss Gu and I fell in love.

87
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,630
Mrs. Hua gave this silk bag to me.

88
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,350
Yes, it's from Hua Pianpian.

89
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,150
He is a gigolo!

90
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,590
Gigolo.

91
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,070
Gigolo. Go home!

92
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,350
Shame on you.

93
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,030
You've been away for a while.

94
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,070
And you just came back.

95
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,910
I'm afraid you

96
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,390
can't be in charge right away.

97
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,430
How about this?

98
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,910
I'll

99
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,110
marry you.

100
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,710
And we'll be in charge together.

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,990
What do you think?

102
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,070
(He is so shameless.)

103
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,870
Ah. How about this,

104
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,790
we can have

105
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,150
a martial arts contest.

106
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,280
If you can beat Mr. Luo,

107
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,190
I'll marry you.

108
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
Okay?

109
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,270
(Why did she do that?)

110
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,660
(Wedding)

111
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,030
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

112
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,990
Miss Gu, are you sure about this?

113
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,150
Bow to Lord Guan!

114
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,670
You agreed to help me.

115
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,470
Just follow along.

116
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,070
Bow to each other!

117
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,710
Done! Go to have your wedding night!

118
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,470
Can you tell me now?

119
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,990
Where is Su Xiaoqiao?

120
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,670
We haven't done the love shot.

121
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,510
What's the hurry?

122
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,070
I've done as you said.

123
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,270
Tell me,

124
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,870
where is Su Xiaoqiao?

125
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,800
(Now you care about me?)

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,580
(Then why did you fail me?)

127
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,790
Who is Miss Su?

128
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,710
Does she mean a lot to you?

129
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,510
Hey! You!

130
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,200
Tell me. Right now.

131
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,190
Alright, alright.

132
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,910
Actually, I don't know where she is.

133
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,230
But I'm sure that

134
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,470
she is safe now.

135
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,910
Don't worry.

136
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,210
Why is it so quiet
on the wedding night?

137
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,350
Honey, this is our wedding night.

138
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,270
Let's do this right now.
