00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,100
(Three months ago)

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,520
(I gave up everything to elope with you,)

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,440
(and we promised to grow old together,)

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,760
(but now you have left me alone.)

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
Who's that?

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Don't you want to avenge your husband?

7
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,300
(Su Xiaoqiao)

8
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,100
=Swap Face=

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,060
=Episode 16=

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
Su Xiaoqiao.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,560
The mysterious man.

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,000
What's the connection between the two?

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Crap.

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
We are exposed, retreat.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,800
Lord, the assassins of Qingfeng Village
have been repulsed.

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,040
Gu Qingdai is safe.

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
Okay, I got it.

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Lord Chu,

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,960
did you catch the assassins?

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
They escaped.

21
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Where's Gu Qingdai?

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Are you hurt?

23
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
Xiaoqiao,

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,760
I don't want you to be in danger,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,040
so you have to tell me everything.

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,080
Why did you and Gu Qingdai swap faces?

27
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,560
Actually,

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
I sneaked into Qingfeng Village

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,280
to find out the truth about
my mother's murder.

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
What about Gu Qingdai?

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,920
Her husband Qian Feng died at
the hands of Du Chong.

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,920
But she said

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,600
there might be a real culprit behind this.

34
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Du Chong.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
It's him again.

36
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,800
The one who was sent to kill Gu Qingdai

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,360
was actually sent to kill you.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,840
It seems that

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
the real culprit is likely

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,000
to be the same group of people
or the same person.

41
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,200
Did that person want to kill me
because of my mother?

42
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,180
Oh no.

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
I'd better go back to Qingfeng Village
and be an undercover agent.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
Only by finding the brocade box

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
can the real culprit be caught.

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,360
It's night now,

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,560
where are you going to catch him?

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I

49
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
haven't decided yet.

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Qingfeng Village is in danger these days.

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,720
Even if you want to go back,
I will go with you.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
No.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
I'd better go back to the cell
as soon as possible.

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble
if I'm found out.

55
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,200
What are you doing?

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,760
Put me down.

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,470
You're not allowed to go anywhere tonight.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,640
- Just sleep here.
- No.

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
Put me down.

60
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
This bed can't even be lifted.

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,960
You don't have to.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,160
It's all good.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Put me down, please.

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
Hurry.

65
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
Isn't this my wooden musket?

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,920
Why is it here with you?

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,280
Can you please stop taking
my things randomly?

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,600
This wooden musket is very important to me.

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
It's yours?

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,080
Very important?

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,680
I gave it to you when you were a child.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
Now that you've grown up,

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
if you lose it,

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,440
I can make another one for you.

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
You can't be the one who…

77
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,080
I recognized you

78
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,800
the first time I saw you.

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,990
Don't you also have something
to hide from me?

81
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,800
Because I…

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,920
Lord Chu has been quite busy recently.

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,960
He didn't complete any of

84
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
the things you asked him to do,

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,320
but he was quite active in other things.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
City Lord,

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,800
you have to discipline Lord Chu.

88
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,160
Lord Jia,

89
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,600
I can see that

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
he has fallen in love with that woman.

91
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
May I ask Lord Jia

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,960
to help me find out

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,280
what that woman is plotting?

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
If she's not a good person,

95
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
kill her.

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Yes,

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,120
City Lord.

98
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,100
(Liang Wuhui, Qingfeng Village)
So you came to

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Qingfeng Village just because of this note?

100
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,560
Did you find any information
in Qingfeng Village?

102
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,080
I only found out that the daughter of
the Medicine Lady swapped faces

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,720
with someone else.

104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,800
Swap faces?

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Does Uncle Chen know about it?

106
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
Be patient.

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
I need to confirm one more thing.

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
I will tell you

109
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,720
after I confirm it.

110
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
So my brother's death is related
to the Medicine Lady?

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,880
The Medicine Lady is not the murderer.

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
The real murderer is…

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,160
What?

114
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,880
Greetings to the leader.

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
Brothers of Qingfeng Village,

116
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
I have found out that

117
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,320
the former gang leader Gu Qingdai

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,840
colluded with Suzheng Office to
disintegrate Qingfeng Village.

119
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,000
Thanks to Mr. Du's

120
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,520
timely discovery, it did not
cause a disaster.

121
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,080
I declare that

122
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
from today on,

123
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,960
Du Chong

124
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,320
is the new gang leader of Qingfeng Village.

125
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Thank you, leader.

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,440
I'll give you the Feng Ring that
symbolizes the identity

127
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,840
of the gang leader.

128
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Don't forget our agreement.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Greetings to the gang leader.

130
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,280
The dead of night

131
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,080
is a good time to kill people.

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
(Brother,)

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,640
(don't worry,)

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,280
(Pianpian will not let you die in vain.)

135
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,760
Lord Chu.

136
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Lord Chu.

137
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,160
(I'd better go back to the cell.)

138
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,320
(Otherwise, Lord Chu will be
implicated by me again.)

139
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,040
It's early in the morning.

140
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,920
Where are you going?

141
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,400
You're awake.

142
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,080
I'm going back to the cell.

143
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,320
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

144
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,880
You won't.

145
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
You're

146
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,520
out of prison.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
You…

148
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,280
How did you get in?

149
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Help, help.

150
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,680
Stop shouting.

151
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,680
They are all dead.

152
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,880
Don't, don't, don't…

153
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't kill me, don't kill me, please.

154
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,240
You have to pay the price.
