1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,800
Are you ready?

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,880
Let's begin.

3
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,620
=Swap Face=

4
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,580
=Episode 12=

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,120
Miss Xiaoqiao, no need to refuse yet.

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,680
I know exactly how capable you are.

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,640
I know it very well.

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,600
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
I don't understand.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,240
I not only know your true identity,

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,760
I also know your mother
mastered an exclusive secret technique.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
Face-changing.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,640
But rest assured,

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,560
if I wanted to expose you,

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
you wouldn't be here today.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,680
For the Alliance Leader
to go through such trouble,

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,480
this person must be extraordinary.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,040
Just a petty thief,

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,720
whether one more or less doesn't matter.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,400
To be honest,

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
this person is my brother's master,

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,600
and also my Uncle Bai.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,080
So if you help me save him,

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
I promise to keep your secret.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,160
(If you don't help her,)

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,960
(she's unlikely to let it go.)

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
(Revealing my identity would be troublesome.)

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,640
The Justice Pavilion prison cell
is heavily guarded.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,600
This matter requires careful planning.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Three days.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
I won't be patient for long.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
Miss Su.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Oh.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,560
Chief Gu, you should reconsider.

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,860
(Wind blowing)

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,000
Who let you in here?

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,760
I specially had a new wedding dress made.

38
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
Brought it for Madam to try on.

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
See if it fits well.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Let's keep the wedding simple.

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,600
We're just going through the motions.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
How can a wedding be so simple?

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,520
I just want to show you my feelings.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
So?

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Do you like it?

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,120
The fabric is indeed nice.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,840
It could be tailored into a few.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,080
Cleaning cloths.

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Come here.

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
Xiao Ru.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Miss,

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
the Madam hasn't had care lately,

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,240
she must be unaccustomed.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,640
I've arranged for Xiao Ru to return,

55
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
to attend to the Madam.

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,560
- You.
- Take good care of the Madam,

57
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
if anything happens,

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,840
you know the consequences.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
Ensure the Madam is well attended,

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
and never leave her side.

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,560
Madam,

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
I must take my leave now.

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,400
- Miss.
- Come.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,040
Are you hurt?

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,920
No, I'm not.

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
How do you feel?

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,640
Second Chief.

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
In this wedding attire,

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,080
you look truly elegant and handsome,

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,960
just like Pan An.

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,400
What did you just call me?

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Village Chief.

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
Village Chief.

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
When you wear this wedding attire,

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,000
it would be a double blessing.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
Well said.

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Village Chief,

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,160
forgive my boldness,

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,920
but why insist on marrying Gu Qingdai?

80
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
That girl is full of tricks.

81
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,000
You can't guard against everything.

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
In my opinion,

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,400
once you seize the Village Chief's position,

84
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,640
we'll give her to you.

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,160
Gu Qingdai is someone I must have.

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
However,

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,680
you've never experienced love
between a man and a woman,

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,030
so it's normal not to understand.

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,120
That Gu Qingdai girl,

90
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,000
once took the initiative to approach me.

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Later, she seemed like a different person.

92
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
She shut me out completely.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,200
The more she acted this way,

94
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,120
the more I wanted to win her over.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,920
Her tactic of playing hard to get,

96
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,520
was truly skillful.

97
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,200
What insights do you all have?

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Ah, like this,

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
let's hear from the back first.

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,720
And so on and so forth.

101
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
Meeting adjourned.

102
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,200
Sometimes playful,

103
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,240
sometimes assertive.

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,240
You...

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,280
This is the fourth time
you've aimed a Firearm at me.

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,080
If it comes to a fight,
I might not lose to you.

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,920
What I love most,

108
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,560
is her mysterious expression.

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,440
I heard the second in command
is looking for me.

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,560
I'll take my leave then.

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
Thanks to the Alliance Leader's care,

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,640
I'm finally about to become Village Chief.

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,680
However, I've heard

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Chief Gu has been quite close
to the Alliance Leader lately.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,000
Whom I get close to is my choice.

116
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
What,

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,960
not even Village Chief yet
and teaching me how to act?

118
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,440
If you become Village Chief,

119
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,800
will you disregard me, the Alliance Leader?

120
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
I wouldn't dare.

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,680
Gu Qingdai will soon be my Madam.

122
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,360
I hope the Alliance Leader supports me.

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,760
I always side with the advantageous.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,080
So Chief Du, you can rest easy.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,840
Thank you, Alliance Leader.

126
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,600
Rest assured.

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,640
There'll be benefits for you after.

128
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
However,

129
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
don't celebrate too soon, Chief Du.

130
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
You're forcing Gu Qingdai to marry.

131
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,280
Some people just can't stay calm.

132
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,840
As for me,

133
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
I just want to remind you.

134
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Continue trying on the wedding gown.

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,040
(Du Chong was already on guard.)

136
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,920
(This place is heavily guarded.)

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
(It's best to be cautious.)

138
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,880
(That Brocade Box.)

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
Sir, the Soft Bone Powder was stolen.

140
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
This Third Master is a seasoned trickster.

141
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
You truly have all sorts of tricks.

142
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,280
Criticizing others for deceit.

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,920
But your Justice Pavilion's methods

144
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,960
aren't much better.

145
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Sir, she...

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,080
You two make quite an enviable couple.

147
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,520
Don't worry,

148
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,560
I didn't hear anything.
