(In folklore, there exists a magic)

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,940
(that can swap two people's faces.)

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,860
(Once done, no one can find out.)

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,980
(From now on,)

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,500
(I am the gangster.)

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,900
(You are the officer.)

=Episode 1=

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,500
(I gave up everything and married you.)

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,180
(Gu Qingdai, Wife of Qingfeng Gang Leader)
(You promised we'd never be apart,)

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,860
(but now you
left me forever.)

12
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,620
Who is it?

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,420
Don't you want to
avenge your husband?

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,740
(Su Xiaoqiao)

15
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,980
What's that?

16
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,500
What's that smell?

17
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,380
It's an ambush.

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,220
Shen Su!

19
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,380
Chief!

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,140
(Chu Yan, Chief of Suzheng Office)

21
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,980
(Oh no!)

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,260
(Where am I?)

23
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,580
(The bridal chamber?)

24
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,740
(Wasn't I just...)

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,660
(Is it...)

26
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,420
(Qingfeng Village!)

27
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,940
Miss, why are you here?

28
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,380
Hey! Miss.
It's not time yet.

29
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,220
Where are you
going, Miss?

30
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,220
It's not time for the wedding.

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,580
Miss.

32
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,550
Miss! I can't keep up with you, Miss.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,660
Where are you going, honey?

34
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,740
What are you saying?

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,620
Gu Qingdai!

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,100
(Du Chong, Qingfeng Gang's new chief)
Accept it! You have to marry me today!

37
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
What did you call me?

38
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,020
(Miss Gu!)

39
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,700
Are you ready?

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,940
Go ahead.

41
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,620
You made a deal with me.

42
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,860
If anyone knew anything about this,

43
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,340
I'd cut your face.

44
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,380
And you can never be you anymore.

45
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,700
(Right.)

46
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,860
(I am Gu Qingdai now.)

47
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,100
(The day before)

48
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,460
(I'm Su Xiaoqiao,)

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,060
(a pretty, talented and smart)

50
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,900
(new constable.)

51
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,250
(Su Xiaoqiao, Constable of Suzheng Office)

52
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,540
(Every day at work, I play with fire,)

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,740
(uh, no,)

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,580
(work on the firearms.)

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,180
It smells so good.

56
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,300
(As the saying goes,)

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,220
(eating chicken helps a lot at work.)

58
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,820
Chief, what brings you here?

59
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,420
We'll fight Qingfeng Gang soon.

60
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,980
What about the weapons I asked?

61
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,620
I still need some time.

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,580
More time?

63
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,820
Are you sure

64
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,660
you didn't slack off at work?

65
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
No, Chief.

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,900
Chief, I swear,

67
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,740
if I ever did that, I'd...

68
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Be careful!

69
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,860
Sir,

70
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,860
can I pass the test this time?

71
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,340
Sir, look.

72
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,500
My dream is to become an officer.

73
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,220
That's my motto.

74
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,100
(My dream is to become an officer.)
I'd rather die than live without it.

75
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,780
Chief, the Gu family reported that

76
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,260
the Qingfeng Gang threatened to take

77
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,740
Miss Gu away at her wedding tomorrow.

78
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,260
What?

79
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,540
Ridiculous!
These jerks!

80
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,780
How can they do this?

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,860
Chief,

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,420
we have to teach them a lesson.

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,140
Shen Su.

84
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,100
(Shen Su, Constable of Suzheng Office)
Tell other people, we'll split up.

85
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,740
Some pretend to be the servants.

86
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,860
Others follow along secretly.

87
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,580
So they can be caught unguarded.

88
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,420
Should someone pretend to be Miss Gu?

89
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,700
Mrs.

90
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,980
(Chief?)

91
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,220
(Why is he here?)

92
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,700
You are

93
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,180
Miss Gu?

94
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,220
Hmm.

95
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,580
I am Chu Yan,
Chief of Suzheng Office.

96
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,180
Mr. Chu, what can I do for you?

97
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,580
Give me that.

98
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,300
Mrs.

99
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,900
Where did you get this gun?

100
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,500
(I can't tell him who I am now.)

101
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,980
Mr. Chu, are you here to save me?

102
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,820
Miss Gu, have you seen

103
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,500
a girl who looks like you here?

104
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,220
This is her gun.

105
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,540
(He cares so much about me.)

106
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Hey! You guys! Check over there!

107
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,540
Okay.

108
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,060
(Chief is skilled in martial arts.)

109
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,340
(If he helped me,)

110
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,380
(I'd have a better chance to make it.)

111
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,340
Mr. Chu,

112
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,860
I know where the gun owner is.

113
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,700
Help me out.

114
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,140
I'll tell you afterwards.
