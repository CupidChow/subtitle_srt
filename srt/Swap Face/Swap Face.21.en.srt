Qingfeng Gang!

Mom!

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,300
Mom!

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,800
Mom!

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,000
Mom!

(Feng)

10
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,240
Tribe Leader, can I talk to you now?

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,680
What?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,240
You blew up Suzheng Office yesterday.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,080
What's your plan today?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,320
Nothing.

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,560
I just want to show you something.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
Do you know what this is?

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,240
This?

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,720
Where did you get it?

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,240
It was found among
Lord Jia's belongings.

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
Sir, have a look here.

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,870
Steamed buns! Sir!

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,630
Trinkets!

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,770
Trinkets!

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,050
Delicious food!

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Does it hurt?

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,480
No.

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Not at all.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,560
You know what this is?

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
Miss Su, just tell me what

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,680
you want to know about.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,080
You're so cunning.

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,740
You tricked both

33
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,780
me and Hua Pianpian.

34
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,700
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,220
Okay then.

36
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,420
Current City Lord

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,340
is actually Hua Pianpian's brother.

38
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,260
And you made up those things
about nobles.

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,060
Miss Su, come on.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,340
What do you think Leader Hua

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,700
would do if she knew about this?

42
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,100
What do you want?

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,420
The truth.

44
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,220
What happened at that time?

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,580
Who killed my mom?

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,940
Tell me everything.

47
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,340
Chu Feng found that
Lord Jia took bribes

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,460
and ordered to arrest him.

49
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
But Lord Jia

50
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,100
secretly kidnapped Chu Feng

51
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,460
and forced your mom to

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,980
swap Lord Chu's face
with Liang Wuhui's.

53
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,580
Lord Jia.

54
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,620
Good.

55
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,660
You're Chu Feng now.

56
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,300
Don't tell anyone about this.

57
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,180
Copy that.

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,540
After that,

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,460
Lord Jia holed up and

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,300
controlled the whole city behind.

61
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,140
What about Chu Feng?

62
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,220
What happened to him?

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,020
Lord Jia threatened to kill you.

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,100
So your mom had no choice

65
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,100
but to kill Chu Feng.

66
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
Jia just got what he deserved.

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
So,

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,500
all this time,

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,260
you were just using Hua Pianpian.

70
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,940
(Why?)

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,860
(My mom killed Chu Feng?)

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,860
(Why is it like this?)

73
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,100
(My mom killed)

74
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,100
(Chief's father!)

75
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,940
(What should I do?)

76
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,700
Chief.

77
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,460
You're back.

78
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,700
I...

79
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,530
I...

80
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,660
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,820
I...

82
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,500
Current City Lord is not your father.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,940
- He's actually...
- I know.

84
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,780
I know.

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,620
This is what you've been looking for.

86
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,900
How did you get this?

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,140
Mr. San gave it to me.

88
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,580
Mr. San?

89
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,260
We can prove

90
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,700
current City Lord is not Chu Feng now.

91
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,980
(So my mom was killed)

92
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,220
(because of this.)

93
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,500
Chief,

94
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,820
actually, your father...

95
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
I know.

96
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,540
They did all this.

97
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,180
My father would probably have died.

98
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm such an idiot.

99
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,980
How could I never find out?

100
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,100
It's not your fault.

101
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,020
They tricked you.

102
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,060
Don't worry.

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,420
From now on, no matter what happens,

104
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,500
I'll always be with you.

105
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,220
(Chief.)

106
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,980
(Actually, my mom killed your father.)

107
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,060
(I'll tell you everything)

108
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,700
(after this.)

109
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,740
(You can punish me any way you like.)

110
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,140
Chief.

111
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,780
You two made up?

112
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,660
What's the matter?

113
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,020
City Lord invite you to have dinner tonight.

114
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
Go to tell him,

115
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,060
Chief is a bit under the weather.

116
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,900
He can't go.

117
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,900
Okay.

118
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,820
Wait.

119
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,820
Let go of me!

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,540
You can't go there!
You hear me?

121
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,380
Xiaoqiao.

122
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,060
He doesn't know that

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,460
I've found out.

124
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,500
I'll be back soon.

125
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,660
Still can't!

126
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,700
Don't let her leave.

127
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,420
Chief. She... I...

128
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,260
Just do it!

129
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,220
Or I'll tie you up, too.

130
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,260
You can't go!

131
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,450
Here. Yan.

132
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Your favourite fish head.

133
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Why aren't you eating?

134
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,660
Father.

135
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,260
Actually,

136
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,460
I didn't like this years ago.

137
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,900
Father.

138
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,100
What is it you want

139
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,660
to see me about?

140
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,220
Nothing.

141
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300
Here.

142
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,580
Drink with me.

143
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,380
Cheers.

144
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,140
Guards!

145
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,130
Yes!

146
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,020
Put him in jail.

147
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,900
Uh...

148
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,180
You heard me!

149
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,420
Don't let him out
without my permission.

150
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,260
Copy that!
