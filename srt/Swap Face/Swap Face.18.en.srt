Small pendant.

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,320
Brother.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,800
Go away.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,800
Stop fighting.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,200
Stop fighting.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,800
Stop fighting.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,060
Brother.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,440
Stop fighting.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,120
Let my brother go.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,680
- Get out of the way.
- Get off.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, you're lucky today.

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,070
Let's go.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,280
We don't hit women.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,560
Brother,

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,720
are you okay?

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,120
Pianpian,

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I'm good.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,600
With this,

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
I can buy you medicine and food.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Brother.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,000
Brother.

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,380

(Qingfeng Village)

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,800
Miss.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,200
- What's up?
- The clothing.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,160
It's missing a corner.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,920
It has to be Chen Bai.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
Yes.

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:34,180
(Map of Yunjiang City)

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,600
Hua Pianpian,

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,960
now follow me back to the Yame.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,360
Miss Xiaoqiao is so powerful.

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,800
How dare you come to Qingfeng
Village so late to arrest me?

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Tell me what crime I committed.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
You know what you did.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
You'd better not play any tricks.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,840
Why did Lord Chu come to my place

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,880
late at night?

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,840
Of course I'm here to arrest
the suspect.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,640
Why did you kill Lord Jia?

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,840
Is this matter related to the
Medicine Lady case?

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,000
Actually, you should thank me.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,680
I avenged your mother's murder.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
What do you mean?

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,360
If Uncle Chen hadn't told me,

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
I wouldn't know

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
what happened back then.

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,400
What happened back then?

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
Wanna know?

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,200
Just tell me.

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,880
Thirteen years ago,

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,440
Lord Jia was the Chief of
Suzheng Office.

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,400
The younger brother of a noble
killed someone.

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,280
In order to protect his younger brother,

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,280
the noble bribed Lord Jia
with a lot of money.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,600
Lord Jia bent the law for personal gain.

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll tell you the truth.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,640
Hua Pianpian's brother Liang Wuhui

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
was once Lord Jia's subordinate.

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,840
He was responsible for

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,480
dealing with some shady things.

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
One day,

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,160
he was ordered to capture the
face-swapping expert Medicine Lady.

65
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Lord Jia threatened the life of
Medicine Lady's daughter

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,040
and forced her to swap the face
of a murderer.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
Lord Jia is very cunning

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,760
and never kills people himself.

69
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
But my brother discovered this secret

70
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,240
and wanted to use it to blackmail
some money.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Unexpectedly,

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,120
he hired a murderer to silence him.

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,440
So my mom was also killed
by Lord Jia?

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Exactly.

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,240
Lord Jia was afraid that things
would be exposed,

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,920
so he hired people from Qingfeng
Village to kill your mom.

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
He also put the blame on the bandits.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,320
So he got away with it.

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,040
Our goals are the same.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
We are both for the people we love.

81
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,280
I have been an orphan since
I was a child,

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,960
and my brother raised me.

83
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,840
I have to avenge my brother.

84
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Do you think that Lord Jia
should be killed?

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,040
After Suzheng Office finds out the truth,

86
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,360
we'll handle the case impartially

87
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,720
and let Lord Jia receive the
punishment he deserves.

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,520
You and Chen Bo should not
have killed him privately.

89
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,320
Privately?

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,560
It is natural for you officials
to kill people.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,640
But is it wrong for us bandits
to kill bad people?

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
Lord Jia was worried that I
would leak the secret,

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
so he imprisoned me for thirteen years.

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Should he

95
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,480
be put to death?

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,120
Since you know Lord Jia's crime,

97
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,880
you can come to Suzheng Office
to report the case,

98
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
and I will uphold justice.

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Justice?

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,680
Lord Jia is the former Chief
of Suzheng Office.

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
You want me to believe
in Suzheng Office?

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,120
Even if he's the Chief,

103
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,690
as long as he breaks the law,
I will never show favoritism.

104
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,000
What if your father,

105
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,640
City Lord Chu Feng, broke the law?

106
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,920
Nonsense.

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
It's been thirteen years.

108
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,080
Without the protection of
the City Lord,

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,640
could Lord Jia

110
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,680
have been at large until now?

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
You mean the City Lord
protected Lord Jia?

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Do you have evidence?

113
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,280
You think

114
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm lying?

115
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Lord Chu,

116
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
you are still too naive.

117
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
You've only taken over
Suzheng Office for two years.

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,200
You still have a lot to learn.

119
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,240
I will verify what you said.

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,360
Those who hold power make the laws.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,720
You should catch the big
culprit instead of catching

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
a small criminal like me.

123
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,600
Is this what you call justice?

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,080
Justice is inescapable and leakproof.

125
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,520
If the City Lord protected Lord Jia,

126
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I will sue him.

127
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,680
Plus,

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,040
you cannot escape the guilt
of killing Lord Jia.

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
You have to provide evidence

130
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
to prove my crime.

131
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,640
This is the evidence.

132
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
Someone broke into the Village.

133
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,720
The leader asked me to patrol.

134
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,200
I didn't see anyone.

135
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,760
Go check other places.

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,120
This is just a piece of clothing.

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
How about this,

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
you go back

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,840
and find out the truth before
arresting me.

140
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
I'll wait for you.

141
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
(If what Hua Pianpian said is true,)

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,320
(the City Lord protected Lord Jia)

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,360
(and indirectly killed my mom.)

144
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
(Did Lord Chu already know the truth?)

145
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,760
(Did he sneak into Qingfeng Village)

146
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,400
(to help his father destroy the evidence?)

147
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,000
Su Xiaoqiao.

148
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,560
It's you.

149
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,720
You were the one who sent
people to assassinate

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,120
me before, right?

151
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,800
Then why did you

152
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,320
come here to die?

153
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,120
I know why your employer
wants to kill me.

154
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,640
Because of a brocade box.

155
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,240
Inside is the evidence left by my mom.

156
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Gu Qingdai's husband

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,240
died because of it too.

158
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
The brocade box was taken away
by people from Qingfeng Village.

159
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Tell me

160
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,920
where is it?

161
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,080
I don't know what you are
talking about.

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,480
Your employer wants to kill me

163
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
because I will take revenge.

164
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,600
And I just want to avenge my mom.

165
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Hand me over to your employer,

166
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
then you can get paid.

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
I can kill you now

168
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,880
and get paid as well.

169
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,400
I bet

170
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,600
you won't kill me.

171
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,000
Why?

172
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm an official.

173
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,360
If you kill the official,

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,040
you won't be the gang leader.

175
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,160
Hand me over to your employer.

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
You can get double the reward.
