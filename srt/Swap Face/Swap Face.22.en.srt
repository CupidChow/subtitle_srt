00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
Lord Chu! Lord Chu!

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
Lord Chu! Lord Chu!

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,480
Lord Chu!

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,500

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,460
=Episode 22=

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,640
Leader Hua.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,800
Try some of this.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,320
I got it specially for you.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,760
Why do you invite me here today?

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,720
It's really nice.

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Leader Hua, please!

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,520
Leader Hua.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,480
It's not easy to take Yunjiang City.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,800
Everyone here will be involved.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,960
I have to know why
you want to do this.

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,600
So I can persuade others.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
That's why you want to see me?

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't say too

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
much about this.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,760
All you need to know is,

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,080
you'll get half of

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,240
Yunjiang City after this.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,920
Deal?

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,040
Deal.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,600
That's exactly what I want.

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,080
Leader Hua.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
Cheers.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,920
May everything

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,400
goes well.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Great.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
Cheers.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,080
Cheers.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
The wine...

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,560
Du Chong!

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
How dare you!

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
Someone offered me more money.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,840
I had to do this.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
Besides,

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,080
she doesn't want this.

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
You can't force her.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,920
(Contract)
Hua Pianpian is crazy.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,760
She wants to
take Yunjiang City.

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,800
What do you think?

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,480
I'll be on your side.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
My side?

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
Yes.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,680
If you don't want this,

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,840
I'll go stop her.

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,040
I just want to avenge my mom.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
I don't like wars.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
That's exactly why I like you.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,720
You would

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,360
never hurt innocent people.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,200
Gu Qingdai.

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,280
Sorry about all the things before.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,000
I never thought I'd

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,040
do this because of love.

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,740
(Feng)

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,160
This is Leader Hua.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,960
Get lost!

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,240
Thank god we prepared for this.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Why do they want to kill us?

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,040
They think we may

64
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,840
tell others.

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,040
That is so like them.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Untie her.

67
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,410
Don't!

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Get out.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,720
You jerk! I'll avenge

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,800
my brother today.

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,960
Why are you

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,560
still so stubborn?

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,720
What do you mean?

75
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,160
I've been thinking

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,120
about you all these years.

77
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Be with me.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
And we'll never be apart, okay?

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Who are you?

80
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,960
I am Wuhui.

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,400
It's impossible.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,640
He is dead.

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
- Hua.
- Don't!

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
You remember this?

85
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,920
You bound up
this wound for me.

86
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you really Wuhui?

87
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,600
Why didn't you come to see me?

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Hua,

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,880
I can't.

90
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,440
Why?

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,480
Lord Jia forced me to do this,

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,760
or he'll kill you.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,640
I can't talk to you

94
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,600
even when you walk past me.

95
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
You have no idea

96
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,080
how much it hurts.

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
But

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,800
I've been looking
for you for 13 years.

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
I've been looking
for you for 13 years.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Do you know what
I've done for that?

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,040
Do you know how
I lived without you?

102
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,160
Wuhui.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,320
It's my fault.

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
But don't worry.

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,440
The entire Yunjiang City is ours now.

107
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
I can give you everything you want.

108
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,660
Sir! Have a look here!

109
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,870
Steamed buns! Sir!

110
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,540
Trinkets!

111
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,800
Pianpian,

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,440
I bought these for you.

113
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
You want to try some?

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,870
Have a look here!

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
Wuhui.

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,680
Can I marry you

117
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,000
in the future?

118
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
You silly.

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Alright.

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,000
Stop crying.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,320
You'll ruin your makeup.

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,680
So

123
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,480
Mr. Bai knew who you are.

124
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
Why did he lie to me?

125
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
He lied to you?

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,360
And this.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,320
How did you get this?

128
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,480
Gu Qingdai gave it to me.

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,520
Gu Qingdai!

130
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,480
Chief!

131
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
Chief, we'll get you out.

132
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
Chief, we'll get you out.

133
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Let me see.

134
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,320
Are you alright?

135
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm fine.

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,160
It really scared me.

137
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,520
What if they

138
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,320
want to kill me?

139
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
They'd never do that.

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
They still need the power

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
of Suzheng Office.

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,920
You can't guarantee that.

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,240
You got to promise me.

144
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
You won't do something
like this again.

145
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,040
Xiaoqiao, I just want to protect you.

146
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,080
I don't care.

147
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
I really can't.

148
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
You have to.

149
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,640
You have to promise me.

150
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Hello.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Can I say

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
something?

153
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,480
We have to leave now.

154
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,400
Someone is coming over.

155
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,800
Thanks.

156
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
I feel better now.

157
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,560
I'm good.

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,360
Wuhui, what do you plan to do next?

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
Kill all Qingfeng Gang members

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,440
and those who know our secret.

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
After that,

162
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
we can live a happy life forever.

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,200
Have more.

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,960
Alright.

165
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,540
(Qingfeng Village)
