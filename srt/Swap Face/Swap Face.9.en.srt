1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,520
Xiao Qiao, be good. Go inside.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,480
Stay inside and don't make a sound.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,720
No matter what happens, don't come out.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,560
Do you hear me?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,060
(Herbalist, Mother of Su Xiao Qiao)

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,500
=Swap Face=

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,460
=Episode 9=

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,780
Mother.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,140
Mother.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,660
Miss Gu.

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,620
Miss Gu.

12
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,220
What's wrong with you?

13
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,580
(How did you suddenly get a fever?)

14
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,300
(Did something happen?)

15
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,780
What does the Second-in-command want with me?

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
In three days,

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,950
if Gu Qingdai hasn't relinquished
the Chief of the Fort,

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,260
use your special Soft Bone Powder on her.

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,580
Of course.

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,830
When the task is done,

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,380
you'll be rewarded handsomely.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,300
I wonder what reward
the Second-in-command can offer me?

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,820
If I become the Village Chief,

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,820
you'll be the Second-in-command.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,860
Is that all the reward?

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,740
Is that it?

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,260
What more do you want?

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,180
No rush,

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,860
let's discuss it later.

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,060
The death of the former Village Chief.

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,740
You seemed to have helped a lot.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,620
You, Du!

33
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,860
Oh.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,340
What's the matter, you two?

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,900
Alliance Leader.

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,100
Is there another show to watch?

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,940
Why do I always see Xiao Qiao in you?

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,740
Xiao Qiao.

39
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,620
Xiao Qiao.

40
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,580
My lord,

41
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,420
what's wrong with sister-in-law?

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,980
She's feverish and confused.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,740
Maybe she's just too tired.

44
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,180
Quick-run.

45
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,780
It's strange,

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,980
why is Quick-run so close to her?

47
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,020
I recall, except for me,

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,860
it only gets close to little Qiao.

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,100
Running fast, craving roast chicken again?

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,300
Sister is in a good mood today.

51
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,180
Let me share some with you.

52
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,460
He approached Xiao Qiao for grilled chicken.

53
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,260
Why did he approach Sister-in-law?

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,980
Miss Gu has Xiao Qiao's Firearm.

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,820
Perhaps he's close to her because

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,370
he's familiar with the Firearm's scent.

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
What brings you to me today?

58
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,180
Yes, I do.

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,940
However,

60
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,900
it's fine.

61
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,380
Speak.

62
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,550
Xiao Qiao is back.

63
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,620
What?

64
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,760
When?

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,530
Last night, she was injured.

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,540
(Justice Pavilion)

67
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,180
Help me!

68
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,980
Xiao Qiao!

69
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,260
Xiao Qiao!

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,020
What's wrong?

71
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,860
Help me.

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,100
Xiao Qiao!

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,020
Hurry, help!

74
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,020
Alright.

75
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,310
But it's nothing serious, resting inside.

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,820
Sir, do you want to check?

77
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,180
Let's go.

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,140
Gu Qingdai,

79
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,380
you've finally appeared.

80
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,820
(Justice Pavilion)

81
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,660
Xiao Gao,

82
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,260
did you notice anything odd today?

83
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,620
Xiao Qiao usually loves grilled chicken, right?

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,940
Yeah.

85
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,620
Maybe she's sick and has no appetite.

86
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,900
Perhaps. I really don't know.

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,260
I told you, I don't want to eat.

88
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,300
Take it away.

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,140
Shen Su

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,660
- Chase.
- Yes.

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,140
Xiao Qiao, what's wrong?

92
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,260
Is there anything wrong?

93
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,420
Do you know who wants to kill you?

94
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,500
I really don't know.

95
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,730
Rest well first, I'll check it out.

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,060
I was a step too late.

97
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,060
(Are these assassins after me?)

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,100
(Who could it be?)

99
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,380
I just appeared as Xiao Qiao.

100
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,050
He couldn't resist taking action.

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,620
My husband's death,

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,260
was indeed related to them.

103
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,600
(Qian Feng, gang leader of Qingfeng Village)
I will avenge you.

104
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,020
(One month ago)

105
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,310
You're truly despicable.

106
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,780
Don't blame me.

107
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,740
Someone paid for your life.
