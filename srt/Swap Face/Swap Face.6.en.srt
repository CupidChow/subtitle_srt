1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,520
(Hua Pianpian, Wuzhai Tribe Leader)
I've waited so long.

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,980
I think she's
afraid to see you.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,460
Mr. Du, just tell me,

4
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,620
what happened?

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,380
Mrs. Gu married a man.

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,140
He said he
served you before.

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,500
Huh?

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,380
My people?

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,820
=Swap Face=

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,820
=Episode 6=

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,980
Come here.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,870
That's it?

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,870
I thought you're tough.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,150
What now?

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,950
You can't handle
a kept boy?

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,630
It's not like that.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,030
If he really is yours,

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,070
I can't just kill him.

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,990
He's nobody.

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,030
I don't care.

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,430
While you're the second

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,270
leader of Qingfeng Gang.

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,070
It's late.

24
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,390
Why is she still here?

25
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,190
She's the leader
of Wuzhai Tribe.

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,790
I'm sure she is

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,030
brave, smart,

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,110
patient and perseverant.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,670
We can't just hide here.

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,430
We need to
find a way out.

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,270
(She knows so much
about gunpowder?!)

32
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,350
Move!

33
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,630
Miss Gu.

34
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,270
Are you sure

35
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,350
this won't hurt me?

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,350
(He must be testing me.)

37
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,150
(Gu Qingdai is
from a rich family.)

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,910
Don't worry. sir.

39
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,190
I don't want to lose you.

40
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,270
I've read about
how to make gunpowder.

41
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,150
I can also tell
you something

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,510
about me now.

43
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,670
I'm not

44
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,750
just a lady
from a rich family.

45
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,510
I read a lot
of military books,

46
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,710
like The Art...

47
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,430
The Art...

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,990
A military book anyway.

49
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,110
Don't worry, sir.

50
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,230
I'm really impressed.

51
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,990
You know Suzheng
Office pretty well,

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,870
even the exact
place of the armory.

53
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,230
You stole this
from there.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,630
How can you do this?

55
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,110
I...

56
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,430
I didn't.

57
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,190
I bought this
on the black market.

58
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,710
That's the logo
of Suzheng office.

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,350
What can you say now?

60
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,590
This isn't stealing.

61
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,710
I was trying
to save you.

62
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,870
I have to do it.

63
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,190
Besides,

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,510
I know City
Lord's Mansion

65
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,390
pretty well,
not to mention there.

66
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm a gangster.

67
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,670
And I did all
this to help you.

68
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,270
Help me?

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,990
I should
thank you then?

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,150
Is all this

71
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,470
because you like me?

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,590
What are you
talking about?

73
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,670
I know you're very cute.

74
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,390
And there are many girls

75
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,070
having a crush on you.

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,390
Maybe Ms. Hua will

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,590
fall for you

78
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,990
at first sight.

79
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,950
Bah.

80
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,430
Come here.

81
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,070
Sorry about that.

82
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,670
What's that sound?

83
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,790
Mian Bugu!

84
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,990
It seemingly came
from your room.

85
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,870
Honey!

86
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,070
Wake up! Wake up!

87
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,710
Honey!

88
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,070
Please!

89
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,590
I can't lose you.

90
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,190
Gu Qingdai!

91
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,150
How dare you do this!

92
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,190
My husband and I
accidentally blew it up

93
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,750
on our way
to steal gunpowder.

94
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,590
You!

95
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,150
I hurt my husband!

96
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,950
Honey, stay with me!

97
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,870
I can't lose you!

98
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,990
Enough.

99
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,910
Hua Pianpian is here.

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,870
Say something.

101
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,750
Quickly.

102
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,150
Honey.

103
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,590
Sweetie.

104
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,710
What?

105
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,310
I'm hurt,

106
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,550
but I still
have my arms.

107
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,150
I can still

108
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,310
hold you.

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,630
Where is that
coming from?

110
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,030
I didn't expect
to see this

111
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,830
once I got here.

112
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,630
Honey.

113
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,830
You must love
your husband so much.

114
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,910
You didn't even
bother to see me.

115
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,790
I finally meet you.

116
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,390
Please forgive me.

117
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,710
I got caught up.

118
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,910
My husband is
seriously injured.

119
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,990
He has to see
a doctor now.

120
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,930
Be careful.

121
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,110
Ms. Hua.

122
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,990
Is he really

123
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,550
your people?

124
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,910
But if so,

125
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,070
please don't
take him away.

126
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,030
If he is a spy from

127
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,070
Suzheng Office
or something,

128
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,310
Mrs. Gu, you'd
better have an

129
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,270
(Suzheng Office)
explanation for this.

130
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,950
I saw a man
walking past

131
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,790
when I was
near leader's room.

132
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,990
(Suzheng Office)
This is his.

133
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,230
This is his badge?

134
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,150
He's from
Suzheng Office!

135
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,190
Suzheng Office.

136
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,030
How did you get

137
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,390
the badge we stole?

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,950
It was stolen.

139
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,230
If we didn't lose it,

140
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,910
we wouldn't

141
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,910
just steal this little.

142
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,510
You can't prove it.

143
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,510
Now Ms. Hua is here,

144
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,270
please tell us.

145
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,390
Who are you to
talk to me like this?

146
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,430
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
