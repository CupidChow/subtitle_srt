1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
Hey, what's wrong?

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,320
I think I twisted my ankle.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,720
Come on, let me help you up.

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,720
Be careful.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,000
Try moving it like this.

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,960
It really feels better.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,640
This is for you.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,000
What is this?

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,400
A wooden fire lance.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,760
Keep it with you from now on.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,240
This way, you can protect yourself.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,060
=Swap Face=

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,020
=Episode 11=

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,840
The three-day deadline is up.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
I agree to marry you.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,080
I can also give you the Chief of the Fort.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,760
But I have a condition.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,280
We will only be husband and wife in name.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,880
At any time,

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,120
there must be no overstepping boundaries.

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm afraid

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,120
this is inappropriate.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,480
All you ever wanted was Chief of the Fort.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,880
As for me,

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,320
this is my boundary.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,640
The Chief of the Fort,

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,080
if I desire it, I can achieve it.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,480
Don't you understand yet?

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,040
In my heart,

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,120
this is the fourth time
you've aimed a Firearm at me.

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
No woman has ever dared to defy me like this.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,680
Don't push me.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
You must promise me.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,640
Or we'll both go down together.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
If it comes to a fight,

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
I might not lose to you.

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,400
Fine, I promise you.

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
(Enjoy your moment of triumph).

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,280
(Once I find the Brocade Box
and return to the Yamen),

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,440
(I'll ensure you face justice).

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Sir,

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
I just stoked the fire.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Oh.

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,160
Sir, you're making medicine yourself?

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
In the entire Justice Pavilion,

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,640
only Xiao Qiao receives such care.

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,880
Even heroes fall for beauty's charm.

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
Nonsense!

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,680
She was injured on duty,

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,680
I must take good care of her.

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,720
You like her but won't admit it.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,840
I told you before to make a move early.

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,800
But you insisted on being cold.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,520
Now you're ignoring her.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,240
Why are you talking so much today?

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,480
When Xiao Qiao first
joined the Justice Pavilion,

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Sir, you've always taken extra care of her.

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,500
(One year ago)

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
Sir, I'm the new arrival.

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
My name is Su Xiaoqiao.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,120
My connection with her is deep.

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
Naturally, I treat her well.

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
Hmm...

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Forgetting friends for beauty.

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,840
Don't just stand there, get a bowl.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,720
How long has Xiao Qiao been here?

68
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,320
About a year or so.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,560
A Junior Constable not yet official,

70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,680
what enemies could she have?

71
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,640
They sent assassins to kill her.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,520
There's more to this than meets the eye.

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
Could it be a Blood Feud?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
It's not impossible.

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
Alright, go quickly.

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Find out more about her background.

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,880
Understood, Sir.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,480
Blood Feud.

79
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
(Justice Pavilion)
Hey, how many times must I say this?

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,200
No unauthorized entry allowed.

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm here to deliver clothes to Master Chu.

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,360
I'll leave right after.

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,200
Even a tailor can't enter.

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
You.

85
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
Just hand the clothes to me.

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,640
(I'll remember this for now.)

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,920
(Wait till I return.)

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,360
(See how I deal with you.)

89
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,360
Chu Yan.

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,520
Chu Yan, come out!

91
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,120
Chu Yan.

92
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, sister-in-law is here!

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
So bitter!

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,300
Ah.

95
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,440
It's so bitter.

96
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,160
Sir, she is...

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,560
She's the one I mentioned earlier.

98
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
The Eldest Miss of the Gu Family.

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
Ah.

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,440
So, this is Miss Gu.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,200
It seems I came at a bad time.

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
I'll take my leave now.

103
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,040
Hey, Miss Gu,

104
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
it's getting late.

105
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,000
Why don't you stay for a simple meal?

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
Xiao Qiao never cared about dressing up before,

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
but lately, she's dressing more femininely.

108
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,240
She's no less charming than Miss Gu.

109
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,240
Has Sir shifted his affections so easily?

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,840
Su Xiaoqiao.

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
Have a chicken leg.

112
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,480
Miss Gu is our guest, you eat.

113
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,320
It's alright.

114
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,160
I heard Miss Su loves chicken.

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,760
Come on, you eat.

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
No, you have it.

117
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,840
- You eat.
- No, you eat.

118
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,120
- Please, you eat.
- You first.

119
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,960
Alright.

120
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Everyone gets some.

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
Let's eat together.

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,920
Make way.

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,760
What would you two singles know?

124
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,610
Tch.

125
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,520
Sir calls this

126
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,480
sharing affection.

127
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,560
Balancing two interests elegantly.

128
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,040
One day,

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,760
you might slip.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,080
Flirting even while eating.

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
How vulgar

132
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,240
runs fast.

133
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
Check who the lord prefers.

134
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,740
(Sùzhèng Pavilion)

135
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,360
(This Gu Qingdai flirts with the lord)

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
(Can't delay anymore)

137
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
(We must find the brocade box quickly)

138
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,660
(I know you deliberately sent me away)

139
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,220
(It was for my safety)

140
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,580
The leader has forgotten

141
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,460
I've taken lives right in front of you.

142
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm giving you three days.

143
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,020
Surrender the Chief of the Fort.

144
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,860
Become my Village Mistress.

145
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,420
Otherwise,

146
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,460
both she and Chu Yan will die.

147
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,430
Don't worry,

148
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,220
I won't let you face this alone.

149
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,840
It's so late,

150
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,300
what does the Alliance Leader want?

151
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,020
The Village Chief has finally returned.

152
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,460
The Justice Pavilion's dinner must be tastier.

153
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,140
Alliance Leader, just say what you mean.

154
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,980
Last time, you mentioned stealing some
gunpowder from the Justice Pavilion.

155
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,980
I see that Chief Gu has some skills.

156
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,460
So, I want to ask you a favor.

157
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,740
Help me rescue someone
from the Justice Pavilion's prison.

158
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,620
Alliance Leader, you must be joking.

159
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,620
I'm only good at petty theft.

160
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,780
I can't handle such a major task
as a prison break.

161
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,580
You should find someone else
as the leader.

162
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,240
Yes, I think the Second-in-command
would be a good choice.

163
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,340
Miss Xiaoqiao, there's no need
to refuse in haste.

164
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,540
What did you just call me?

165
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,980
How capable do you think you are?

166
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,180
Oh, I know your abilities very well.
