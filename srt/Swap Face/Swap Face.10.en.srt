1
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,400
Xiao Qiao.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,040
(Shouldn't Su Xiaoqiao walk like this?)

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,560
Xiao Gao, stop lingering in the outhouse.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,920
Xiao Qiao has entered the Armory.

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,620
=Swap Face=

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,580
=Episode 10=

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,380
(Armory)

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,560
(Su Xiaoqiao is skilled with various weapons)

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
(I must imitate her closely)

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
(To deceive those at the Yamen)

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,040
Xiao Qiao,

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,400
your wound hasn't healed yet,

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,000
but you're rushing to the Armory.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,960
Sir,

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,080
Xiao Qiao's wound is fine now.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
I have nothing to do today,

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,280
so I came to the Armory.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
You're usually so untidy,

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,360
but today,

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,400
you cleaned the Armory so well.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm usually a bit messy,

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,720
but today's dust was overwhelming.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,160
So, I came to tidy up.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,080
Xiao Qiao,

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,240
on the wedding day,

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,680
what exactly happened?

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,190
Where have you been these days?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,960
That day,

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,120
I was knocked out,

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,960
and woke up in a dark room.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,960
Managed to escape with difficulty.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,270
The people who imprisoned you,

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,740
were they from Clear Breeze Fort?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,560
Xiao Qiao isn't sure.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,680
They were masked that day.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
Couldn't tell
if they were from Clear Breeze Fort.

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,920
But I can confirm one thing,

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,720
they're the same group
that attacked me yesterday.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,600
Fortunately, Sir arrived in time,

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,840
and saved Xiao Qiao's life.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
(What's happening to me)

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,960
(Why does Xiao Qiao)

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,160
(feel so unfamiliar)

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,560
It's getting late today,

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,760
better rest early.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,880
Why is she so distant?

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,680
Could it be,

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
she's sensed something?

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,640
Here I come.

50
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Just in time.

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,440
If we're late,
the grilled chicken will be gone.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,800
Xiao Qiao,
why aren't you eating the grilled chicken?

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
The grilled chicken is too greasy.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
Getting injured makes you eat so cautiously.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,000
The doctor advised me to eat lightly.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Plus, my injury hasn't fully healed.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
So I naturally eat a bit slower.

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,120
You know, since Xiao Qiao returned
these two days,

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,880
the Armory hasn't exploded even once.

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,720
Isn't that something?

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
My constipation is cured.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
Xiao Qiao,

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
are you not making gunpowder?

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,600
My injuries aren't fully healed,

65
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,200
I can't handle the smell right now.

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,560
(Why does Xiao Qiao seem different?)

67
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,990
(Like a completely different person.)

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
Miss,

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,960
I swear I didn't break the vase.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,640
If not you, then who else?

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,080
No one entered after you did.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,760
But Miss,

73
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
it truly wasn't me.

74
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,440
Stop talking.

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,760
I don't need clumsy people like you.

76
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Leave at once.

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Miss,

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,960
I've been with you for years.

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,720
You're dismissing me over a vase?

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,320
For the sake of our time together,

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
keep this silver for yourself.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
Hurry up and leave.

83
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,800
Go quickly!

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
Gu Qingdai,

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,320
I knew you would come for me.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,480
How does it feel to be Village Chief?

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,840
I've searched the entire village.

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,440
Even Du Chong's room,

89
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,800
was turned upside down.

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,360
I couldn't find the Brocade Box.

91
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,600
Are you lying to me?

92
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,800
Really?

93
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,720
You blew up Du Chong's room.

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,240
Why didn't you use more gunpowder?

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
You might as well have blown him up too.

96
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,720
That's enough.

97
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Where is the Brocade Box?

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,760
I also want to know where it is.

99
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,560
You're playing me.

100
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,480
I want to know its secrets even more.

101
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,120
So many have died for it.

102
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,200
The secret of the brocade box,

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,680
is only in Qingfeng Village.

104
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Can you find it?

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,440
It depends on your own skills.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll trust you one last time.

107
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,360
(In the dead of night)

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
(Why is she in Xiao Qiao's room?)

109
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
Lord Chu,

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
what are you doing?

111
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
I wanted to ask you,

112
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
where did this wooden fire lance come from?

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
Did you pick it up again?

114
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
I stole it.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,640
I just returned from the Justice Pavilion,

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,920
it looked intriguing,

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,840
so I took it.

118
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,840
What were you doing at the Justice Pavilion?

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,120
Tell me honestly.

120
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,880
To be honest,

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,520
where I go is my choice.

122
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
It's none of your business.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm your husband, I do care.

124
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,480
We're only so in name.

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,600
By the way, I inform you.

126
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
From today onward,

127
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
we have no relation.

128
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
What do you mean?

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,760
I mean,

130
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,840
I've decided to leave you.

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,040
Divorce you.

132
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,600
Now I've secured the Chief of the Fort.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Keeping you serves no purpose for me.

134
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Such a simple truth.

135
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,000
Surely, Sir, you understand it.

136
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,280
I see.

137
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,360
Very well.

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,200
We were always using each other.

139
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
Indeed.

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,880
So from now on,

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,120
don't come back again.

142
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
There's nothing between us anymore.
