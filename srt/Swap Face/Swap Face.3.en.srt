1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,860
Greetings, Father.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,340
How did the task go?

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,220
The brocade box you mentioned,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,380
besides the crow pattern,

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,460
are there other features?

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,219
What is the origin of this item,

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,620
that it can threaten the city?

8
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:18,720
(City Lord of Yunjiang City)

9
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:19,539
According to the spies,

10
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,071
the brocade box contains

11
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:22,476
alliance letters from major villages.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,420
Yan.

13
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:25,027
Once the brocade box is found,

14
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,607
it must be destroyed immediately.

15
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
Father, rest assured,

16
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,460
I will do my utmost.

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,580
=Swap Face=

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,580
=Episode 3=

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,950
(Dare to trick me?)

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,590
(I must have him stay temporarily.)

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,590
(I can also cover up things in the village.)

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,630
I'm sure you already know,

23
00:00:57,636 --> 00:00:59,796
the attackers were from Qingfeng Village.

24
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,190
(Xiaoqiao's disappearance is linked to them.)

25
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,042
(It's better to stay here for now.)

26
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,070
(We might find the brocade box.)

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,139
(Qingfeng Village)

28
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,177
(I heard treasures are)

29
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:26,080
(hidden in this secret room.)

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,430
(Could the brocade box be here too?)

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,550
(Gu Qingdai shouldn't lie to me.)

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,590
(If the box is truly important,)

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,350
(it should be hidden in this secret room)

34
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:40,750
(I must find it quickly.)

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,710
(Switch back my face with Gu Qingdai)

36
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:16,863
Oh, it's you, my husband.

37
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,487
I thought it was some thief.

38
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,350
Why aren't you sleeping at night?

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,670
What are you looking for here?

40
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:22,836
And you, my wife?

41
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,870
Staying up so late at night.

42
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,510
Wearing stealth clothes here.

43
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,470
Are you not guarding but stealing?

44
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,430
You snuck into Qingfeng Village at night,

45
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,150
surely not just to find Miss Su, right?

46
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,350
Since we're already married,

47
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,830
my dear husband, why not be honest?

48
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,350
Alright,

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,830
I came to gather evidence,

50
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,190
to bring this place

51
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,550
to justice.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
(Who are you fooling?)

53
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:58,716
(You've gathered quite enough evidence here.)

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,670
(You must have other motives.)

55
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:02,110
(Regarding the brocade box,)

56
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:03,710
(I'd better keep her out of this.)

57
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:05,630
Is that so?

58
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,343
What do you plan to do with me

59
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,647
after it's done, my Lord?

60
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,870
That depends on your performance, my Madam.

61
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,430
If you do well,

62
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,710
you can atone for your mistakes.

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,070
I'll be lenient.

64
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,390
Should I thank you then, my lord?

65
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,750
But, my husband,

66
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,070
we're outside,

67
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,990
we should act like a loving couple.

68
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,149
I advise you, Miss Gu,

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,481
not to fantasize too much.

70
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Who's there?

71
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,350
I'm so cold, husband.

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,470
Who's there?

73
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,910
It's the gang leader.

74
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,910
Hey,

75
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,790
we didn't see anything.

76
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,869
Nothing at all.

77
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:53,322
(I've heard Miss Gu)

78
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,429
(eloped with the former leader.)

79
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,240
(They showed affection everywhere)

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,350
(never hiding their feelings.)

81
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:58,841
(It seems the rumors are true.)

82
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,070
Ouch!

83
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,315
My neck!

84
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,710
This hammock is so uncomfortable.

85
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,210
Enter.

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,589
Miss, you called for me?

87
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,434
Quickly, you're just in time.

88
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:19,359
Hurry, hurry.

89
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:20,630
Miss, what's wrong?

90
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,510
My hand here

91
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:22,715
feels a bit numb.

92
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,190
Is it still numb?

93
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,510
Let me press it for you.

94
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,350
No need.

95
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,030
Don't move, stay still.

96
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,309
Miss,

97
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,230
was that young master impressive yesterday?

98
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,350
Impressive in what way?

99
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,550
You guys are really going wild with this!

100
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,030
What are you thinking?

101
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,390
Why are you looking for me?

102
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,278
The leaders want you

103
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,819
to host the gang's meeting.

104
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,470
What? The gang's meeting?

105
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:58,670
Today,

106
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,030
our gang's meeting

107
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,910
will mainly focus on discussing

108
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,470
the future plans for Qingfeng Village.

109
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,510
Well,

110
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,910
let the person at the back speak first.

111
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,702
I've gathered information on

112
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,959
Master Lu's itinerary.

113
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,430
We can rob him

114
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,270
and make a big profit.

115
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,270
In my opinion,

116
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,510
we should continue on to Yunjiang City,

117
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,270
find a few young ladies,

118
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,990
then sell them to the villages.

119
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,790
It would be profitable.

120
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,470
Leader, let me tell you,

121
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,110
there are many wealthy families nearby.

122
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,590
We just collect protection fees, so simple.

123
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,870
Someone offered a high price,

124
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,110
for Lord Liu's head from Yunjiang City.

125
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,350
Why is it always about robbery?

126
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,830
Leader, aren't we bandits?

127
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,340
If we don't rob and plunder,

128
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
what will we eat and drink?

129
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,020
Exactly! Exactly!

130
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,900
He is right!

131
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,740
If you ask me,

132
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,476
if you can give us

133
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,147
all of your family's wealth,

134
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,300
we'll stop our wrongdoings.

135
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,140
Right?

136
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,420
Of course!

137
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,460
He is right!

138
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,500
Everyone, don't worry.

139
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,460
Gang leader is quite clever.

140
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,580
She might have thought of

141
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,300
a way to support us.

142
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,140
(What do you mean?)

143
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,100
(Trying to see me embarrassed?)

144
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,140
(Just wait and see!)

145
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,260
Yes, there is.

146
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,100
There is a way.

147
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,220
Your small endeavors like this

148
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,740
won't earn much money.

149
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,540
Let's aim for something big.

150
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,900
We can annex another village.

151
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
By doing so,

152
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,900
we'll have more people,

153
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,340
and more wealth too.

154
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
Isn't that better?

155
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,700
Yes, the leader is right.

156
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,620
That works too.

157
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,940
Alright, let's do that. Meeting adjourned.

158
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
(Miss Gu's way of handling things)

159
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,660
(is really quite different from the rumors.)

160
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,340
(Instead, it gives me a sense of familiarity.)

161
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,580
Boss,

162
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:07,980
I think Gu Qindai

163
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,140
is doing this on purpose.

164
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Didn't she say before...

165
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,534
Don't you think she

166
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:12,885
seems like a different person?

167
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,260
Or maybe,

168
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,860
she was hiding her true self?

169
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Send for Leader Hua to Qingfeng Village.

170
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,143
We have important matters to discuss.

171
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,520
As you command.
