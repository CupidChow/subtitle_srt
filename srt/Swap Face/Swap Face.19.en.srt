1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,920
Sorry.

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,280
They threaten me with my daughter.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,360
I have to do this.

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,500
=Swap Face=

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,460
=Episode 19=

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,560
Xiaoqiao,

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,920
if the City Lord bends the law for
personal gain,

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,760
I will sue him.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,640
Lord Chu,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,040
don't lie to me.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,480
Did you go to Qingfeng Village
to look for

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,400
the brocade box?

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,580
(Map of Qingfeng Village)
I saw the marks you made on the map.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,960
The evidence that Lord Chu

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,240
told me last time

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,800
was probably just an excuse.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
I'll take it as your consent.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,160
Xiaoqiao, let's not

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,200
speculate on each other before

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
there is solid evidence.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,440
The City Lord is your father,

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,680
so you dare not to doubt him.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,960
Right?

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Xiaoqiao,

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,720
Lord Jia is dead.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,480
Your mom's revenge has been avenged.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,720
Give me some time.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,360
I will get to the bottom of this case.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,280
I'll uphold…

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Gang leader Gu.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
I have something to ask you.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,920
Thanks to you for saving me before.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Thank you.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,600
I didn't mean to save you.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm here to ask

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
who the noble is who bribed Lord Jia?

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
Besides,

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
has the City Lord been protecting
Lord Jia?

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,640
It seems that Chu Yan still
hasn't told you the truth.

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
I don't know the details either.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
But,

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
yesterday, Uncle Chen…

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,040
I don't know who that noble is.

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,560
But yesterday,

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,240
after I told Chu Yan about this,

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
he was very excited.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,320
He should have guessed who
that person was.

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,480
It seems that he has a close
relationship with that noble.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,360
Who could be the person that
Lord Chu

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
openly protects?

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
(Lord Chu is hiding something from me.)

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,760
Miss,

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,880
why are you so interested
in the Medicine Lady?

54
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,560
Uncle Chen may not know

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,120
that she is Su Xiaoqiao, the
daughter of the Medicine Lady.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
She had swapped faces with
Miss Gu before.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,560
The hatred of killing one's
mother is irreconcilable.

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,160
Miss Su,

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,730
you have to find him out.

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
Humph.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
Why are you laughing?

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,960
Because you're stupid.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
You will die

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,790
of revenge.

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,600
If you want to achieve your goal,

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,960
you have to take risks.

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
You overestimate yourself.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
He's more powerful than me.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Huh?

71
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,640
You want to die for me?

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm serious.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm not joking.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,160
Anyways,

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,920
thank you.

76
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,480
To be honest,

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,240
you have helped me twice.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
Twice?

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
When was the last time?

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Who?

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Have a look.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
No one.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
It's a wildcat.

84
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,120
What do you want?

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,440
I want you to marry me to the
village in a grand manner.

86
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,800
Su Xiaoqiao.

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,720
Su Xiaoqiao,

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
here she is.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Great.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Get out of here.

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
Are you ready to die?

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Hold on.

93
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
I know what you want.

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,240
You want to kill me,

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
and…

96
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,440
Come with me.

97
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,780
(Hua Pianpian, Mysterious Man,
Medicine Lady)

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Who is this mysterious man?

99
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
How did you break in?

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,080
What are you here for?

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,560
What am I here for?

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I'm here to see my wife.

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
You…

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
If you dare to act recklessly,
I will shoot you.

105
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
I should have thought of it.

106
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Gu Qingdai can't use a gun.

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,360
You are not Gu Qingdai.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Are you drunk?

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Cut the crap.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
You

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,760
are not Gu Qingdai.

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
Who told you?

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,200
How did you know?

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,680
I didn't expect that you, a constable,

115
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,960
have become a bandit now.

116
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
Hua Pianpian, that crazy woman,

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,280
wants to attack Yunjiang City.

118
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
You're not her spy, are you?

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,320
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,940
(Contract Wuzhai Tribe Attacks Yunjiang City)

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
Do you think she

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,040
will take the bait?

123
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Definitely.

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,480
She will be affected by the
mood of revenge.

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
With her assistance,

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,640
our plan has a better chance
of winning.

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,040
Attacking Yunjiang City is
no small matter.

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,000
Are you sure about it?

129
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,120
Yes, I have made up my mind

130
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,520
Yunjiang City needs a new owner.

131
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,400
Uncle Chen,

132
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,920
will you support me?

133
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,480
It is also my wish to avenge
your brother.

134
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,440
Give me the handkerchief.

135
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,840
If I give it to you,

136
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
will you kill me?

137
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,600
I can

138
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
kill you if I want.

139
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm going to die anyway.

140
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Let me know who you are.

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
There's no one else.

142
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
Let me see

143
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
who you are.

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay.

145
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,480
I will fulfill your wish.

146
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,960
Chu Feng.

147
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,360
(City Lord?)

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,640
You killed so many people
for that brocade box.

149
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,680
What secrets are hidden in it?

150
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,280
What is your motive?

151
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
You

152
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
don't have to know.

153
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Give me the handkerchief.

154
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you think…

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Do you think you can keep
hiding it forever?

156
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,800
(My mom's death was indeed
related to the City Lord.)

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,440
If you want to know who
killed your mother,

158
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
follow me tonight.

159
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,640
You want to use yourself as
bait to lure out the murderer.

160
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
No, it's too dangerous.

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,840
Why not?

162
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
If I die,

163
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,160
Lord Chu will be your man.

164
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
No worries.

165
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
I have my

166
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
own way to get out.

167
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,640
(If it weren't for Gu Qingdai,)

168
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
(I'm afraid I would still be in the dark.)

169
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,600
This is your last chance.

170
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Give me the handkerchief.

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,800
You're right.

172
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,400
Now it doesn't matter to me

173
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,960
what is in that broken box.

174
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,880
(No.)

175
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,560
(Gu Qingdai,)

176
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,600
(Why are you so stupid?)
