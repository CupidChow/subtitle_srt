(The Case File of the Medicine Lady)

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,720
Su Xiaoqiao

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,480
is the daughter of the Medicine Lady.

=Episode 14=

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,400
Lord.

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Come in.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
Is there any news from
Qingfeng Village?

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,280
The spy sent a message that

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,640
my sister-in-law and Du Chong
are not in Qingfeng Village.

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Stay tuned.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
Okay.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Lord.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
What happened?

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,760
What are you whispering about?

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,600
Lord, there is news from the
City Lord's Mansion.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Gu Qingdai was caught for jailbreaking.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
What?

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Lord.

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,320
We got it.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,840
- You can leave now.
- Alright.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,680
Lord.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,320
Gu Qingdai is

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,280
one hundred percent bold and reckless.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
Does she have no brain?

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,600
Hua Pianpian.

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,960
(City Lord's Mansion)

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,400
The people from Qingfeng Village
are so rampant.

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,200
They not only hurt Yan,

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,770
but also dared to come to jailbreak.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,160
How is Yan's injury?

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,680
Lord Chu is fine.

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,080
But since the people from Qingfeng Village

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
have already kidnapped the criminal Chen Bai,

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,920
why did they leave the gang leader behind?

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
I think

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
maybe they had an internal conflict,

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,720
so they left a scapegoat.

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not that simple.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,480
I will try this case myself.

41
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,760
How is Lord Chu?

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,600
Shame on you.

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,470
The knife is poisonous.

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,440
He almost died because of you.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
Fortunately, he is out of danger now.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,320
Untie me real quick.

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
Then I pretend to knock you out.

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Su Xiaoqiao.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
Do you think our identities were not
exposed fast enough?

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,280
But Lord Chu is…

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
You'd better mind your own business.

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,750
How dare you come to Suzheng Office
to jailbreak?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm forced.

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,200
Hua Pianpian knew

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
that you and I had swapped faces,

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,920
so she threatened me with this.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
How could Hua Pianpian know this?

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
How do I know?

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,000
City Lord will ask you later,

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,200
don't say anything.

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,600
After today,

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,520
I'll find a way to get you out.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,920
What's your relationship with Chen Bai?

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,560
Why do you want to jailbreak?

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,600
Do you have accomplices?

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,720
If you tell the truth,

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,720
you will be spared from torture.

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,920
I… I don't know anything.

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,200
You can beat or kill me as you like.

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,760
What a tough girl.

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,080
Get ready.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,320
Okay.

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
How about now?

74
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Okay.

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,240
I will whip you until you speak.

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
Yan.

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,240
What are you doing?

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
Dad,

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,240
I think there are still many doubts
about the prison break.

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Miss Gu may have been wrongly accused.

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
Nonsense.

82
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,560
She is a bandit.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,520
How is she wronged?

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,280
Yes, she is a bandit.

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,560
But she's not bad in nature.

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,000
If it weren't for her,

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,160
I would have died in Qingfeng Village.

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Yan.

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Have you forgotten what I
taught you before?

90
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,240
We must handle cases impartially
and with integrity.

91
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Do you really want to plead for
a gangster?

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Dad.

93
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,280
- Give me a few days.
- Shut up.

94
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
Dad,

95
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,720
I guarantee with my life that

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,040
Gu Qingdai is not a villain.

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,640
Well.

98
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
I will give you a few more days.

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
If Chen Bai cannot be captured,

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Gu Qingdai will be beheaded in public,

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,130
which will just destroy the
prestige of Qingfeng Gang.

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,280
You disappoint me so much.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Thank you, dad.

104
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,590
Lord Chu, you…

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,920
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
It's all good.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Don't be afraid.

108
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Lord Chu,

109
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,760
I saw something strange about
Xiaoqiao two days ago.

110
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
So I looked it up

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
and it turns out that she is indeed
not an ordinary person.

112
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Her mother is the Medicine Lady.

113
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
Medicine Lady?

114
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,640
The Medicine Lady case was
very strange back then.

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,760
No wonder Xiaoqiao has been
acting weird lately.

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,520
Is she investigating her mother's case?

117
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,600
Maybe.

118
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
And the case file said

119
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,120
that the Medicine Lady is famous

120
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,440
not only because of her superb medical skills,

121
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,520
but also because she possesses a
long-lost unique skill.

122
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Swap Face.

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,320
Swap Face?

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,440
Who was the presiding judge in
the Medicine Lady case?

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Lord Jia.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,900
Ask Lord Jia to come quickly.

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
But, you are still injured.

128
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
Go ahead.

129
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,440
Lord Chu.

130
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Why did you invite me to have tea today?

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,920
Lord Jia has been helping

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
my father with affairs for so many years,

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
and I should have visited you more often.

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,520
But there are so many things to do
in the Office recently.

135
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
I hope that Lord Jia

136
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
will forgive me for any impoliteness.

137
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,960
Never mind.

138
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
I know you very well.

139
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Now,

140
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,920
Suzheng Office is being managed
so well by Lord Chu

141
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,640
and I, the former City Lord,
am also very pleased.

142
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,200
I just did my job.

143
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
I invited Lord Jia here today

144
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
because I have an old case to ask you.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Old case?

146
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Yes.

147
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,600
Go ahead, Lord Chu.

148
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
The case of the Medicine Lady 13 years ago.

149
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,080
Lord Jia, do you still remember it?

150
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
Why is Lord Chu suddenly so concerned

151
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
about the case of the Medicine Lady?

152
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,480
To be honest,

153
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,680
there is a new case recently

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,560
that seems to be related to the case
of the Medicine Lady.

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
The Medicine Lady killed people
when she cured them,

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,280
so she was hunted down by her enemies

157
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,600
and murdered.

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
Anyway, she deserved it.

159
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
Please.

160
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,340
(The Majesty Comes from the East)

161
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,240
It has been 13 years.

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,400
I can't remember when I last
looked at the sky.

163
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,160
Uncle Chen,

164
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
it's all my fault that I didn't
find your trace earlier.

165
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
Don't worry.

166
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,480
From now on,

167
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,080
I will never let those people from
Yunjiang City hurt you again.

168
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,160
Pianpian,

169
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,600
you have never

170
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,950
given up looking for your
brother all these years.

171
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,640
You have suffered a lot.

172
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,600
Uncle Chen, do you know where
my brother is now?

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
Your brother

174
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,520
is dead.

175
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,600
What did you say?

176
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
How did he die?

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
He was framed.

178
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,360
Who killed him?

179
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,360
I only know

180
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
that his death is related to the
murder of the Medicine Lady.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,280
Medicine Lady?

182
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,400
Su Xiaoqiao.
