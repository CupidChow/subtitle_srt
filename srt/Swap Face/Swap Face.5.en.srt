1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,220
Let go of me!

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm hot.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm hot.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm hot.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm so hot.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,300
He drugged you?

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,380
=Swap Face=

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,380
=Episode 5=

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,670
(Du Chong is such a jerk.)

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,830
(I can't imagine what would)

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,830
(happen if I didn't show up in time.)

12
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,830
How are you now?

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,270
Don't leave.

14
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,190
Plaese help me.

15
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,270
I still don't have

16
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,350
much power here.

17
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,110
Only you can help me.

18
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,110
My parents died when I was little.

19
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,430
And someone took my sister away.

20
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,710
I can't let these girls suffer this.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,270
Please help me.

22
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,510
Help me.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,070
Help save these girls.

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,190
That's what you

25
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,230
think right now?

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,310
Gu Qingdai.

27
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,110
I haven't met you before.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,630
But why

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,110
are you so familiar?

30
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,510
(Chief brought me here last night.)

31
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,470
(I acted like that yesterday?!)

32
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,190
(What would he think of me)

33
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,510
(if he knew I was Xiaoqiao?)

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,750
(This is so humiliating.)

35
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,950
Mr. Chu.

36
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,190
About yesterday.

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
It's alright.

38
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,510
You were drugged by Du Chong.

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,790
It's fine.

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,110
Bah!

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,910
Jerk!

42
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,470
He is still powerful here.

43
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,310
After I take the power,

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,470
I'll avenge this.

45
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,150
You can deal with him later.

46
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,030
I know you want to

47
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,990
save the girls here.

48
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,430
You knew about this?

49
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm really

50
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,830
impressed by your kindness.

51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,660
Kindness?

52
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,340
What kind of

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,740
person do you think I am?

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,900
Silly.

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,420
Clumsy.

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,940
Slow-minded.

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,620
- What...
- That's what I thought.

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,300
Now I think you're

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,660
a little smart.

60
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,980
Humph.

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,780
You're smart.

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,380
Can you think of a way then?

63
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,380
I think your idea

64
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,700
of finding the enemy is good.

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,100
What exactly?

66
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,500
Mr. Peng has a sworn
enemy there,

67
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,660
a bully, Mr. Liu.

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,100
They're rivals
in business.

69
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,700
There would
never be 2 kings

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,540
in one place.

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,860
I thought of this!

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,100
We thought
exactly the same.

73
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,340
Breakfast time.

74
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,340
Warm soup!

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,320
- He'll be...
- Umbrella!

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,420
here any minute.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
- Why didn't he show up?
- Trinkets!

78
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,280
Warm soup!

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,150
Take a look.

80
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,600
Miss, have a look.

81
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,310
Trinkets.

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,500
Mr. Liu.

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,860
What...

84
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,580
Mr. Liu, you might not

85
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,940
know this,
Mr. Peng is trying

86
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,540
to buy the girls
in our village.

87
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,820
Jerk!

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,180
Mr. Liu. Please.

89
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,620
Please help us!

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,630
Uh.

91
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,230
I think

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,380
it'd be better
if Mr. Liu

93
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,980
bought all the girls.

94
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,660
Mr Liu is the most
powerful person here.

95
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,460
Maybe he'll
help us later.

96
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,540
Right?

97
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,460
Hmm.

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,940
Okay. Okay.

99
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,780
(Liu)

100
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,820
Mr. Liu heard you
wanted to buy them.

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,740
So he offered
300 liang.

102
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,780
He even said he'd

103
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,020
never let
you get them.

104
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,980
I talked

105
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,300
and talked

106
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,980
(The chicken
looks so delicious.)

107
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,580
What?

108
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,500
Oh.

109
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,140
I tried my best

110
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,060
to talk to him.

111
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,660
But Mr. Liu said...

112
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,900
- What?
- He said

113
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,620
he'll get the girls anyway.

114
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,860
That jerk!

115
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,540
How dare he?

116
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,200
(Xiaoqiao wipes her)

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,900
(hand in this way too.)

118
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,470
Have a look.

119
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,940
He's still...

120
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,540
You must be Mrs. Gu.

121
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,500
Hello.

122
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,700
How much do you
know about us?

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,300
You know him?

124
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,140
(He is testing me.)

125
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,620
(I did something wrong?)

126
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,780
No.

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,220
Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,460
May I ask your name?

129
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,660
I am Shen Su,

130
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,060
the fastest constable
in Suzheng Office.

131
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,020
Hello, Mr. Shen.

132
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,980
I'll wrap it up for you.

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,890
- Trinkets!
- Take care.

134
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,820
He seems close to you.

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,140
(He is only close to)

136
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,500
(Shen Su and Xiaoqiao.)

137
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,900
(Is she...)

138
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,900
We'll just give the girls to Mr. Liu,

139
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,580
take them
away halfway.

140
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,500
Then tell everyone Mr. Peng did it.

141
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,260
Hmm.

142
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,420
Okay.

143
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,900
Mrs. Gu, you're finally back.

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,500
Calm down.
What happened?

145
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,460
Hua Pianpian of
Wuzhai Tribe is here.

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
Hua Pianpian?

147
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,260
What is she doing here?
