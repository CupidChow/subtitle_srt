00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,560
As the saying goes,

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,800
don't judge

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,280
a person by his appearance.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,080
You changed your appearance,

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,040
so what?

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,120
You're still a gangster.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,300
Chen Bai.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,880
I can kill you any minute!

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,960
Kill me.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Go ahead. Kill me!

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,240
Kill me! Kill me!

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,000
Chen Bai, tell you what,

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,720
Yunjiang City is mine now.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,960
And it will always be mine.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm not a gangster.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm not.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm not a gangster.

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Wuhui.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Wuhui, what's wrong?

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
- I'm not!
- Are you okay?

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,560
Are you okay?

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm fine.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
Just had a nightmare.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm fine.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
Help me up.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,720
Guard!

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Yes.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,480
Tell others.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Get ready to attack Qingfeng Village.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,280
We'll do it today.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Copy that.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,320
Wuhui, you've not recovered yet.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
Why not do that a few days later.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,760
I'll send some people from

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Wuzhai Tribe to help you.

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm fine.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
I'll do this.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
You!

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,240
What's wrong with you?

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,900
You gave Hua Pianpian
to our enemy?

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,880
What were you thinking?

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
You didn't tell me
they know each other.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
I thought if I did that,

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
there'd be no war.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,320
How can you think this way?

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,840
Alright.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,880
Calm down.

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,240
We should find a way to

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,640
beat Liang Wuhui now.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,480
Lord Chu,

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880
Chu Yan escaped last night.

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,790
We can't find him.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,080
Got it. You may leave.

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Yes.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Gu Qingdai saved him.

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,230
Oh no.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,000
He has all constables and Qingfeng

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
gang members now.

61
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
It's fine.

62
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,520
I'll destroy them all together.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,320
But...

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Hua.

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,160
I didn't have power before

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
because Jia had military talisman.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,920
Now he's dead.

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,840
I had it.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
I have an army that can

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,400
destroy a city easily.

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,520
I can totally do this.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
But

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
I feel something is wrong.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Wuhui,

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,840
or...

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,560
you don't have to destroy Qingfeng Village

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
and be City Lord.

78
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,920
We can leave here together

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
and start a new life.

80
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
Hua!

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,400
You forgot how we lived before?

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,560
We were starving and bullied.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,960
That's all because we're not powerful.

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,760
After I swapped my face,

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,680
no one

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
ever disrespected me.

87
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,490
And I'm extremely wealthy now.

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,280
I promised you,

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
I'll give you the best.

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Don't worry.

91
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
I'm with you.

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
I'll protect you.

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,120
Come here.

94
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,840
After I destroy them,

95
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,540
we'll never be apart.

96
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,440
(Loyalty, Justice)

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
Liang Wuhui will send

98
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
large numbers of

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
troops and attack our village today.

100
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,680
It's urgent now.

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
Constables will work with gangsters.

102
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,160
As long as we work together,

103
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,000
we'll beat them.

104
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
All my people

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,880
will follow your order.

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Xiaoqiao,

107
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
we're also under your command.

108
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,940
(Qingfeng Village Map)

109
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,760
You can't blow up these roads.

110
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,360
You can blow these places up.

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,200
But we have to blow this place up.

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
Shen Su. Go to put a bomb there.

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,240
Hmm.

114
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
This road leads to...

115
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,240
- Come with me.
- Mr. San.

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
Go to put some bombs here.

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,800
Walk along the edges.

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,520
Copy that.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
Let's go.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
What should I put in it?

121
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,920
2 spoons of this. And this.

122
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
This one. And this one.

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,240
I can put more in it.

124
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,920
What did you do?

125
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,920
Put 3 spoons of this and this.

126
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,000
It'll be more powerful.

127
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
It'll explode! Run!

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Run!

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
Uh.

130
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,560
Is it this powerful?

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,880
Just a mistake.

132
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,960
You guys!

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,840
- Quickly! And do it right!
- Be careful.

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,680
Okay.

135
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,680
Put the bombs in the right places.

136
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
- Let's go.
- Right there.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
There. There.

138
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Okay.

139
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,080
Move! Move!

140
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Be careful.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Be careful.

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,480
Put some bombs here.

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,520
- And there.
- Okay.

144
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
Quickly.

145
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,750
Okay.

146
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,320
Put it here.

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
- Be careful.
- Need two people here.

148
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,480
Okay. Coming.

149
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,970
Need more here.

150
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,400
You should calm down.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,120
Take a deep breath.

152
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,320
Hold your breath and focus.

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
Shoot.

154
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,160
You made it!

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,640
Xiaoqiao,

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,480
I know it'll be hard.

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,160
But don't put much pressure on yourself.

158
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,920
I'll be with you.
Don't worry.

159
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,760
I'll be with you

160
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,400
whatever happens.

161
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,640
Hmm.

162
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,160
It's finally coming.

163
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,360
The climax.

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,900
Lord Chu,

165
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
I...

166
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,800
I can finally avenge you today.

167
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,780

168
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,480
Chief.

169

Liang Wuhui and his people are coming.

170
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,680
Do as we planned.

171
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,520
Copy.

172
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,520
I just go to get

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
military talisman.

174
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,330
Hey.

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,960
You can't go there!

176
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,240
Mr. San,

177
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,400
go to start the battle

178
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,120
and lure them in.

179
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Okay.

180
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,720
I will retreat on purpose.

181
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,920
I can't beat them anyway.

182
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
You guys!
Come with me!

183
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,600
Wait a moment!

184
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,400
Retreat as soon as you can.

185
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Don't forget it!

186
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,120
I know! I know!

187
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,400
Hurry! Hurry!

188
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,180
(Qingfeng Village)

189
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
You're coming?

190
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Guys, go!

191
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,820
(Qingfeng Village)
