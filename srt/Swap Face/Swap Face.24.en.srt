00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,400
What are you doing?

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,640
I am the City Lord.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,880
You can't keep me here!

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,000
Stop it! You're a gangster.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,800
I am the City Lord.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,280
Let me out!

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,640
I'll kill you!

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,960
Let me out!

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,730
Guard!

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,640
Yes.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,300
Take the city guards here!
Take this!

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,480
Obey my order!

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,560
No one can leave the city today,

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,240
(Yunjiang City)
no matter

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
who asks.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,920
Copy that.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
Liang Wuhui.

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,240
You won't beat us today.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,880
You knew?

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,720
You're dead!

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
It's over.

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,480
Chu Yan.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
How can you do this to me?

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,120
I hate my history.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Why do you keep reminding me?

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,600
Okay then.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,400
I'll kill you now.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,560
Stop!

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,840
I can shoot you.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
I can shoot you.

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,960
Xiaoqiao!

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Chief!

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
- Let go of me!
- Don't move!

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm the City Lord.
Let go of me!

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Don't move!

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
Du Chong,

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
why did you...

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
You may not know,

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,520
I gave Gu Qingdai to Liang Wuhui.

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,240
I owe this to her.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,040
You have her face.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
May you live a happy life.

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
Du Chong!

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Du Chong!

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
Liang Wuhui!

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
You tortured me

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,320
for years!

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
I'll kill you today.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Stop it!

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Let go of me!

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I'll kill you!

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
You kept me for years!

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll kill you!

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,760
I'll kill you!

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
Chen Bai,

58
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,840
you're guilty of murdering

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Lord Jia.

60
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,160
You'll be executed.

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,600
I can't believe I didn't kill Liang Wuhui.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,240
But Lord Jia was guilty
of several crimes.

63
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
He got what he deserved.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,560
And you were wrongfully

65
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
imprisoned for years.

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,640
You're free now.

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,120
You set me free?

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,920
I didn't expect I can get justice here.

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,400
From now on,

70
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,620
as long as I'm in charge,

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,600
there will be no more corruption here.

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,480
Thanks for doing this.

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,640
I also want to tell Miss Gu

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,000
something.

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,820
What?

76
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
You can tell them you killed him.

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,800
So

78
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,440
my mom didn't kill Lord Chu.

79
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,760
Liang Wuhui did it!

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Chief.

81
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
What about Liang Wuhui?

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,440
Put him

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,880
in prison forever.

84
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,540
(Loyalty, Justice)

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,000
Mr. San!

86
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,040
Guys! On your feet!

87
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,400
Please!

88
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
I'm the leader now.

89
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,120
There will be some new rules.

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
From now on,

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,840
everyone here can't

92
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,840
commit crimes

93
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,490
or do evil things.

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,040
We'll start a legitimate business,

95
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,560
like farming,

96
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
or starting an

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,680
armed escort company.

98
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,060
(Loyalty, Justice)

99
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
But,

100
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Mr. San,

101
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,920
we have something urgent to do.

102
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
What?

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,800
Find me a wife.

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
Come on!

105
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,190
Su Xiaoqiao!

106
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Yes!

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,280
Take the Qingyun Badge,

108
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
you'll be an official constable.

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
Keep this in mind,

110
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,760
always be brave, impartial, upright,

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,560
and protect the justice of law.

112
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,190
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,940
(Qingyun)

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,640
I finally made it.

115
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,240
Thanks, Chief.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,880
What?

117
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,480
Chief.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,720
Chief.

119
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm only your Chief?

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
- Let's go.
- Then...

121
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
Then what should I call you?

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,680
We've got married!

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,000
But it was a fake

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,920
wedding.

125
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,960
(Fake?)

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,320
(Is he)

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,480
(mad at me?)

128
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,210
(I sure am.)

129
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,600
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,240
- Kiss!
- Come on!

131
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,880
What are you doing?

132
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,760
Why is it

133
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
a fake wedding?

134
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,720
Then...

135
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Then I'll call you

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
Chu...

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
Chu Yan.

138
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm your husband.

139
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,320
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

140
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,680
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

141
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
What's that smell?

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,840
- Oh no.
- Oh no! My turtle!

143
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,640
It's delicious. Thank you.

144
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Chief!

145
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,680
Liang Wuhui escaped!
