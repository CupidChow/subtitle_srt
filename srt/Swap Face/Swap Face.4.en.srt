1
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,580
- You sure?
- Yes.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,100
I saw a man walking past

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,940
when I was near leader's room.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,300
This is his.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,500
(Suzheng Office)

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,260
=Swap Face=

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,260
=Episode 4=

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,990
(Qingfeng Village Map)
Found Xiaoqiao?

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,830
No.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,310
She is

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,590
killing me.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,030
I shouldn't have let her do that.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,830
Find her

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,110
as soon as possible.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,470
Got it?

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,590
Yes.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,470
Right,

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,230
Gu Qingdai seems to

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,670
know a lot about us.

20
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,030
Find out her background.

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,510
And I can't go to the office lately.

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,270
Please help handle it.

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,630
Copy that.

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,510
Right. Chief, take this.

25
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,150
What's this?

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,790
I got it from the

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,830
Goddess Temple.

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,390
Wish you have a baby soon.

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,700
(Feng)

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,150
What are you doing?

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,430
It's sunny tooday.

32
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,430
And I want to take a walk.

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
Besides,

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,430
we just got married.

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,310
We're supposed to

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,870
be together all the time.

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,870
Huh?

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,150
It's not gonna happen.

39
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,710
Mrs. Gu! Mrs. Gu!

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,230
Mrs. Gu!

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,590
Mrs. Gu,

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,270
Mr. Du brought some men

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,750
and they wanted to buy girls here.

44
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,470
What?

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,830
Buy girls?

46
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,990
Sweetheart.

47
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,150
Come with me, okay?

48
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,950
Give Mr. Du 100 liang.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,270
Hey!

50
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,350
How can you do this

51
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,870
without telling me?

52
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,830
Huh?

53
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,710
100 liang?

54
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,870
That's it?

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,980
Take a look.

56
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,750
They're all

57
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,910
stunningly beautiful.

58
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,150
- Yes, yes.
- Look at them.

59
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,840
- And her.
- They're nice.

60
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,230
At least 300 liang.

61
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,110
But

62
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,390
we've agreed...

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,630
Mrs. Gu is the leader.

64
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,350
She has the right.

65
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,570
What's this?

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,790
Mrs. Gu, why
did you say that?

67
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,910
You knew about this.

68
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,110
Mr. Peng has already

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,390
given us 100 liang.

70
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,230
Right.

71
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,780
You've taken it.

72
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,920
Ah.

73
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,590
Mr. Peng, calm down.

74
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,990
It's not that I won't sell them.

75
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,590
It's just,

76
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,230
these girls

77
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,750
are sick.

78
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
What?

79
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,550
It's true. See?

80
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,870
Look.

81
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,470
Look at this.

82
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,910
Here.

83
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,510
- What happened?
- Look.

84
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,550
You're sick too?

85
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,430
Is it contagious?

86
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,110
Is...

87
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,750
They're really weak.

88
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,030
They can't travel now.

89
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,710
How about this,

90
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,310
I'll help take care of them.

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,430
You can come after they're recovered.

92
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,270
Fine.

93
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,590
Take care.

94
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,430
Hey.

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,880
Help yourself.

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,230
This tastes nice.

97
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,510
Mr. Du, please.

98
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,190
Are you serious?

99
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,910
Mrs. Gu said that

100
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,110
only girls can have the delicate food.

101
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,870
Sorry abou that.

102
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,270
(My favorite!)

103
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,180
(Feng)

104
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,190
Why did you invite me here today?

105
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,510
I have some doubts about

106
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,990
things happened recently.

107
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,750
So I want to talk to you.

108
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,110
I got it wrong?

109
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,030
Or you did it on purpose?

110
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,030
(What's he really up to?)

111
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,750
If I'm wrong,

112
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,310
we can make it clear.

113
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,110
In case something

114
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,670
worse happened.

115
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,870
It'd be a disaster.

116
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,590
Mrs. Gu.

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,110
Try some of this.

118
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,710
(Roast chicken!)

119
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,150
Since you put it this way,

120
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,150
I'll just stay for a while.

121
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,590
Please.

122
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,270
Mrs. Gu.

123
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,990
Please.

124
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,750
Cheers.

125
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,590
What?

126
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,790
You think I put drug in it?

127
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,150
No, no.

128
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,870
My husband said

129
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,750
that it would be inappropriate if

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,910
I drank with other men.

131
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,350
But we drank together

132
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,470
all the time.

133
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,110
Don't you remember?

134
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,900
(Several days ago)

135
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,510
Hold on.

136
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,030
You can give me whatever I want?

137
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,910
Of course.

138
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,700
Especially what Qian Feng

139
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,600
couldn't give you.

140
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,990
Hold on.

141
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,550
You didn't even know what I want.

142
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,390
What do you want?

143
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,030
I want you to marry me here

144
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,430
and give me a grand wedding.

145
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,630
(Gu Qingdai offers to marry Du Chong?)

146
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,550
(I have to leave now.)

147
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,870
(Or he'll find out.)

148
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,430
I've got something to do.

149
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,510
I got to go.

150
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,030
Mrs. Gu.

151
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,910
I still want to talk to you.

152
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,230
It's late.

153
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,510
Why not sleep with me today?

154
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,910
You asked to do this all the time.

155
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,070
Stop it!
