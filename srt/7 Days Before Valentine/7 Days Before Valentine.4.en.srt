1
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,574
I know who I will ask you to erase tonight.

2
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,200
Earth?

3
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:15,784
Wrong!

4
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,244
Then who do you want me to erase tonight?

5
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:18,995
Mek.

6
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:19,913
Mek?

7
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:20,955
Who is Mek?

8
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,207
Rain's ex-boyfriend

9
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,125
I...  have someone else.

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,754
After Rain started dating me, there was news that Mek disappeared.

11
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,507
So, when he broke up with Rain, it was to save Rain.

12
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,177
If someone really did make him disappear, those people are evil.

13
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,347
But you... you're going to make the world forget that he ever existed.

14
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,681
You're even more evil!

15
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,141
I wish to...

16
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,723
10.00 AM. 9 February 2023

17
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,254
Good morning, today is the 9th of february 2023

18
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,633
it will be five days until valentine's.

19
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,969
I'm here to deliver Rosie.

20
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,223
Rosie

21
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,271
Your place looks cozy

22
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,273
a bit dark though

23
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,276
Rosie will be confused whether it's day or night

24
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,403
let her sleep a bit more.

25
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:03,243
When you take her to your boyfriend she will rise on time.

26
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,412
Erm, thanks.

27
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,001
Hey, that's Mary and Nancy.

28
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,965
How come they're still here?

29
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,008
you didn't give them to your guy?

30
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,386
Yes I did

31
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,304
but he puts them in a vase for me every night.

32
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,726
Oh I see.

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,479
I shall bother you no more, rest well.

34
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,271
If that guy Earth has disappeared

35
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,857
then things should be back to as they were.

36
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,113
Q!

37
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,035
Q!

38
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,995
Are you here?

39
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,162
Where have you been?

40
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,292
Why?

41
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,752
Did you miss me?

42
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:19,921
Yeah right.

43
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,423
Or did you think I'd ghost you?

44
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:25,927
Here

45
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,762
I got you some food.

46
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,514
Eat. I'll prepare it.

47
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,265
Where did you go?

48
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,100
Far.

49
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,021
You get up late everyday so you never see Bangkok in the morning

50
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,238
you still haven't showered or brushed your teeth have you?

51
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,740
get to it.

52
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,454
Hot soy milk, I've warmed it up.

53
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,999
And what are you having?

54
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,876
Yok lor.

55
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:00,837
What's that?

56
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,588
You wouldn't know of it.

57
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,757
Hurry and eat.

58
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,884
You want something else?

59
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,389
Did you like taking care of others

60
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,811
while you were human?

61
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,487
Not at all.

62
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,701
I didn't even have the chance to

63
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,081
no wait

64
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,126
I lost the chance more like.

65
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,216
What about you? When you were with Rain

66
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,927
did you take good care of him?

67
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,354
Not really

68
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,441
Rain took care of me.

69
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,654
I was always busy, Busy working and studying.

70
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,198
Supporting myself until I graduated.

71
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,283
After that I auditioned for a lot of jobs.

72
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,662
Which didn't leave much time...

73
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,707
for us.

74
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,754
And when you finally realized...

75
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,922
But I made a plan

76
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,092
to stop taking jobs for a month, book the flight, get the hotel

77
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,803
I wanted to surprise him. Take him to see snow.

78
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,897
And look what he did.

79
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:46,901
Don't blame him.

80
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,157
You didn't look after him.

81
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,957
So I want another chance

82
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,130
from now on I will care more, be attentive

83
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,259
I won't be annoyed when he wants Beef pad kaprao

84
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,512
I won't get into politics and I will -

85
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,346
Okay, fine...

86
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,269
as a matter of fact

87
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,814
if we appreciated the one chance that we had

88
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,030
then we wouldn't beg for another one

89
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,740
am I right?

90
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,455
Right, Just get to it, why wait.

91
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,916
This dessert here is my favourite.

92
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,418
Hurry up.

93
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,129
and try.

94
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,052
Here, take it.

95
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,561
Don't worry

96
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,646
you still have a change.

97
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,635
Hey Sunshine

98
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,806
Who have you been giving roses to everyday?

99
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,642
My boyfriend.

100
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,394
I haven't seen him lately

101
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,652
I thought you got a new one.

102
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,322
We're still very much in love, Sis

103
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,658
And what about you Q?

104
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,576
Don't you have someone to be with other

105
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,746
than hovering around a guy who is already taken?

106
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,539
No one at the moment, Norma.

107
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,959
But saying I Hover around makes me feel like I'm a ghost

108
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,297
I'm sorry, my Thai is not so good

109
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,679
who would dare say you're a ghost

110
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,722
But if a “divinity” now we're talking.

111
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,434
So, Norma, what are you up to?

112
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,604
This footprint on the wall

113
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,314
I just can't erase it.

114
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,775
You studied art right? Any advice?

115
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,530
You better ask Q.

116
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,241
Q, Can you help her erase it?

117
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,159
I gotta go.

118
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,791
You're good at erasing?

119
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,793
Erm...

120
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,797
somethings gets messier the more you try to get rid of it.

121
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,757
I think you should leave it

122
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,551
it looks artsy, like a wall that has  history.

123
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,221
My, you do have a way with words.

124
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:03,973
Maybe...

125
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,518
I should let you...

126
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,689
leave some history on...

127
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,569
the wall also.

128
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,238
With... pleasure, but right now

129
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,657
I must get going... right away

130
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,576
Be seeing you.

131
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,129
Wait up.

132
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,923
How could you leave me behind? So cruel.

133
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,008
What?

134
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,179
She was interested in you, so I gave you the opportunity.

135
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,433
Geez, she must have missed breakfast, and wanted a quick snack.

136
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,102
Are you gonna follow me around again?

137
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,105
You're afraid people will get the wrong idea like Norma did?

138
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,608
‘Cos you're all on me like a possessive spirit.

139
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,736
It's my duty to look after you.

140
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,281
But who knows...

141
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,576
maybe today my duty might be over.

142
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,995
I'm more than certain of it.

143
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,164
I checked Rain's IG today

144
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,333
no Earth, no Air

145
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,668
everything back to the way it was

146
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,879
as if the clouds have parted

147
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,049
and the sun is back to shine.

148
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,554
What a refreshing new day.

149
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,240
Busy day right?

150
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,284
Your idea is a success, Nat.

151
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,081
Happy chocolate day.

152
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,291
Thanks.

153
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,545
A special recipe I came up with for you to try first.

154
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,594
Wow, it's rich, Yum.

155
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,556
The seven days before Valentine all have a special meaning.

156
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,476
The first is the 7th, day of the rose.

157
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,355
I thought the roses were just for the 14th.

158
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,108
No, the next day is the day of confessing your love.
And the next day is chocolate day.

159
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,234
And what day is tomorrow?

160
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,320
The 10th is Teddy day.

161
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,280
I've already prepared a cute bear menu.

162
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,117
I could never come up with this. How could we survive without you?

163
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,244
I'm not going anywhere

164
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,579
I promise.

165
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,041
And what is the 11th day?

166
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,334
The day of promises.

167
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,126
12th

168
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,461
Hug day

169
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,337
13th

170
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,423
Kiss day... and then it's...

171
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,349
Welcome, happy chocolate's day!

172
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,978
What would you like sir?

173
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,440
Is this a joke?

174
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,113
Then...

175
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,367
can I have something special then?

176
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,245
Then I recommend chocolate.

177
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,621
It's chocolate day today.

178
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,373
Can I have your name?

179
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,212
Why are you asking?

180
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,589
You know your boyfriend's name

181
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,592
What do you mean?

182
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,177
I don't have a boyfriend.

183
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,221
Come on

184
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,931
This is not funny.

185
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,977
I'm sorry, My friend made a mistake...

186
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,978
What the hell, man?

187
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,563
Stay out of this.

188
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,401
This isn't a prank show like candid camera or something like that right?

189
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,737
A prank show?

190
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,905
Why do you think this is a prank?

191
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,200
Because I don't know who you are.

192
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,086
You're not thinking about jumping are you?

193
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
This height won't kill me.

194
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,219
Well if you really died, you would regret ever doing it.

195
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,553
You've done it before?

196
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:33,529
I get how you feel. Loss makes us feel like life has no purpose.

197
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,744
Here, have some. I got it for you.

198
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,246
What is this?

199
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,165
Chocolate lava. Happy chocolate day

200
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:46,959
Darn it!

201
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,418
Calm down

202
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,879
It was just two people in two nights.

203
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,882
You're lucky you have five more chances.

204
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,634
It's not working

205
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,510
It is NOT WORKING.

206
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,303
You can see this is not working.

207
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,222
Your wishes are not working.

208
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,976
Not only he is not coming back to me, he doesn't even know who I am

209
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,227
Alright

210
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,021
then I'm okay knowing you won't jump

211
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,901
because you're not blaming yourself but rather that my wishes don't work.

212
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:13,902
Or is that not true?

213
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,029
Okay

214
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,408
why don't you come on down

215
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,627
Rain's chocolate is kinda good.

216
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,005
You never tried before?

217
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,300
I thought he just sold coffee

218
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,343
I don't like his coffee, it's sour.

219
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,220
You are just...

220
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,222
and you blame me.

221
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,265
forget it.

222
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,143
let's go over there.

223
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,070
Why you won't admit that it doesn't work?

224
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:57,863
Hey

225
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,950
I told you I have the duty to grant you wishes

226
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,244
but I can't foresee the outcome.

227
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,371
Which means you know the outcome.

228
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,332
I can just work it out

229
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,250
without using superpowers

230
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,588
I told you that you're smart but you lack wit.

231
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,883
You were too excited about the special power you have

232
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,428
the power to erase anyone you want

233
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,889
but could you use it to make someone love you

234
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,599
you should think about it.

235
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,854
Trying to connect all the dots

236
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,982
between the things we have and the things we want is so complicated.

237
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,651
I thought it would be easy

238
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,113
just erase this person, that person and I'll get Rain back.

239
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,325
But now I know it's harder than I thought.

240
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,455
The more you erase the more trouble you make.

241
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,749
Then...

242
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,127
can the divine gentleman tell me

243
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,214
how come I erased Mek and Rain doesn't know who I am?

244
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,216
When did you first meet Rain.

245
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,759
At a bar, why?

246
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,135
Tell me what happened.

247
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,473
I went to that bar five years ago.

248
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,016
Who did you go with?

249
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,104
By myself

250
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,648
I studied acting and needed material.

251
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,402
I had just broken up with someone - thought I was heartbroken.

252
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,862
But it was just puppy love.

253
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,331
Right, and you're all grown up now.

254
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,126
Don't interrupt

255
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,838
I sat over there.

256
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,554
The music was playing.

257
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,389
I looked around

258
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,684
there weren't that many customers.

259
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,228
Then I saw Rain

260
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,356
sitting with a woman.

261
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,611
Don't tell me he was seeing a girl...

262
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,405
No...

263
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,615
her name was Meen, his friend.

264
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,617
She was the singer at the place

265
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,162
she went up to sing.

266
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,848
We traveled past each other from different planets.

267
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,394
On a cold night

268
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,814
We met again.

269
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,528
Will it be time, fate, or trepidation?

270
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:51,078
that brought you and me Let's be together here.

271
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:57,542
And when the sight Let's coordinate

272
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:04,633
our universe Move in and overlap.

273
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:11,640
If we embrace without knowing

274
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:18,188
What will it feel like?

275
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:24,111
Experienced through the breath

276
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:38,875
Let us float away in this moment

277
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,239
You don't waste any time.

278
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,520
She's a great singer, do you know her?

279
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,898
She's a good friend of mine.

280
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,277
I wish I could sing like that, but I don't have the gift.

281
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,155
We're all gifted. Just not in the same things.

282
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
What do you study?

283
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,824
Acting.

284
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,243
There's your gift.

285
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,662
What about you, what do you do?

286
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,080
I run a cafe.

287
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,749
Making coffee is also a gift.

288
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,543
No

289
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,794
I hire people.

290
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,962
I don't know how to do.

291
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,382
I worked a regular job for a year and got bored.

292
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,841
I didn't like having a boss

293
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,803
so I quit and did my own thing. Gives me freedom.

294
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,263
Being your own boss.

295
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,265
I don't call myself that at my place

296
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,016
we're all colleagues.

297
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,440
You look like...

298
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,859
you have something on your mind.

299
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,445
It's nothing

300
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,574
I mean we can't be happy all the time.

301
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:16,866
Right?

302
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,288
If you want to talk

303
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,331
I'm happy to listen.

304
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,500
Thanks

305
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,876
but pay me no mind.

306
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,297
Why are you here alone?

307
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,091
To find material.

308
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,428
And have you found your material?

309
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,682
I think I have.

310
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,937
You're out at night often?

311
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,482
I can't afford it. Every once in a while

312
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,986
I don't have class tomorrow, just a shoot in the evening.

313
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,112
A shoot?

314
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,031
For an online clothing brand.

315
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,992
I work to put myself through university.

316
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,702
Good for you.

317
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,662
I respect that

318
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,248
people who work and study.

319
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,208
I couldn't do it.

320
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,127
I don't have a choice...

321
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,599
Do you like watching movies?

322
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,351
I...

323
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,144
watch some.

324
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,606
That means you're not into it.

325
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,859
Tell me when you get the lead role, I'll go see you.

326
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,569
I'm taking your word for it.

327
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,081
I don't really know what to say, not much of a talker.

328
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,125
Neither am I.

329
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,460
Oh really?

330
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,337
I thought actors were good at talking.

331
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,255
No, not all the time.

332
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,396
Ok, awkward.

333
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,482
What shall we talk about?

334
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,316
Yes

335
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,235
what should we discuss...

336
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,656
Why are you here on your own?

337
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,158
To see my friend...

338
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,577
and...

339
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,913
I don't have anyone to bring

340
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:28,957
How about your partner?

341
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,045
We broke up.

342
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,382
Sorry.

343
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,094
Hey, it's fine.

344
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,099
This is what's on your mind

345
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,517
right?

346
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,947
To be honest...

347
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,743
I broke up with mine too.

348
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:05,910
Oh, hey

349
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,996
sorry to hear that.

350
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,706
It's okay

351
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,542
my story isn't as serious as yours.

352
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,587
My partner got accepted into an agency to star in a series.

353
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,338
But no relationships allowed.

354
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,051
What's that face for?

355
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,637
It's normal.

356
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,931
If a celeb has someone then their popularity will drop.

357
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,393
No, It's just in this day and age...

358
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,689
I leave you alone for a bit and you already got a new friend.

359
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,358
Hey Meen, this is...

360
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,526
Sunshine.

361
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,237
What a nice name.

362
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,157
Nice to meet you, sunshine.

363
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,576
Your singing is awesome.

364
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,245
thank you, are you here on your own?

365
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,455
Yes, I am.

366
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,707
Don't tell me...

367
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,250
you're heartbroken.

368
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,630
Not broken, just a normal breakup, my ex got a new job.

369
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,342
His ex is going to star in a series...

370
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,517
He's an actor, looking for material.

371
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,985
After that, as Meen joined us, we had a blast.

372
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,446
Rain was more relaxed.

373
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,991
Meen was worried about him.

374
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,080
We stayed there till closing time. We went for a meal afterwards

375
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,292
and then Rain took Meen home and then me

376
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,795
but that was it.

377
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,130
Okay, I get it.

378
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,466
What about you, you get it?

379
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,342
Get what?

380
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,721
Because Rain broke up with Mek, he went to that bar and met you.

381
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,473
If he didn't break up with Mek

382
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,643
he wouldn't be heartbroken over that song and go cry in the toilet

383
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,522
which was where you met him and handed him a Handkerchief.

384
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,940
To sum it up

385
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,360
If no Mek then you two would never meet.

386
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,453
So...

387
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,873
that means we would never know each other

388
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,209
I would just be another stranger to him.

389
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,462
But you still have the opportunity to win his heart.

390
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,755
Wanna try?

391
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,050
Which means...

392
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,635
I have to begin again.

393
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
Yes.

394
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,682
Should you choose this opportunity to begin again

395
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,060
or should you use the power to erase someone entirely.

396
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,150
You still have five days

397
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,110
till Valentine's.

398
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,466
Have you ever bargained for anything?

399
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,218
I'm sure you have

400
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,639
for the price of something

401
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,768
If it's not the right price

402
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,854
then we're not buying.

403
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,358
Or maybe...

404
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,362
we haggle out of custom

405
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,407
because if we're definitely going to buy it

406
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,577
then I don't know

407
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,707
why we haggle in the first place.

408
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,005
Or perhaps.

409
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,177
we bargain of our benefits.

410
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,142
this is where it gets difficult.

411
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,237
Because if both sides do not benefit

412
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,658
and someone loses out

413
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,291
and who wants to lose out

414
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,462
definitely not me.

415
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,681
So now...

416
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,100
what am I bargaining for?

417
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,396
Who is this man in front of me

418
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,732
and how will he benefit?

419
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,028
He wants me to choose between the “opportunity”

420
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,738
to start again

421
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,032
and the “power”

422
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,784
to erase anyone I want

423
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,248
to make my life easier...

424
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,293
It's as if he can read my mind.

425
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,966
I feel totally naked, nothing to hide behind

426
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,054
his eyes know my thoughts

427
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,850
sometimes mocking me.

428
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,439
I'll tell you this - life is hard.

429
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,776
For me?

430
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,153
I know nothing about him.

431
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,368
He may be naked

432
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,455
but there seems to be something shielding him.

433
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,085
His eyes reflect sadness

434
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,545
that he never reveals

435
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,341
due to the rules of heaven.

436
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,018
This is going to be epic.

437
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,064
So do you just let yourself in and out whenever you want?

438
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,402
Sorry, I feel as if it's my home now.

439
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,155
Then let's split the rent.

440
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,990
And what are you up to?

441
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,871
Relationship diagram analyzing situations and relations between ma and Rain in detail.

442
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,124
So I can get to the real reason like you said.

443
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,506
So you're choosing this instead of the chance to begin again.

444
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,009
this is a chance

445
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,720
I still have 5 more tries and five nights right?

446
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,056
I have to warn you about something.

447
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,683
Go on.

448
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,268
It's important

449
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,145
so listen carefully.

450
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,646
Just say it already.

451
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,983
This is a good opportunity to start again.

452
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,486
But if you are choosing that... You cannot return after you do this.

453
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,780
That's right

454
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,574
I get the rules.

455
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,118
It's the point of no return.

456
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,995
But if it doesn't work

457
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,415
I can still return to the point where Rain breaks up with me right?

458
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,462
some people... are just hopeless, like really.

459
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,297
That's why we're people

460
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,343
and not a cupid reaper like you.

461
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,303
Yeah? and what would you do?

462
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,680
I would just tell them what to do to be happy

463
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,558
none of this seven nights, seven times thing

464
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,101
do you think this is fun?

465
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,937
That's why my title is cupid reaper!

466
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,398
If I could do that I'd have to be born as a full fledged cupid

467
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,817
And I wouldn't have to take people's lives to fulfill your wishes

468
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,194
do you think this is fun?

469
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,167
Looks like the cupid reaper is in a bad mood today.

470
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,424
Can you tell me, what got your panties in a twist?

471
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,767
Are you mad at me? What did I do? I wasn't aware.

472
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,939
You're never aware.

473
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,483
It's a waste of opportunity.

474
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,570
The opportunity to start again?

475
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,365
Rain doesn't even know me anymore.

476
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,075
How long will it take for me to -

477
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,702
Rain not knowing you is good.

478
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,954
You can start a new bond with him.

479
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,831
It's your chance to prove yourself -

480
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,626
You told me I have five more tries so what's wrong with choosing this?

481
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,839
You don't dare to prove yourself. You don't have the courage to try. You're waiting for a miracle

482
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,216
- let me tell you that miracles don't exist.
- And do you have any miracles?

483
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,343
I don't see any darn good coming from you. All you're good at is talking crap.

484
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,514
- There it is, this is your true colors, this is who you really are.
- What? What are my true colors? What kind of person am I?

485
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,559
Blaming others, you never look in the mirror and see yourself. You never admit to your own faults.

486
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,393
I see myself in the mirror everyday.

487
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,644
But after you occupy my bathroom

488
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,523
I don't get the chance to. You annoy me with all your bathing.

489
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,360
You see? There it is Blame, blame, blame, blaming everyone else.

490
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,278
So what? So what if I blame others?

491
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,323
That's why Rain can't stand you, It's not just your boyfriend leaving you

492
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,284
Not a soul on earth would waste time on you.

493
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,633
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,550
Get out.

495
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,194
I want to be alone.

496
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,099
Are you... and Sunshine just friends?

497
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,058
Oh, yes of course.

498
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,895
All this time, I've never met any of his friends.

499
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,772
And... I haven't seen his boyfriend lately.

500
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,776
Tell me, who do you want to erase next?

501
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,696
From the relationship diagram.

502
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,200
We began arguing because of...

503
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,409
this

504
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,827
Politics.

505
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,954
I understand that this issue is...

506
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:39,705
Yes

507
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,207
dangerous.
