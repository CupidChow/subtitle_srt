1
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:19,621
I wish that whoever is in the way of Rain not returning to me to disappear from this universe.

2
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,791
that person is then…Rain

3
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,335
I've erased him.

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,253
It feels so empty,

5
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,714
not even a memory

6
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,133
What else will he have to face?

7
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,260
What will I face?

8
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,763
You don't want him to go through what you did right?

9
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,014
Then help him,

10
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,682
but...

11
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,601
don't forget about the rules.

12
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,279
Q

13
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,200
Do you think this is the right way?

14
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,203
It's inevitable.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,206
Why does it have to be Rain?

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,083
Because…

17
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,004
You wished to erase whoever that is in the way of Rain returning to you.

18
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,133
And that is Rain himself

19
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,009
Correct.

20
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,222
He doesn't love me anymore

21
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:26,229
or maybe he never loved me in that way from the beginning.

22
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,357
People change all the time.

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,734
There must be a reason for these changes

24
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,408
And that reason is something I never saw,

25
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,578
something I overlooked all this time

26
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,084
and that reason is me.

27
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,672
Finally…You've learned your lesson.

28
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,801
I've erased all those people that had nothing to do with this

29
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,013
but I couldn't see the real problem.

30
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,350
Sometimes the truth is hard to accept.

31
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,269
But it isn't fair.

32
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,478
How so?

33
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,273
If I am the reason for all this

34
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,860
then why does Rain have to vanish. Why isn't it me?

35
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,697
I am the reason that Rain is not returning to me.

36
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,118
I really can't answer your question.

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,252
The rule of uncertainty?

38
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,172
It isn't fair.

39
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,176
Remember, we have two more days.

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,721
You still have a chance with two more wishes.

41
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,143
Chance…I've already messed up.

42
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:53,233
I blew it thinking I have the power to make people fall in love with me,

43
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,322
but really I've just been making people disappear.

44
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,662
The more you erase the more trouble you make.

45
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,707
I'm glad that you're aware.

46
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,917
And what about you?

47
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,919
Me? what?

48
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:19,008
When I've learned my lesson then your mission is complete?

49
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,844
It's not as simple as that.

50
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,971
So how?

51
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,682
What is your real purpose here?

52
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,644
When I lived here on this earth like you,

53
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,190
I never asked myself what my real purpose in life was

54
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:41,239
but now at this moment it's useless to ask what that purpose is.

55
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:49,664
All I know is that the cycle will go on and on…never ending.

56
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,082
Like Sisyphus.

57
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,458
Who is Sisyphus?

58
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,170
A man who was cursed to push a giant boulder up a mountain.

59
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,967
Day after day he would push the boulder up to the top

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,344
but then it rolled back down and crushed him.

61
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,973
It went on like this everyday, never ending,

62
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,354
until his face became cold and emotionless,

63
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,649
he was almost one with the boulder

64
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,779
but inside you couldn't tell how he felt.

65
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,574
How come I've never heard this story?

66
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,577
It's like me never having heard of your tragic river tale,

67
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,621
even though these stories come from the same place.

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,209
We can't know everything.

69
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,006
Faust sold his soul to Mephistophilis

70
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,362
Like I've sold my soul to you.

71
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,370
And now you've obtained the knowledge.

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,082
You've finally learned…

73
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,588
And you?

74
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,467
How long do you have to suffer this?

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,848
This absurdity.

76
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,816
Yes

77
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,027
it's so absurd.

78
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:52,829
Life, death, our existence defined by the higher power

79
00:06:54,414 --> 00:07:00,545
Maybe it's God or whatever up above.

80
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,589
When all has passed,

81
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,426
when all is too late,

82
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,053
then we realize,

83
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,060
every minute is the opportunity

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,189
that can be so much and that we cannot get it back again.

85
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,948
We cannot get it back if we just let it pass by.

86
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,629
Can I be alone for a while?

87
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,634
Go have some time to yourself,

88
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,387
I'm okay alone.

89
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,765
I've always been alone.

90
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:23,938
Pissed off?

91
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,608
Being angry at me won't help.

92
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,694
We just follow orders.

93
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,112
And who is in charge?

94
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,531
Tell me, I'm not afraid of him, where is he,

95
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,156
tell me -

96
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,783
No one has seen him!

97
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,371
No one knows what the “order” looks like.

98
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,251
The order comes from way up above me, who knows how high it goes,

99
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,171
our duty is to -

100
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,256
Duty?

101
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,429
And can you deny it?

102
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,099
You agreed to it.

103
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
I never agreed to it.

104
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,229
You didn't know that you did,

105
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,065
you never saw your first mistake,

106
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,943
making every step the wrong one.

107
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,696
Then why did we trick him into making the same mistake as ours?

108
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,328
It's the rules you think you can win that easily without obeying the rules?

109
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,039
But your rules are inhumane, I never had the chance -

110
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,834
They're not my rules and stop saying you didn't have the chance.

111
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,673
Here it is, your chance,

112
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,800
right here

113
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,219
and now,

114
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,681
isn't this what you want?

115
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,857
Yes,

116
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,777
I begged for the chance,

117
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,572
but it's going to…

118
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,949
happen like it did before

119
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,579
Have you tried your best?

120
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,000
Did you make the best out of the chance you were given?

121
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,795
Listen,

122
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,717
that night...

123
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,845
I could have sent you anywhere

124
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,100
that wasn't that kid's place like you asked.

125
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,731
It could have been anybody that you didn't know,

126
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,403
didn't care about like the rest of all those lives

127
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:42,034
that meant nothing to you,

128
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,877
so I used my powers,

129
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,089
powers that I have

130
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,468
to give you what you want

131
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,640
and now what are you moaning about?

132
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,852
You came to the future from the past

133
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,773
just to throw everything away?

134
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,027
Come on, get up, boy,

135
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,532
go do what you must to get the job done,

136
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,994
Don't you want to win?

137
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,552
Sunshine, Don't!

138
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,599
Q

139
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,976
Don't sit there, it's dangerous.

140
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,705
My memory…of Rain,

141
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,336
is disappearing every second.

142
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,556
I don't want him to disappear, do you understand?

143
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,269
I don't want to forget him.

144
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,659
Let's go downstairs.

145
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,461
You were worried that I would jump?

146
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,630
Well it looked worrying.

147
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,927
If I was going to do it, I wouldn't do it that way.

148
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,305
Whatever way you just shouldn't do it.

149
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,642
But I don't want to go on living without a piece of Rain to hold onto,

150
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,690
not even a memory.

151
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,735
Let's say,

152
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,447
If I died,

153
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,283
what would become of your mission?

154
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,201
Will you be punished?

155
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,995
Don't say that.

156
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,288
Answer me.

157
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,846
I'm being punished now.

158
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,352
The order that they gave you,

159
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,522
what happens when I make all seven wishes?

160
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,195
And what happens if I don't make all seven wishes?

161
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,864
There are more conditions.

162
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,074
What are they?

163
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,492
Well…

164
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,662
If you wise up from your first wish

165
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,750
or choose to start all over again from the point where you erased Mek

166
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,211
and Rain never knew who you were…

167
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,754
What would happen?

168
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,214
I would win.

169
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,389
But I never learn…

170
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,267
It's funny,

171
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,230
my life is just a game for the gods to bargain with.

172
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,733
So what do you get if you win?

173
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,489
I don't know.

174
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,824
You don't know?

175
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,079
Pathetic.

176
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,582
You're in the same situation as me.

177
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,882
You try so hard to win and when you do, you get nothing

178
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,803
but the same suffering that just goes on.

179
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,014
Never ending.

180
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,479
So then,

181
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,358
now I know that I'm the reason that Rain is not coming back to me,

182
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,070
I've learned, so now you win.

183
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,908
No,

184
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,746
because we passed those two conditions.

185
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:26,086
Which means there are more conditions

186
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,549
What are they?

187
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,137
I can't say,

188
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,973
It's' against the rules.

189
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,226
Meaning...

190
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,687
You have to complete all seven wishes.

191
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,033
This kills…

192
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,120
this is killing me.

193
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,254
Well...

194
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,301
Let's go outside.

195
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,930
Maybe we can jog your memory.

196
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,199
Where are we going?

197
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,493
Just roam around.

198
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,705
Incase you remember a place you used to go with Rain.

199
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,005
Anything?

200
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,724
I just remember his name,

201
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:33,398
But the memories of him are all fading.

202
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,656
Even if he appeared among these people,

203
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,992
I wouldn't know if it was him.

204
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,581
And the saddest thing,

205
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,963
I remember that I loved him so much…

206
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,175
Q

207
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,305
My love for him, will that disappear too?

208
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,642
I can't say.

209
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,194
You know…

210
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,782
It hurts even more than unrequited love.

211
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:30,831
Like in life - values and meanings

212
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,252
that you try to figure out and think you finally get it

213
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,090
but then it gets erased,

214
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,925
all gone,

215
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,261
nothing left,

216
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,432
as if life before now is just emptiness.

217
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,893
I understand.

218
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,026
I think I get it

219
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,780
but I don't.

220
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,956
What universe am I in?

221
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:18,170
I feel so empty, confused

222
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,631
how did it come to this?

223
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,677
I'm really here right?

224
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,597
Do I really exist right now?

225
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,517
And what will I have to face tomorrow?

226
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,862
Let's go over there and see what those people are doing.

227
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,081
People will never know.

228
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,127
we thought we knew better.

229
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,716
Question with everything in the sky

230
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,930
Assign meaning to fate

231
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,310
That person is so big.

232
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,815
To see what's around it

233
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,444
I want Air to disappear from this world!

234
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,281
If someone really did want Mek to disappear that person has to be so heartless.

235
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,702
You are going to make the world forget that he ever existed, You are even more evil.

236
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:37,499
According to the relationship diagram, we started having problems because of him

237
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,960
Do you really want me to erase Pathai Pitakseri?

238
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,129
It looks like you ready to grant my wish

239
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:43,839
Mean.

240
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,090
You are so heartless.

241
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,176
Well, I can't go back the other night and correct my mistake

242
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,637
It wasn't just that night, you messed up from the beginning.

243
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,722
Just shut up and do as you're told!

244
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:57,060
I want whoever it is that is the way of Rain returning to me

245
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,563
To disappear from this universe

246
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,357
And that person is…Rain.

247
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,866
Forget to look at the diversity of life.

248
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,034
How much do you see?

249
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,079
What do you know?

250
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,206
Damrong.

251
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,178
Meaning, I once set out on a journey to find meaning of life,

252
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,722
the whole universe, and death

253
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,391
What will you get? I'm Damrong, not Einstein.

254
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,935
But I never searched for the meaning of the name Damrong.

255
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,563
But I will wonder what is causing the confusion.

256
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,232
Why must there be black and then white? There must be ups and downs.

257
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,943
The more I thought about it, the more I asked, the more I realized that the more I didn't know, the more confused I became.

258
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:52,699
Just live with pride until the last day.

259
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,965
I want to treat you to a good meal, what do you want to eat?

260
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,176
Whatever that tastes good.

261
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,595
How about that place?

262
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,016
I'm okay with street food, it doesn't have to be a restaurant.

263
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,060
Come on, a special meal.

264
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,244
How's your lamb chops?

265
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,914
Tender, they do it well here.

266
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,795
What about you? Not eating?

267
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,547
Not hungry.

268
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,882
You'll get drunk drinking on an empty stomach.

269
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,595
Have some bread,

270
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,306
here.

271
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,568
Do you come here often?

272
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,239
I'm no big spender,

273
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,658
just for special occasions.

274
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,910
Did you bring Rain here?

275
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,796
I might have

276
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,175
but I can't remember a thing.

277
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,811
I'm sorry.

278
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,982
It's okay.

279
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,448
Do I really have to make two more wishes?

280
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,368
Yes. Two more.

281
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:02,912
Why?

282
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,083
Are you getting used to not remembering him?

283
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,959
Who says?

284
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,464
I told you

285
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,969
that not being able to remember him hurts even more.

286
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,307
You still have two chances. Two nights.

287
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,731
Two more nights…

288
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,569
it will be valentine.

289
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,822
Yes.

290
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,828
I hope I can make it through Valentine's

291
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,084
‘Course you can.

292
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,212
This game just gets harder.

293
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,051
I have to erase people…for what?

294
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,720
For Rain to come back to you.

295
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,144
But I can't remember him.

296
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,778
Do I have to erase those who are in my way?

297
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,831
It looks like it.

298
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,294
But you already realised that the people you've erased …

299
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,176
sorry to say this, were all innocent.

300
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:48,643
Which means the rule is you can erase whoever

301
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:55,483
and my duty is to make it happen without question.

302
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:01,239
And do I have to make the wish at my place?

303
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,658
You can do it wherever.

304
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,661
And your costume,

305
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,998
do you need to change?

306
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,124
What costume?

307
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,880
That cape thing you put on before I make my wish,

308
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,842
is that your reaper uniform?

309
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,261
I'm not sure,

310
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,806
I might turn into the reaper in that uniform for you to see.

311
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,934
That's your true form right?

312
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,104
I want to see it.

313
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:39,527
Actually, You might see me in that costume because of the light.

314
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,824
You change according to the light?

315
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,911
It's just the lighting and what we see.

316
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,748
You might have added a part of what you are in what you see.

317
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,627
So you're saying it's all my imagination.

318
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,130
Come on, don't try to make sense of everything,

319
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,883
let's just say,

320
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,221
It doesn't matter about the costume, I'm at your command.

321
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,521
Then...

322
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,566
I want to make the wish somewhere different.

323
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,380
This is beautiful.

324
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,010
Bangkok,

325
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,137
city of paradise

326
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,767
where people struggle to make it hoping one day

327
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,104
they will be well off like the angels.

328
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,536
Do you remember the story

329
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,789
I told you about the boy, Who was deserted?

330
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,041
I remember.

331
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,960
Do you want to hear more?

332
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,047
Yes, if you wish to tell it.

333
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,271
That boy grew up,

334
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,650
he knew he was different from everyone else, he wasn't perfect like the others,

335
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:49,991
so he wished that one day he live in the high places, like all the angels in this city

336
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,123
but the best that he could do was a room in a run down building

337
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,584
that sunlight doesn't reach.

338
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,796
He kept telling himself, one day…

339
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:05,590
one day

340
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,216
May I interrupt?

341
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,176
What is it?

342
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,765
I think I like the room in the rundown building where sunlight can't reach.

343
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,683
It has character,

344
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,769
I don't know,

345
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,898
maybe that boy doesn't know he already made his slice of heaven,

346
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,986
not everyone can live high up like the other angels in this city,

347
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,365
No one is happy with a room that they don't own.

348
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,536
Day after day I chase my dreams,

349
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,624
like Sisyphus who pushes that rock up the mountain,

350
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,710
but it just rolls back down and crushes us,

351
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,337
until we get used to it,

352
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:49,300
and no longer notice the inequality between humans and angels.

353
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,552
Same for that boy,

354
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,889
he has someone he loves

355
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,562
but he still chases his dreams in the city of angels,

356
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,526
so he neglects the value

357
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,322
of the people around him

358
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,534
until...

359
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,913
he loses what he had.

360
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,624
But he still believes in fairy tales,

361
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,753
he still hopes that it will end with a happy ending.

362
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,798
With an angel that will grant his wishes.

363
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,217
Yes,

364
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,887
an angel appears and grants his wishes

365
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,644
but it's not that easy.

366
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,530
Nothing in life is easy - not even in a fairy tale.

367
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,491
Not even in a fairy tale.

368
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,456
The angel granted him wishes,

369
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,377
he could erase anyone so that his loved one can come back to him.

370
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,506
He has seven chances in seven nights, before valentine.

371
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,383
He was sure

372
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,511
that he didn't need all seven chances,

373
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,805
he needed just one.

374
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,809
If he could just erase the right person…

375
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,230
but...

376
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,443
once wasn't enough,

377
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:39,744
night after night he erased people around him,

378
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,582
the more he wished the messier it got,

379
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,879
his loved one got further

380
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,882
and further away,

381
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,306
until there was nothing…

382
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,109
And then one night…

383
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,322
up in the high heavens of the angels,

384
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,700
the heavens that he could only dream of,

385
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,163
the boy who kept messing up

386
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,834
decided no more mistakes,

387
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,464
The two chances he had left,

388
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,470
he didn't need to use both of them

389
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,014
just one,

390
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,438
he wanted one more wish.

391
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,234
Do you want to know what the boy wished for?

392
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,610
I do.

393
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,572
And do you know the reason the angel that chose to see him

394
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,782
Does not want him to make that wish.

395
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,827
But the rule is

396
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,121
you can't deny my wish right,

397
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,497
Q?

398
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,583
Sunshine, Please.

399
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,750
I've decided.

400
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,545
It's the only way to wash away my sins.

401
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,129
Sun -

402
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,380
Whatever bargain you made with him,

403
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,633
whoever that person is,

404
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,052
the person that is up above,

405
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,267
Earlier you told me I've already went past my crucial point,

406
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,978
but there are still more conditions that you won't tell me about,

407
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,733
who knows, maybe this is the keypoint that will unlock those conditions,

408
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,027
so that we both could be free,

409
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,237
No.

410
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,781
I as a human

411
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,451
and...

412
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,329
you as..

413
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,040
you as..

414
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,586
whatever you are, let's just say both you and I -

415
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,884
Hey, are you sure you don't need to change into that reaper costume of yours?

416
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,385
Oh, Sun

417
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,028
But we abide by the rules of uncertainty,

418
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:21,822
so what

419
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,953
if I bet my life on that uncertainty.

420
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,376
Okay, what time is it?

421
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,213
Oh, I forgot,

422
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,507
my phone already beat me to the afterlife.

423
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,884
I don't have a watch.

424
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,763
Probably near midnight.

425
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,598
Another risk I have to take…

426
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,809
But it doesn't matter,

427
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,979
the good thing about this city of paradise is

428
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,731
that the angels are always celebrating.

429
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,192
To whatever occasion,

430
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:03,739
whether it's Thai, foreign, birthdays weddings,

431
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,034
funerals,

432
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,124
someone is bound to be celebrating something,

433
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,503
like the sound of laughter that dies down

434
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,299
and begins somewhere else,

435
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,014
same for the sound of weeping,

436
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,268
and this is the benefit of being so high up

437
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,895
you get to see it all.

438
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:42,987
Q…

439
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,280
Yes…

440
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,951
I'm really...

441
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,912
bad aren't I?

442
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,251
You despise me, right?

443
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,920
No, not at all,

444
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,505
why would I hate you?

445
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,341
I'm such an awful person,

446
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,301
stubborn,

447
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,054
self centered,

448
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,890
selfish.

449
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,725
We're only human.

450
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:19,065
I'm sorry for everything.

451
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,567
You didn't do anything wrong.

452
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,612
And also thank you...

453
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,157
for everything.

454
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,624
There, it begins,

455
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,210
you see it? City of paradise,

456
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,213
somewhere, Someone is celebrating.

457
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,238
It's time,

458
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:09,949
Q.

459
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,954
I wish…

460
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,420
To erase

461
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,048
myself from this universe.

462
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,233
In the morning of the 13th of february.

463
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,068
I saw Rain.

464
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,820
I saw Air

465
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,781
and the other people in his life.

466
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,911
Everything was reseted to the way it was because I was erased from the universe.

467
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,164
I see life as how it should have been.

468
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,501
I saw people enjoying life like they should,

469
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,004
I can feel their joy.

470
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,672
I have succeeded.

471
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,925
I have cleared the mess I made.

472
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,636
I've brought them all back to happiness.
