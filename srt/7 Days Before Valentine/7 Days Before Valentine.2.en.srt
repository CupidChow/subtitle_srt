1
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,237
Let's break up

2
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:11,988
Why?

3
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,781
because of what?

4
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,282
Is it someone else?

5
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,117
this dull face is the guy?

6
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,536
Stop it!

7
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,913
It's who you are!

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,081
you can't love anyone

9
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,582
because you only love yourself!

10
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,502
Did you do the right thing?

11
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,669
You're a good guy.

12
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,088
Whoever doesn't see it, it's their loss.

13
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,339
I won't accept it!

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:29,756
Hey!

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,131
Hey!

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:30,673
Hey!

17
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,883
I am the grim reaper

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,011
I'll give you the opportunity to 'erase' any obstacle 7 times.

19
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,933
I want that guy 'Air' to disappear from this world!

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
=Episode 2: Revenge=

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,957
What are you looking at, Dad?

22
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,292
These tangerine branches are overgrown.

23
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,921
Tomorrow I'm going to climb up and trim them.

24
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,925
No. Dad

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,635
you can't.

26
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,097
What if you slipped and fell?

27
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,683
Oh, come on, it's just nothing

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,852
Let me exercise a little.

29
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,354
Or else I'm going to die of boredom.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,898
I have only one Dad

31
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,819
Once I finish my exams tomorrow, I'll come back and do it myself.

32
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,571
You can be my assistant.

33
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,614
Is it your last exam, right, son?

34
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:37,991
Yes, Dad.

35
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:38,950
Criminal law.

36
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,246
Oh, Dad

37
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,832
my advisor asked me today

38
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,709
if I wanted to become a professor at the faculty.

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,752
Really?

40
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,171
That's great for you

41
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,630
So, what did you say?

42
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,133
I told him...

43
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,843
I'll think about it.

44
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,178
Why?

45
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,929
it's a great opportunity.

46
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,431
What do you need to think about?

47
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,434
The advisor said

48
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,144
if I wanted to be a professor

49
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,730
he would find scholarships for me to study abroad.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,065
But I don't want to leave you, Dad.

51
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,442
Air

52
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,154
you've done a lot for me already.

53
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,948
Do something for your future, son.

54
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,701
If I go

55
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,494
who will stay with you?

56
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,705
Your health is not so good.

57
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,166
Even if I'm sickly

58
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
I'm still a tough old man.

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,295
I won't keel over that easily.

60
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,049
I want to see your success.

61
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,345
Let's talk about this later.

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,057
It's late, come inside.

63
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,484
Today, Rain told me that you dissapeared.

64
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,152
He was really worried.

65
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,488
He promised to walk me home

66
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,615
but I didn't want to bother him.

67
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,784
Our house is just right around the corner.

68
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,994
I walked to his café alone

69
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,913
so why can't make it back?

70
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,124
Well let him know next time, Dad.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,168
He was quite busy.

72
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,087
He has a lot of customers now.

73
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,965
What a kind-hearted man.

74
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,468
What about you

75
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,970
not going to bed yet?

76
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,720
not yet.

77
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,764
I'm gonna read for a while.

78
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,183
I'll prepare breakfast for you

79
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,643
in case you're not awake yet.

80
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,978
Go read then

81
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,979
so you can go to bed soon.

82
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,397
Goodnight, Dad.

83
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,440
Love you.

84
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,900
Goodnight, son.

85
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,861
Remember

86
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,115
Air, you are the 'air'

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,451
that I breathe.

88
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,797
10.00 AM. 8 February 2023

89
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,981
Good morning, Sunshine.

90
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,774
I brought Nancy as you asked.

91
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,484
Nancy?

92
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,365
Thanks.

93
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,617
I'm was gonna bring her in the morning

94
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,785
but Tae-Tae told me that...

95
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,704
you won't be awake till late.

96
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,913
Tae-Tae?

97
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,290
The shop owner.

98
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,000
Tae-Tae was right

99
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,043
you really wake up this late every day?

100
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,548
Well, look how drunk I was last night.

101
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,467
Where did you go to get drunk??

102
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,551
What?

103
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,094
At your shop of course.

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,512
My shop?

105
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,224
Last night, you ordered flowers and didn't come back.

106
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,602
What?

107
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,189
Was I that drunk, or are you delirious?

108
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,651
I know I'm not quite like regular folks

109
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,403
but I'm never drunk

110
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,364
and my clarity is intact

111
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,534
Have a good day, sir.

112
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,577
Take care.

113
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,663
Hey, wait.

114
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,539
wait.

115
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,682
Good morning, Sunshine.

116
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,017
Would you like a cup of coffee?

117
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,561
Hey erm - are...

118
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,980
you... a real person?

119
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,158
I'm not real

120
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,622
but I do exist.

121
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,541
Go on, touch me.

122
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,502
That's my towel!

123
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,090
Do you want me to stand here naked until I'm dry?

124
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,853
I... I..

125
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,021
I'm not drunk...

126
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,606
I'm not dreaming...

127
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,441
It doesn't get any more real than this.

128
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,152
Well then...

129
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:31,881
Air

130
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,674
That dull face is really gone.

131
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,593
Really gone.

132
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,929
I've erased him

133
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,987
as you ordered, sir.

134
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,663
Unbelievable!

135
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,457
Mr. Q, I'll do anything for you.

136
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,334
I'll repay you for everything.

137
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,127
That bland guy is gone from this world

138
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,587
and Rain is still my boyfriend.

139
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,006
I'm going to see Rain.

140
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,092
Wait

141
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,094
I suggest maybe take a shower first?

142
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,096
You fell asleep like this last night.

143
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,515
I had to carry you from the balcony to this bed.

144
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,933
You're so heavy

145
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,184
and also very smelly.

146
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,560
Well...

147
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,020
then I'll shower first.

148
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,566
You can think about what you want to eat.

149
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,778
you've eaten human food before right?

150
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,034
I saw you drinking coffee earlier

151
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:46,747
Hey

152
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,749
Why are you standing there? I'm taking my pants off.

153
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:49,750
Why?

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,751
Then take them off.

155
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,878
If you're shy, take them off in the bathroom.

156
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,005
This is my room.

157
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,258
Why should I have to take them off in the bathroom?

158
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,051
Well, suit yourself.

159
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,221
They say...

160
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,974
to take off your clothes when you see a ghost

161
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,225
to scare them away.

162
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,477
Aren't you scared?

163
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,771
I'm not a ghost

164
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,982
or a demon.

165
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
I am the Cupid Reaper.

166
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,570
I'm not scared.

167
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,536
You're really not scared.

168
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,707
It's you who should be afraid of me

169
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,169
mortal.

170
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,825
Can you wipe it off?

171
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:47,910
Huh?

172
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,536
No, I can't.

173
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,870
Why are you following me?

174
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,413
Go somewhere else.

175
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,250
Don't you want to see how the humans live in this city?

176
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,584
You can't follow me around.

177
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,503
If someone sees you, I'll tell them who you are.

178
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,464
I want to go see my handy work.

179
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,882
No one can see me

180
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,050
believe me.

181
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,526
Good morning, Big sis, Nom.

182
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,654
Redecorating the lobby again?

183
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,780
Sunshine.

184
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,991
It's for Valentine's Day.

185
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,411
But I don't know who left their footprint on the wall.

186
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,162
Must be those peeps last night.

187
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,247
So rude!

188
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,582
Look!

189
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
Iit's not coming off.

190
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,543
Just paint over it.

191
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,044
Sis.

192
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,090
Then the room will completely lose its classic look.

193
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,467
Hey, Sunshine

194
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,094
I wanted to talk to you about something.

195
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,220
What is it?

196
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,848
Your next door neighbor and the other tenants

197
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,268
have been complaining all morning that you got drunk last night

198
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,477
and made so much noise they couldn't sleep.

199
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,520
Is that true?

200
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,899
Uh, well...

201
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,442
Well..

202
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,527
Did you hear it?

203
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,323
I sleep with earplugs.

204
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
Even if all hell breaks loose, I wouldn't know.

205
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,368
But watch it, okay?

206
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,745
I don't want problems with the neighbors.

207
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,539
Sure, sis. I'm sorry.

208
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,711
And who's that?

209
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,964
You said no one could see you.

210
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,009
His aura is glowing like that

211
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,677
how can I not see?

212
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,263
Uh...

213
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,765
he's my friend.

214
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,224
His name is...

215
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:34,725
Q.

216
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,937
Hello.

217
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,396
I'm Norma.

218
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,943
Nice to meet you. Norma.

219
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,112
I'll make sure to remind Sunshine not to get drunk and make a ruckus.

220
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,697
Thank you.

221
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,574
If you fancy a drink sometime

222
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,284
feel free to come to my room

223
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,536
both of you.

224
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,998
Thank you.

225
00:15:59,166 --> 00:15:59,875
So...

226
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,002
I'll excuse myself now, sis Nom

227
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,753
I mean...

228
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,504
Norma.

229
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,297
I'm in a rush.

230
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,009
Have a good day.

231
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,139
Are you finished yet?

232
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,057
I can't -

233
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,725
Keep do it.

234
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,775
You said no one could see you.

235
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,609
I don't know.

236
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,403
I thought no one could see me except you.

237
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,655
This is news for me too.

238
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,908
Aren't you hot

239
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,159
all dressed-up like that?

240
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,869
Of course I am.

241
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,582
Where are they going?

242
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,169
Crossing the river to the other side.

243
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,587
Can we get on?

244
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,797
I want to try the ferry.

245
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,590
No. I can't swim.

246
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,800
Let's take a car.

247
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,760
You said I could ask you for anything.

248
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,139
Well, yeah, maybe another day.

249
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,559
Hey!

250
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,860
Have you heard the story about the tragic river?

251
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,864
it's a greek mythology

252
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,287
they compare death to crossing the river.

253
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,754
Some can't pay the price to cross so they spend hundreds of years waiting.

254
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,968
Only heroes can travel back

255
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,971
and forth from hell to the human realm.

256
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,316
You want to return to this world, don't you?

257
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
But I'm no hero.

258
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,466
Hey

259
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,218
but you're here now.

260
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,220
Let's go

261
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,253
Rain wants to know if the 'Yok lor' is ready?

262
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:49,920
Oh

263
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,171
that uncle is here again?

264
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,297
Didn't see him come in.

265
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,257
Didn't see him come in.

266
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,341
How are you, Uncle?

267
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,509
I'm fine.

268
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,469
I'll let Preaw make 'Yok lor' for you.

269
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,720
he will come out and serve you.

270
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,347
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,724
Rain is so kind.

272
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,393
He never makes him pay

273
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,020
and this Thai-style iced coffee isn't even on our menu.

274
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,276
Wow...

275
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,111
Nat, new pastries?

276
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,321
They look delicious. Can I try one?

277
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,698
No!

278
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,908
I set yours aside in the kitchen.

279
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,584
Thank you.

280
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,502
Please feel free.

281
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,005
You guys must be tired.

282
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,464
So many customers today!

283
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,550
No, It's better to have a lot of customers

284
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,010
you make more money

285
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,428
and I get paid

286
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:41,847
Here.

287
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,182
“Yok lor”

288
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,851
a special drink for a special customer.

289
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,728
Preaw, serve it to him.

290
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:58,989
Hey, Rain.

291
00:19:58,989 --> 00:19:59,615
Hmm?

292
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,283
Sunshine...

293
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,996
You wait outside.

294
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,789
What do you want to drink? I'll go order.

295
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,583
Iced Americano.

296
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,713
Thank you so much.

297
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,771
What's this for?

298
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,231
Just a gift.

299
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:33,649
Oh.

300
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,779
Give me one hot Americano.

301
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,864
I thought you didn't like the coffee

302
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,242
It's for a friend.

303
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,537
Is that your new date?

304
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,538
He's handsome.

305
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,998
Come on, he's a friend

306
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,041
you kidding?

307
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,710
Sorry, I thought you had a new date for real.

308
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,421
Wait, how can I have a new date?

309
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,090
When the two of us...

310
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,424
Let's go talk over there.

311
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,442
Sun... I'm sorry.

312
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,986
It's okay.

313
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,946
I didn't have much time for you either

314
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,155
I've thought about it.

315
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,448
It's also my fault too

316
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,450
that I let our relationship turn out like this.

317
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,994
I said it's alright.

318
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,372
I admit that when I first met you

319
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,082
I was pretty broken.

320
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,876
So when I met you

321
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,046
I thought we had something in common...so I -

322
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,006
Hey, come on

323
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,012
But time proved that...

324
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,680
we have nothing in common.

325
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,890
How can we be the same in every way?

326
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,186
You used to say that you like the diversity in this world, right?

327
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,813
Yes...

328
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,189
but for a relationship -

329
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,482
Let's start over again.

330
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,693
Like brothers.

331
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,820
I promised

332
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,905
I'll be a good brother to you. Forever.

333
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,574
What brothers?

334
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,617
How can we be something else when we are lovers?

335
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,912
We are trying to understand each other and start a new, right?

336
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:11,788
Sun...

337
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,290
can't you let it go?

338
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,917
Let it go? Let go of what?

339
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,587
I thought you were okay about it and just came to see me.

340
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,672
I thought you got over it.

341
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:21,590
Oh

342
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,675
how? when -

343
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,885
Sun. Listen.

344
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,681
I told you last night that I still love you

345
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,850
but it's not the same kind of love anymore.

346
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,102
One day, I woke up

347
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,937
and I was worried about you

348
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,984
like an older brother worried about his younger brother

349
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,987
like a friend who wished the best for his friend.

350
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,157
It's because I really care about you

351
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,119
but it's not that same feeling of love I had before.

352
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,038
The old feeling of missing you

353
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,581
yearning to see your face

354
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,541
to be close to you

355
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,418
to talk about things

356
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,337
to live together...

357
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,506
I guess I've gotten used to it...

358
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,634
to how

359
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,553
you were never here for me.

360
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,662
Rain

361
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,163
who's this?

362
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,208
“Finally I've found you, My Valentine”

363
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,252
It's Earth

364
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,546
my new boyfriend whom I told you about last night...

365
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,935
Liar!

366
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,019
Why did you lie to me?

367
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,604
Wait, wait, what lie?

368
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,440
You said you erased Air, right?

369
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,732
I didn't lie.

370
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,734
I erased him as you said.

371
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,903
Then why is that guy, Earth, there instead?

372
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,405
You're losing your mind again.

373
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:09,948
You said...

374
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,783
you're the “Cupid Reaper”

375
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,536
who had the power to bring Rain back to me.

376
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,329
You fraud!

377
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:22,377
I never said I have the “power” to bring anyone back to you.

378
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,839
What I can do is to “erase” anyone as you command.

379
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,091
Whoever you think is an obstacle

380
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,510
whoever you think if you eliminate them

381
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,511
will make Rain come back to you.

382
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,053
There...

383
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,054
There...

384
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:33,805
you just said it.

385
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,557
I told you to “think”

386
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,602
about who to choose to “erase”

387
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,061
so that it will make Rain come back to you.

388
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,771
You might have made the wrong choice

389
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:42,939
or -

390
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:43,857
Erase the wrong person?

391
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,692
How can that be?

392
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,154
That's why I told you to use logic and reason.

393
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,449
Do you see now? That even if you erased Air, he still has Earth.

394
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,826
Then just tell me who do I have to erase?!

395
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,454
Sun

396
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,957
Rain asked me to return this.

397
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,808
Darn it!

398
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,149
What the hell?

399
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,152
Why don't you look where you're going?

400
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,862
I almost hit you! Do you want to die, man?

401
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:31,988
accept my apologies young man.

402
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:32,989
Sorry my ass!

403
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,950
If I hit you, who's gonna be responsible?

404
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,286
Are you alright, Uncle?

405
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,793
It's fine. I wasn't careful

406
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,045
You don't just walk onto the road like that

407
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,548
Stay home where you belong old man

408
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,757
Have some respect!

409
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,051
He's an elderly! He's older than your father!

410
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,345
If someone talks to your father like this, how'd you feel?

411
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,805
Nat, Preaw, call the police!

412
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,306
No, please don't.

413
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,349
It was my fault.

414
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,269
I walked in front of his motorbike.

415
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm really sorry.

416
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,898
See?

417
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,525
Just get the hell outta of here!

418
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,693
And don't let me see you again!

419
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,635
Are you sure you're okay?

420
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,886
No

421
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,305
it's nothing really.

422
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,515
Where do you live, Uncle?

423
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,017
He visits here every day.

424
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,727
I'll have someone take you home, Uncle.

425
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,644
It's fine.

426
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,187
my home just right here.

427
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,106
I can walk home myself.

428
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,816
No, please. I'm worried.

429
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,193
I can't lose an important customer like you, Uncle.

430
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,238
Oh...I caused such a mess.

431
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,949
I was lost in thought for a moment.

432
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,492
Next time...

433
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,578
I'll be more alert.

434
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,292
Thank you for your concern.

435
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,669
I'm so sorry.

436
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,047
Preaw

437
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,256
walk him home.

438
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,426
I said it's okay. Go back to work, kid.

439
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,386
Come on, Uncle. Don't be stubborn

440
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,562
I was watching him drinking his coffee

441
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,397
it happened all so fast.

442
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,149
He lives around here?

443
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:31,900
Yes

444
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,318
a regular customer.

445
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,486
I felt sorry for him.

446
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,571
He's all alone, no children.

447
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,966
Do you know

448
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,636
why that old man doesn't have any children to take care of him?

449
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,398
Because I erased his son from this world.

450
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,082
Do you think Rain can hear you?

451
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,006
Why did you follow me?

452
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,967
To see how long you're going to stay angry

453
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,135
I'm more than angry.

454
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,303
I'm going crazy.

455
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,220
So...

456
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,346
if you realize

457
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,015
then why let emotions get the better of you?

458
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,559
Because I'm only human.

459
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,436
A man with flesh and blood

460
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,230
unlike you, an inhuman with no heart.

461
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:35,899
Okay.

462
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,025
So, even without Air

463
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,276
Rain still won't come back.

464
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,196
You still have a chance to erase 6 more people

465
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,405
6 times

466
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,615
6 nights.

467
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,366
I'll erase -

468
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,451
Wait...

469
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,285
not now.

470
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,161
It's not the time.

471
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,496
Wait til tonight.

472
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,873
And also

473
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,125
you have time to think carefully.

474
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,294
Use your head...

475
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,170
Alright

476
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,129
fine

477
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,881
I'm tired of listening to you.

478
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,257
Use my head

479
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,175
be reasonable.

480
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,802
I'll see you tonight.

481
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,135
Hey

482
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,804
where're you going? let me tag along

483
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,055
No. We part ways.

484
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,016
Part ways?

485
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,602
We're weren't even a thing yet.

486
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:13,937
Don't mess around.

487
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,523
Show me around... please.

488
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,732
I'm not in the mood.

489
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,027
I didn't want you to be in that “mood” with me either.

490
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,238
Just go away!

491
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,583
Thank you so much.

492
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,094
It's good that we get to close early

493
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,428
so we can all rest.

494
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,846
It's been a long week.

495
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,181
Not really tiring.

496
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,767
The more customers we have, the more motivated I am.

497
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,354
During the pandemic, our shop was in a bad way.

498
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,107
Thank you so much for not leaving me.

499
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,192
You can believe in me.

500
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,777
I'm not going anywhere.

501
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,156
you know that?

502
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,409
You're more than just a coworker to me

503
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,038
You are like my...

504
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,791
Family.

505
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,795
Alright then

506
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,464
let's finish closing the shop.

507
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,258
I need to get going

508
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,342
I have an appointment

509
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,261
Go ahead. I got it here

510
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,764
Rain, you have a date, right?

511
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,265
Stop it.

512
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,433
So fresh and dapper.

513
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,018
Stop it.

514
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:41,853
See you.

515
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,947
take a picture, why don't you?

516
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,365
Clear the tables so we can go home.

517
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,658
It's done.

518
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,659
Hey

519
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,371
your pastries were so delicious.

520
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,789
Please save me some more tomorrow.

521
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,540
Greedy boy.

522
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,375
I'm giving you a compliment.

523
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,334
Nat

524
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,588
I think you could open your own café with your skills.

525
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:13,968
Or you can easily work at a famous one that pays really well

526
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,639
Money isn't important as a peace of mind

527
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,725
and that is doing what we love

528
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,101
and following our dreams.

529
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,436
True.

530
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,979
I have something to ask you.

531
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:25,855
What is it?

532
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,858
I want to pursue my own dreams too.

533
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,692
What?

534
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,860
What do you mean?

535
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,236
I want to be a dancer.

536
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,863
But you can't dance.

537
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,239
But I am passionate.

538
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,492
I can't dance well now

539
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,118
but if i practice

540
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,245
I'll get better one day, right?

541
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,789
So what?

542
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,873
You'll quit and go practice dancing?

543
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:44,874
Do you think it's a good idea?

544
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,834
I study and work

545
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,211
and it takes up all my time.

546
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,754
How do I find time to practice?

547
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,882
How about you dance while you're serving?

548
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,884
I've seen it in western movies.

549
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,220
The lead actor serves and dances at the same time

550
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,388
Pretty cool.

551
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,057
Then you also have to make coffee while dancing.

552
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:01,474
Oh

553
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,517
You're daring me?

554
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,142
I might do it

555
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,018
Let's go.

556
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,812
How about this?

557
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,319
Your turn.

558
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:27,917
Okay.

559
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,127
Enough of this.

560
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,213
Think about it

561
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,590
if you quit then who will replace you?

562
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,259
The shop is doing better.

563
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,885
Stay and help Rain.

564
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,971
He's always been good to us.

565
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,265
I think...

566
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,517
the reason you're not going anywhere

567
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,477
is because your heart...

568
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,479
is here with Rain, am I right?

569
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:49,647
Stop it.

570
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,758
Are you looking for someone?

571
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,178
No. I just happened to... I...

572
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,139
We met at the coffee shop earlier, didn't we?

573
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,682
Yes, that's right.

574
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,100
Ah, I thought

575
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,894
you looked familiar.

576
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,355
Thank you for your help.

577
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,732
And what brings you around here?

578
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,151
Who will you give the flowers to?

579
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,278
Nothing.

580
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,240
I... um... I came to visit a friend nearby

581
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,158
and happened to see you, Uncle.

582
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,078
Why don't you come in for a sip of water?

583
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,621
It's okay, Uncle.

584
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,039
I think I'll be heading back.

585
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,582
Heading back?

586
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,042
Where do you live?

587
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,461
I came...

588
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,047
from out of town.

589
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,632
I'm here temporarily.

590
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,467
And how about Bangkok?

591
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,094
Do you like it?

592
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,599
Why don't you

593
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,559
come in for a bit

594
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,436
if you don't mind my house.

595
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,855
Oh, of course not, Uncle.

596
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,121
Sometimes, it gets kind of lonely with no one to talk to.

597
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,665
I've taken a liking to you.

598
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,695
These flowers smell so good.

599
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,822
They're Japanese Honeysuckle.

600
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,783
I planted them since my wife was still here.

601
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,661
Now they're overgrown.

602
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,956
I want to trim it, but it's beyond me.

603
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,125
Do you need my help, maybe?

604
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,710
Oh, it's okay.

605
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,003
They're fine as they are.

606
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,006
The good thing about them is that they give off a fragrant scent

607
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,674
from dusk till dawn.

608
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,135
Sometimes

609
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,554
I sit here and reminisce

610
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,348
dozing off

611
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,225
until it's dawn

612
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,770
and it's time to prepare the alms for the monks.

613
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,272
The mosquitoes must have had their fill

614
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,191
Let them bite

615
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,318
fellow beings, sharing this world.

616
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,321
I don't have much to give anyone

617
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,698
only blood to donate to mosquitoes.

618
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,586
Do you go to that coffee shop every day?

619
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,715
The owner is so kind.

620
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,384
Well

621
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,843
I'll tell you a funny story.

622
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,596
When he opened the shop

623
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,432
I walk past the store every day.

624
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,977
It looked quite modern

625
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,897
and expensive

626
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,525
but there weren't many customers.

627
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,861
So, I decided to give it a try.

628
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,071
When I go inside

629
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,408
Oh, my, I didn't know which coffee to order

630
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,493
there's just so many fancy ones.

631
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,746
I told him I wanted a simple old Yok lor

632
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:16,664
you orderd Yok lor?

633
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,456
Yes.

634
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,794
The staff burst into laughter

635
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,838
but that guy, Rain, the owner

636
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,339
he's really nice to me.

637
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,384
He ordered the staff to make me that special menu.

638
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,510
So now

639
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,595
it's their “Yok lor” was a

640
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,014
“special menu” that only I can order.

641
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:35,766
It's so cute.

642
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,475
Yes.

643
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,814
And you...

644
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,653
being here... do you miss home?

645
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,911
I know who I will ask you to erase tonight.

646
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,982
If you had the power to erase anyone from this world

647
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,192
who would you erase?

648
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:08,901
Nonsense!

649
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,111
people change all the time.

650
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,530
Use your brain and think

651
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,739
When did things change

652
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:14,657
and why?

653
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,409
I know who I will ask you to erase tonight.

654
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:17,952
Earth?

655
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:18,577
Wrong!

656
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,912
That's surprising.

657
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,706
Will what I wish last night be the same as before?

658
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,167
Then who do you want me to erase tonight?

659
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,001
Mek.

660
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,002
Mek?

661
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,379
Who is Mek?

662
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,464
Rain's ex-boyfriend

663
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,675
before he met me.
