1
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,032
He doesn't love me anymore

2
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,284
and that reason is me.

3
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,411
Finally…You've learned your lesson.

4
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,537
And what about you?

5
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,456
How long do you have to suffer this?

6
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,749
We just follow orders.

7
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,084
And who is in charge?

8
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,376
No one has seen him!

9
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,545
go do what you must to get the job done,

10
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,713
Don't you want to win?

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,590
So what do you get if you win?

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,549
I don't know.

13
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,258
Pathetic.

14
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:37,222
My memory…of Rain, is disappearing every second.

15
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,684
I wish to erase myself from this universe.

16
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,587
Good morning, Sunshine.

17
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,649
I'm not dead?

18
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,735
No, You're not dead.

19
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,613
You didn't erase me?

20
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,491
I did erase you.

21
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,663
So…

22
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,708
why..did I return here?

23
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,713
There was someone that made a wish to save you.

24
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,592
Who…Who saved me?

25
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,762
Someone…from another dimension.

26
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,598
Who?

27
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,728
You will never know and I will never tell you.

28
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,624
I haven't seen a sunrise like this for a long time.

29
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,882
Isn't it beautiful?

30
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,886
Every morning the sun will always shine bright.

31
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,351
And I…am just a tiny human…

32
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,437
this big

33
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,153
A new day is here Sunshine.

34
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,656
The morning of the 13th of February, Before valentine,

35
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,994
I woke up one more time, I have a new life.

36
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,331
I get to see the sunlight in the morning that I haven't seen in a long time.

37
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:56,671
I don't know who brought me back after I decided to erase myself from the universe.

38
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,591
Erase the sunshine that thought he was the center of everything,

39
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,638
all he could see was himself and no one else.

40
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,685
And most importantly he didn't even see who he really was.

41
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,480
That morning on the morning of the 13th of February,

42
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,652
one day before valentine. I began to see the little things in the world.

43
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:26,451
I began to see other people, ordinary small people like me.

44
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,913
I look at their faces, their eyes, their smiles.

45
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,625
I can see their happiness and misery.

46
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,465
They don't look up at the angels and wish to be like them because they know they can't.

47
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,511
I see this city of angels is filled with a zest for life,

48
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,432
the meaning in life has now changed.

49
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,728
I understand Rain and Mek.

50
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,772
Yes,

51
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,108
my memory of Rain has returned.

52
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,237
I can remember everything.

53
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,533
I see Rain, I see Air,

54
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,870
I see other people there are in his life.

55
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,707
Everything is reset to the same as I vanished from the universe.

56
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,335
And whoever it is that brought me back,

57
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,797
I see things carry on like they should.

58
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,258
I see all those people returning to enjoy their lives as they should.

59
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,804
I can feel all their happiness.

60
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,600
I did it. I have resolved my problems,

61
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,353
The risk that I took last night paid off.

62
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,816
I brought them all back,

63
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,694
but not everyone…

64
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,824
Do you want to say hello?

65
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,662
No,

66
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,831
Not today.

67
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,565
I like the tale of the tragic river that you told.

68
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,486
I think it has more hope than the guy pushing that rock up the hill.

69
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,904
How so?

70
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,742
You said that if you crossed the river of death,

71
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,329
then no one can ever return to the world unless he's a hero.

72
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,582
Yes.

73
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,424
Who wished me back?

74
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,804
I can't tell you.

75
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,061
Then let's go back.

76
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,191
Wait, where are you going?

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,943
On the boat to that side.

78
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,447
Aren't you afraid? You don't know how to swim.

79
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,742
I'm not afraid of anything now, let's go.

80
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,952
Didn't you say you wanted a boat ride?

81
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:20,166
Yes but…

82
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,006
I will get you across.

83
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,390
Happy day before valentine's day!

84
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,850
Hi Jared. How you doing?

85
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,437
What's this rose's name?

86
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,942
Elizabeth. But call her Liz for short.

87
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,486
Okay, Liz,

88
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,239
you're pretty.

89
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,783
She's the star of the shop.

90
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,164
Jared, how long have you worked at the shop?

91
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,751
A long while. Since I dropped out of school,

92
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,546
I started working there. I didn't do anything else.

93
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,549
You must have found your path.

94
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,677
So what made you drop out?

95
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,931
I'm not so good at studying. When I was young,

96
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,059
I thought the words on the pages were dancing, it was funny at first

97
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:07,315
but when I got older the words got smaller and filled the pages and they jumped around

98
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,110
until my history teacher - Ms. Somsri, hit me in front of the class

99
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,862
because I misread history.

100
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,823
Oh, Ms. Somsri,

101
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,118
I remember. You mentioned her.

102
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,080
That's her, from then on I told my grandmother

103
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,999
I didn't want to go to school anymore,

104
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,753
that's when I found this shop.

105
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,006
Is he kind? Taetae.

106
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,051
He seems mean but he's kind to me.

107
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,553
Oh that's good.

108
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,266
And is it just you and your grandmother?

109
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,019
Yes. It's just us two.

110
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,856
Take good care of her, okay?

111
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,692
With my life.

112
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,657
Alright, thanks for chatting.

113
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,453
You're welcome. Normally nobody wants to talk with me,

114
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,581
because I'm…not like the others.

115
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,419
But I'm okay with it. I have the flowers, I can hear them talk.

116
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:16,008
Oh sorry, Taetae told me not to tell people that,

117
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,927
they'll think I'm crazy.

118
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,349
You're not crazy, if you were then I would be a loon.

119
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,645
But I don't really care what they say.

120
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,067
My Gran tells me to pay no mind because I am special to her.

121
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,277
Your Gran is sweet.

122
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,238
The sweetest in the world.

123
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,825
I've chatted too long, I must go.

124
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,098
Oh, the rose is here.

125
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,017
Jared named her Elizabeth.

126
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,103
Beautiful name.

127
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,022
He's an interesting guy, Jared.

128
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,357
How so?

129
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,196
I think he has something special, not like other people…

130
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,074
His attention to detail.

131
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,076
I'm glad.

132
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,453
Glad about what?

133
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,914
Glad that you…understand those around you

134
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,210
I was really bad before,

135
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,172
I cared for no one.

136
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,468
Come, give me the rose, I'll put it in a vase.

137
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,596
No, Let me give it a try.

138
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,626
Done.

139
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,588
What do you think?

140
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,673
Not bad.

141
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,021
Hey, I want to take you to this flower shop,

142
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,442
in the afternoon they sell flowers and in the evening it's a bar.

143
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,738
The owner is such a freaking weirdo, You'll like it.

144
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,242
It's not my thing, you don't have to take me.

145
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,326
What? why?

146
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,455
I…don't drink.

147
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,461
Okay, then tell me where you want to go,

148
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,089
I will take you everywhere.

149
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,634
Let me shower first.

150
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,450
What's with the staring?

151
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,494
I'm glad you're back.

152
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,623
You know who brought me back but you won't tell me.

153
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,210
You know it's the rules.

154
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,047
I know. I have to find out for myself.

155
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,385
Why do you want to know? Let me ask you

156
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:48,846
Ask what?

157
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,685
Last night after you made your wish, what do you remember?

158
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,735
It was like the nights before.

159
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,364
Usually it's like I black out,

160
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,701
like I'm really sleepy and pass out.

161
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,246
But last night, I was still aware…

162
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:19,376
and everything was white,

163
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,297
all white and flashes of images going by really fast.

164
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,090
What images?

165
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,051
Old images,

166
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,973
some I've already forgotten,

167
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,315
it was so fast, I wasn't ready,

168
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,238
they were people's lives,

169
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,827
and in the end I saw…

170
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,373
Who?

171
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,231
Then there was a bright light heading towards me,

172
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,985
or was it me heading towards it?

173
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,697
That second

174
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,618
I thought this must be what death feels like.

175
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,082
The light grew brightest

176
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,794
like it was trying to swallow me

177
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,592
and then I can't remember anything else.

178
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,179
You can't remember anything? After that?

179
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,895
It was like the end,

180
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,108
finished

181
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,487
nothing else,

182
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,452
and you?

183
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,162
What?

184
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,665
Could you remember when you…

185
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,502
Similar to yours.

186
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,214
Flashing images came really fast,

187
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,636
but then a black out, no bursting light,

188
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,431
who knows how long that darkness was

189
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,021
then after that I became what I am.

190
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,732
Because you didn't get to come back,

191
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,443
like I did.

192
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,956
And what if someone helped bring you back again?

193
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,920
You would forget all of this

194
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,966
and forget that you were a cupid reaper,

195
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,265
you'd forget about meeting me,

196
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,481
like how I don't remember anything after that bright light.

197
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,738
Maybe so.

198
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
But I...

199
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,869
I probably won't return.

200
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,416
Come to think of it, you're already here,

201
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,544
even if it's another version.

202
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,256
The version that doesn't exist.

203
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,597
But you do exist,

204
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,227
for me.

205
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
Thank you

206
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,462
Cupid reaper.

207
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,986
This version of you is much more gentle.

208
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,826
I'm curious about another thing.

209
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,414
Enough with this curiosity. I want to go out!

210
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,042
Okay, sure.

211
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,713
Where would Mr. Cupid reaper like to go?

212
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,513
Is it good?

213
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,473
Yes.

214
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,474
eat it all.

215
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,516
Hang on,

216
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,267
What flavor is that?

217
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,518
I don't know

218
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,150
eat it all.

219
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,820
This one is good.

220
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,073
It's almost gone.

221
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,598
Is it good?

222
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,808
Yes, but spicy.

223
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,519
D'you want another?

224
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,189
Let's save it for other stuff.

225
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,359
So greedy, what kind of angel are you anyway?

226
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,943
Well it's good,

227
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:47,657
no wonder why they say Bangkok street food is heaven for foodies.

228
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,453
Could be true.

229
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,082
You're not enjoying it?

230
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,128
Let me confess something,

231
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,383
before when Rain took me here

232
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,011
my eyes would be staring at those skyscrapers over there,

233
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,140
wondering what are they eating or what are they up to?

234
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,519
One day, I'm going to leave that apartment,

235
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,064
buy myself a hundred million baht condo way up high

236
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,024
and that day

237
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,445
I will look down and shout I won!!

238
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:35,414
And you will be so high up that you won't be able to see people eating really good beef Pad gaprao.

239
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,295
I'm such an idiot.

240
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:46,925
Hey kid.

241
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,844
Valentine rose, sir.

242
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:49,970
How much for one?

243
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,140
Fifty baht, my mum made it.

244
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,433
How's business?

245
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,185
I've got a few left, but I have to go home soon.

246
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,437
Come,

247
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,648
let me help you.

248
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,780
Keep the change and treat yourself.

249
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,199
You're so kind sir. Thank you.

250
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,367
Get home safe.

251
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,577
Okay.

252
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,714
Did you see the look in his eyes?

253
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,591
When he was happy

254
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,675
I did.

255
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,595
It was good,

256
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,889
Man I'm happy

257
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,853
We can easily make people happy but we don't do it.

258
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,245
It's for you.

259
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,419
For me?

260
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,547
why?

261
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,428
I want to to have it, like sincerely

262
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,669
How is it going today?

263
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,546
It was fun, I like it.

264
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,215
Good, I'm glad you like it.

265
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,651
Tomorrow is finally Valentine's.

266
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,447
Actually...

267
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,910
in a few hours.

268
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,958
Yes, in a few hours.

269
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,462
Do you remember,

270
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,090
you told me

271
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:38,054
you're from the past and that I am your future

272
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,599
and that our time doesn't coincide.

273
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,310
I remember.

274
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,895
I don't get it

275
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,065
and I don't care

276
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,111
if our time is out of sync.

277
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,324
I just know

278
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,287
I like who I am in the present.

279
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,523
In a couple of hours it's going to be Valentine's day.

280
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,818
You're here with me, Meen.

281
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,320
I hope we don't have any lonely hearts tonight.

282
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,407
Anyone here on their own?

283
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,910
There are some singles over there.

284
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,623
I suggest maybe make your way over and get to know each other,

285
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,461
don't be shy, this is your moment,

286
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,048
you never know when you will get the opportunity again,

287
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,554
perhaps it might be next valentine,

288
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,849
Even though it's every year,

289
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,853
but a chance like this may never come again.

290
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:54,399
Believe me, you might meet the one or you might not,

291
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,486
but just as long as you take a chance.

292
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,780
Yes,

293
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,866
just like that.

294
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:08,538
Letting faith guide your way, love could be around the corner.

295
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:28,767
As for me, I have love for all of you here tonight.

296
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:36,524
My love is the wish to sooth your souls with my songs.

297
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,652
As long as you are happy, I am happy,

298
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,239
just like everyday is valentine's day.

299
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:52,791
I have a song request, just right for this romantic evening,

300
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,751
if you please.

301
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:17,190
We traveled past each other from different planets.

302
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,528
On a cold night

303
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,156
We met again.

304
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:30,537
Will it be time, fate, or trepidation?

305
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:38,378
that brought you and me Let's be together here.

306
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:44,676
And when the sight Let's coordinate

307
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:51,808
our universe Move in and overlap.

308
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:58,690
If we embrace without knowing

309
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:05,655
What will it feel like?

310
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:11,202
Experienced through the breath

311
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:24,465
Let us float away in this moment

312
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:38,396
If there were only shadows in our arms

313
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:46,446
In this time How warm will it be?

314
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,576
And when you gently kiss When we're close

315
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:59,375
It probably makes my heart tremble. Will the loneliness go away?

316
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:06,257
And when the sight Let's coordinate

317
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:12,764
our universe Move in and overlap.

318
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:20,021
If we embrace without knowing

319
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,277
What will it feel like?

320
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:31,616
On the night of two stars...

321
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,451
Can I ask you something?

322
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,746
What do you want to ask?

323
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,085
After the seven days,

324
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,880
where will you go next?

325
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,176
I don't know.

326
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,680
Wherever they send me.

327
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,726
Like how they sent you to me?

328
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:06,609
I want to stop this moment.

329
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,407
I don't know the night or day.

330
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,419
Hello, sunshine. What wind blows you here?

331
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,671
The wind that is you.

332
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,923
Sweet talker.

333
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,594
I guess you've heard about Rain and I?

334
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,015
I'm sorry.

335
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,933
It's okay.

336
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,687
If he meets someone better, I'm glad for him,

337
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,189
but we can still be friends.

338
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,363
Oh, Meen, this is my friend. His name is Q.

339
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:53,865
Hello, Q.

340
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:54,949
Hello.

341
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,538
Don't give me that look, Meen.

342
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,165
We're really friends.

343
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,084
I can't find someone new that fast.

344
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,796
I believe you, I didn't even say anything.

345
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,382
Please make yourselves at home.

346
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,343
I'm going to say hi to the other customers,

347
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,804
stick around and we'll talk later.

348
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,314
Meen probably thinks you and I are…

349
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,608
Why are you smiling?

350
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,070
I…

351
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,697
don't know what to say.

352
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,707
Say something,

353
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,544
whatever is on your mind

354
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,090
I can't.

355
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,847
You can't because you don't know

356
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,143
or is there something here?

357
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,606
I can't say.

358
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,154
Can I get to know you more than this

359
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,617
Q?

360
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,997
Before…tomorrow

361
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,545
Who knows where they are going to send you.

362
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,353
Hey look, my phone is working again.

363
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,816
It came back to life like you.

364
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,655
Do you think these roses will want to be with the other roses?

365
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,659
I don't think so.

366
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,035
Why?

367
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,873
They came from different places.

368
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,836
Actually every rose comes from different places,

369
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,922
but don't you think they want to have friends?

370
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,676
Maybe

371
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,637
or maybe not,

372
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,182
we can't read their minds

373
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,565
What about you,

374
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,568
didnt you want to have any friends?

375
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,411
Yeah I do,

376
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,789
But it's hard

377
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,711
to meet others that are in the same universe as you.

378
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,505
Same universe?

379
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,467
Yeah…

380
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,265
people are in their own universes.

381
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,518
Bubbles of universes

382
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,898
floating around everywhere,

383
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,611
so many that it's uncountable.

384
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,909
Sometimes our universe comes together

385
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,584
and you think it could be one of the same,

386
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,299
but it's not.

387
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:55,231
Some universes have happiness, success,

388
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,485
so different from mine,

389
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:06,075
Some universes are full of pain and disappointment,

390
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,706
So that's why I say we all exist in our separate universes.

391
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,713
We see each other

392
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,633
but we do not co exist.

393
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,810
I'm not talking about the multiverse or some kind of physics theory,

394
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,271
it's just my own theory.

395
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,235
Theory of an artist.

396
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,697
I'm just a mediocre actor

397
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,658
who is not even brave enough to call himself an artist.

398
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,204
Then...

399
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,877
I will put them all here together,

400
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,257
they won't bicker like people, right?

401
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,140
Tomorrow…what are your plans?

402
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,603
I have decided to go see the snow on my own.

403
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,272
Good, You've already booked the tickets.

404
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,440
Yeah,

405
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:27,114
look - two seats. I'm gonna be comfortable.

406
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,118
I'll remember the flight, incase I join you.

407
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,838
It would be good if you could come with me.

408
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,761
But really...

409
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:54,100
I have to start a new mission with someone,

410
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,436
I don't even know.

411
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,090
Tonight…

412
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,261
Can you tell me more about who you are?

413
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,639
I've told you -

414
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,057
It's the rules.

415
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,274
How about this...

416
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,819
You tell me a story

417
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,740
like the way I told my story about that boy,

418
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,581
the boy that...

419
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,502
everybody deserted.

420
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,591
I…

421
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,052
Come on,

422
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,640
before tomorrow

423
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,311
and that boy will have to be...

424
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,523
by himself forever.

425
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,338
I hope that you

426
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,466
find someone

427
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,679
that will share the same universe as you,

428
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,102
so that you won't have to be alone ever again.

429
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,150
Did you just give me a blessing?

430
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,948
I...

431
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,659
want it to come true.

432
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,457
I want it to come true as well.

433
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,170
I want you to be happy.

434
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,676
And what about you…

435
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,907
I know that

436
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,119
you're suffering.

437
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,391
I want you to find happiness,

438
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,311
Q.

439
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,012
Are you ready to tell me your story?

440
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:00,929
I...

441
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,139
Come on,

442
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,891
It's just a fairy tale…right?

443
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,352
Once upon a time , there was a young man

444
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,687
Who fought for every chance in life.

445
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,274
But he didn't know that the time he had left with his father,

446
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,610
was running out.

447
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,448
I can still make one more wish right? The last one?

448
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,532
Yes.

449
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:26,205
After I've made my wish, you will no longer be here, right?
