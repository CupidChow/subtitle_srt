1
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,865
The morning of the 13th of February,

2
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,867
I woke up one more time,

3
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,370
Everything is reset to the same as I vanished from the universe.

4
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,332
And whoever it is that brought me back,

5
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,167
I have a new life.

6
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,212
Thank you Cupid Reaper.

7
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,757
After the seven days, where will you go next?

8
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,175
I don't know.

9
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,885
I want you to be happy.

10
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,595
And what about you…

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,139
I want you to find happiness,

12
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,892
Q.

13
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,882
Here you are.

14
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,682
Trying to talk to the one in charge up there?

15
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,900
It’s not that simple.

16
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,402
Isn't it like in the movies?

17
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,780
If I didn't experience it myself

18
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,866
I would think it’s only in the movies,

19
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,495
hey, when you were young what was your favourite movie?

20
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,081
I never watched movies.

21
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,794
You were probably a weird kid, so what did you do?

22
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,717
Look at the sky, at the stars.

23
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,928
Romantic kid.

24
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,514
Far from it. I had nothing to do.

25
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,102
So I watched the stars in the sky.

26
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,980
I became interested in the solar system,

27
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,067
I searched for the answers to everything,

28
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,446
I wanted to know how we exist on this earth in this universe.

29
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,824
Did you get your answers?

30
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,669
Okay, so...

31
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,589
are you ready to tell me a story?

32
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,801
I…

33
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,220
Come on.

34
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,058
It’s just a fairy tale, right? It’s made up.

35
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,151
Once upon a time

36
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,946
there was a boy

37
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,284
who grew up in a province far away.

38
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,579
His mother passed away when he was young.

39
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,374
His father was an agriculturist.

40
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,961
He lived with his father on a farmhouse in the mountains.

41
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,714
Land far as the eye can see.

42
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,093
But he never did any farm work,

43
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,429
he never harvested any crops,

44
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
his dad kept him away from hard work.

45
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,729
His only purpose was to wake up at dawn,

46
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:17,442
get on a bus to go to school two hours away from home,

47
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:24,365
the morning mist and the first light of day was what he remembered.

48
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,411
Sounds much better than the city life,

49
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,831
to be with nature.

50
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,460
People never value the things they have.

51
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,670
Same for that boy,

52
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,883
his dream was to get out of that place,

53
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,887
go somewhere that you didn't have to spend two hours on a bus to reach a school,

54
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:50,475
a hospital, or anything good that existed elsewhere

55
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,602
far from where he lived.

56
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,313
So he came to live in the city?

57
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,939
No,

58
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,983
his dream was bigger than that.

59
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:06,616
He was good at studies so he was at the top of his school in his province.

60
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,035
He wanted to be a scientist.

61
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,120
When he was in sixth grade,

62
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,500
all the teachers believed he would get into the best university in the country,

63
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,419
in the faculty with the highest points.

64
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,797
Social values.

65
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,006
Yes,

66
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,009
Social values tricked a lot of people into believing that.

67
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,013
But he went even further.

68
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,099
How so?

69
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,688
He wanted to win the scholarship to study abroad

70
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,943
He studied hard into the nights,

71
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,112
he never had the opportunity to get tutoring classes

72
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,199
like those with privileges,

73
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,494
so he had to work hard.

74
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,455
And in the end

75
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,042
he did it.

76
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,378
His father was very happy.

77
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,672
He told the whole village.

78
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,842
His dad took him into town to buy clothes,

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,595
to buy clothes, appliances, luggages, all the best.

80
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,681
His father was very happy.

81
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,393
Four years after he left his village

82
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,479
to live in a cold country with snow.

83
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,483
He heard his father’s voice through the phone line asking him

84
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,194
how he was,

85
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,239
to rest well,

86
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,700
not to strain himself too much,

87
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,743
to look after his health

88
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,080
and with the last line

89
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,041
I’m here waiting for you.

90
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,296
But he...

91
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,965
would cut short the conversation every time

92
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,884
“i have a test, dad”

93
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,137
“I’m still doing  my project, dad”

94
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,891
“i have to go study, dad”

95
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,811
“I’ll be assisting the professor at the end of the semester”

96
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,190
This went on until he graduated.

97
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,526
He seems very determined,

98
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,447
he probably has very high ambitions.

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,740
Very high,

100
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,410
so high that he himself doesn't realise.

101
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:19,665
All he thought was it still wasn't high enough.

102
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,709
Icarus.

103
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
What?

104
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,213
Who?

105
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,547
Icarus,

106
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,092
he flew too close to the sun,

107
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,720
so his wings melted.

108
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,683
Now I’m close to the Sunshine, will my wings melt?

109
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,852
No, not yet…

110
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,854
go on.

111
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,315
He graduated.

112
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,362
He was offered a scholarship to further his education.

113
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,907
He got the opportunity to be the assistant to his professor.

114
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,454
But he had to choose whether to return home or grab what was offered.

115
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,207
He took the opportunity.

116
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,917
Of course.

117
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,712
It will lead to other opportunities,

118
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,506
that’s all he thought.

119
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,052
He told his father he wasn't coming back.

120
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,306
He has to go further, he has to go higher.

121
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,602
What did his dad say?

122
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,566
His dad said…

123
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,818
Go for it son,

124
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,613
go as high as you can, to the top.

125
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,116
As far as you can go,

126
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,619
don’t worry about me.

127
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,373
he fought for every chance in life.

128
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,043
But he didn't know

129
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,921
that the time he had left with his father,

130
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,508
was running out.

131
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,138
Then what happened?

132
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,018
One day,

133
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,397
he got a call.

134
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,026
It was his dad’s number,

135
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,112
but it wasn't his dad…

136
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,491
A distant relative called to tell him...

137
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,036
his dad was badly ill.

138
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,497
He was in the hospital

139
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,084
but he didn't want anyone to know,

140
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,503
afraid that they would worry,

141
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,049
but the relative decided to call

142
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,679
because his dad doesn't have much time.

143
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,141
So,

144
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,810
then he decided to go home

145
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,481
after being away for seven years.

146
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,319
If his dad hadn't fallen ill, he would never come.

147
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,078
He rushed to the hospital,

148
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,706
when he opened the door,

149
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,336
his father turned to smile with delight

150
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,547
and also confusion at the same time

151
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,259
But...

152
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,847
his father looked so frail…

153
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,004
A warm glass of milk.

154
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,965
Thanks.

155
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,975
Strange of you today drinking milk

156
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,019
instead of alcohol.

157
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,026
So that I don’t blame all of what's happening on alcohol

158
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,654
and also…

159
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,739
Also what?

160
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,294
I want to take care of you.

161
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,612
Do you remember?

162
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,031
The first night we met.

163
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,950
You were so drunk.

164
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,452
Yes.

165
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,498
Flowers get you high but alcohol makes you see the truth.

166
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,001
Surely a broken heart philosophy.

167
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,011
You’re no longer broken-hearted?

168
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,308
I’m glad

169
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,564
As if I’ve risen from the intoxication

170
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,485
and the illusion still lingers.

171
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,404
What play is that from?

172
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,825
I’ve just made it up.

173
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,161
Okay,

174
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,372
continue with your story.

175
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,302
The boy hugged his dad and cried.

176
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,098
He told his dad that he has to pull through,

177
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,226
his dad still had the strength to fuss about

178
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,105
who told the boy making him drop his work

179
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,483
and having to come down here.

180
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,737
And that day...

181
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,700
he heard from the doctor himself…

182
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,494
His condition has worsened,

183
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,205
it has reached the stage that is untreatable,

184
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,708
his father...

185
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,711
doesn't have much time left

186
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,633
He begged the Doctor to save his dad,

187
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,927
to find a way,

188
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,308
whatever it takes, no matter how much it costs, or what he had to sacrifice,

189
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,518
he would give it all,

190
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,979
but the truth was,

191
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,149
there was no way.

192
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,654
He then realized.

193
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,284
He chose to fight for opportunities for a better life,

194
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,622
so he didn't notice that there was someone waiting for him,

195
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,712
and his time was running short

196
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,260
And now he was losing the opportunity that was priceless,

197
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,648
the opportunity to spend time with the one he loved most,

198
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,987
he was going to lose that.

199
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,707
He thought it over.

200
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,918
He wasn't going to give up.

201
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,795
He still had hope.

202
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,383
This doctor may not be able to help but there are other doctors.

203
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,972
In the middle of the night,

204
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,767
while he was deep in thought,

205
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,732
he saw someone coming out of his father’s room.

206
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,152
It must be another Doctor.

207
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,784
He wanted to talk to him.

208
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,744
To ask about his father.

209
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,084
He ran

210
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,182
after him,

211
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,605
but I just couldn't catch up.

212
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,585
And in the end,

213
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,920
he stood there and waited.

214
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,507
Doctor.

215
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,051
Doctor.

216
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
He wasn't a doctor.

217
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,287
Who was he?

218
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,958
He said he was a reaper,

219
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,836
a reaper that could grant wishes.

220
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,214
He was a reaper like you?

221
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:11,924
Yes,

222
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,968
but different policies.

223
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,011
How so?

224
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:22,726
He promised that the father of that boy will continue to live

225
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,480
if the boy will choose which candle to blow out.

226
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,651
Simple enough. Just blow it out.

227
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,529
It’s not just an ordinary candle,

228
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,073
it’s the candle of life.

229
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,200
Candle of life?

230
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,284
Yes.

231
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,204
The life of two other people,

232
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,623
who must choose to extinguish one of them.

233
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,252
So that his dad can live another day.

234
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,629
Just one day?

235
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,923
Just one day.

236
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,886
Do you know how much that means,

237
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,139
not even a day,

238
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,684
even an hour, a minute, he would give anything,

239
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,981
you should understand that.

240
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,367
And...

241
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,122
the two candles, who were they?

242
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,752
One of them he knows

243
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,547
but the other candle

244
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,008
was someone he didn't know of,

245
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,053
if it was you what would you do?

246
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:42,931
The one I don't know.

247
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,558
That’s what anyone would do.

248
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,352
But then again,

249
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,189
when he knew the name of that person,

250
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,107
he changed his mind.

251
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:53,942
Doctor.

252
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,152
Doctor.

253
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,696
Why? Who was he?

254
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,328
The doctor that was treating his dad,

255
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,581
the one that said his dad could be saved.

256
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,751
The doctor that took care of his dad,

257
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,462
when they first found out,

258
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,174
the doctor said his dad was fine

259
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,593
and it was nothing

260
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,554
But now…

261
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,348
So he…

262
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,557
Yes.

263
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,810
Without hesitation, he blew out that man's candle.

264
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,484
Then what happened?

265
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,196
The day after,

266
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,449
his dad got better like it was a miracle,

267
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,578
but for the doctor,

268
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,914
he had an accident

269
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,668
and died instantly.

270
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,300
That’s brutal.

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,053
And that night,

272
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,722
his father’s condition worsened.

273
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,810
Life was just draining from him.

274
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,146
So he appeared again

275
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,191
with two more candles.

276
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,527
One was someone you know

277
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,780
and the other, a stranger.

278
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,074
Same game.

279
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,743
Yes,

280
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,913
Same game. Same rules,

281
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,542
and so he thought he would blow out the candle of the stranger

282
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,044
but he changed his mind,

283
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,547
night after night,

284
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,924
names of people he knew,

285
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,719
people he wanted to disappear from this world,

286
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,931
This is not just brutal,

287
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,642
but it’s inhuman.

288
00:21:55,439 --> 00:22:01,111
If you’ve killed once then it gets easier the next time

289
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,280
right?

290
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,408
And...

291
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,829
how was his dad?

292
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,711
The same,

293
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,756
better in the morning,

294
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,260
with the news of the death of teh person that he blew out,

295
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,681
after that he would get weaker

296
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,644
till midnight

297
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,857
till another life is sacrificed

298
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,153
for his life to live another day.

299
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,407
The agony…

300
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,494
Yes,

301
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,996
the agony.

302
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,418
It hurts to see his dad suffer,

303
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,256
then seven days passed.

304
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,969
On the next day which would eb halloween,

305
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,226
his dad told him he was happy

306
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,438
to see the boy succeed,

307
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,942
he was happy

308
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,405
to see the boy back home,

309
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,160
there’s no need to extend his time.

310
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,790
Death is not so bad,

311
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,837
death is mercy,

312
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,928
he has lived a good life,

313
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,265
he’s had enough…

314
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,272
Are you okay?

315
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,859
You don’t have to go on,

316
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,778
you can stop here.

317
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,953
I’m okay.

318
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,170
I want to.

319
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,132
I want to tell the story,

320
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,261
it’s getting to the important part.

321
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,768
The night was windy, while he was deep in thought, deciding.

322
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:45,358
The reaper appeared with the candles of life as usual.

323
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,238
One held the life of someone he didn't know.

324
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,950
And the other candle...

325
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,996
was his father.

326
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,796
When the moment came.

327
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,591
It was hard to decide.

328
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,720
He didn't want his father to suffer any more.

329
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,183
But he also didn't want to be the one to blow out that candle.

330
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:26,024
But then suddenly the wind blew out the other candle right in front of his eyes.

331
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:30,904
The boy decided to use his father’s candle

332
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,450
to light up the extinguished candle.

333
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,540
Before... blowing out his father’s candle.

334
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,342
Then his father finally passed.

335
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,304
No more suffering.

336
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,978
He smiled with peace.

337
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,944
And that other life

338
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,030
can return

339
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,245
and have his chance in this world.

340
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,373
Do you...

341
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,501
still remember the name?

342
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,179
I can’t remember.

343
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,064
So the moral of the tale is...

344
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,944
we cannot...

345
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,740
stop death.

346
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,079
No, it doesn't end there.

347
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,254
Did something happen to the boy?

348
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,924
After the death of his father,

349
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,470
he was busy with the funeral arrangements.

350
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,014
After everything had passed

351
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,643
he had time to himself.

352
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,270
He was sad.

353
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,525
He blamed himself for neglecting his father

354
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,571
and still wished for another chance

355
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,035
without thinking it was all his fault.

356
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,081
He didn't go back abroad?

357
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,209
No,

358
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,295
he didn't have the strength,

359
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,131
he had no more motivation to live.

360
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,218
Then that night…

361
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,095
There was a full moon.

362
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:05,141
He walked down into the canal that ran through the village,

363
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,396
he went deeper and deeper.

364
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,066
Then images from the past come back

365
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,652
like a movie.

366
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,196
It was so fast.

367
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,699
so fast.

368
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,034
And in the end

369
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,662
everything went dark,

370
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,748
very dark,

371
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,875
for a long tine.

372
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,094
And then…

373
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,179
That’s it.

374
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,933
That’s really it?

375
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,519
That’s how it ends. That’s all I can tell.

376
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,578
Thank you.

377
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,623
Thanks so much.

378
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,049
That's enough for me.

379
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,928
Thank you for telling me this story.

380
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,277
I will never forget you.

381
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,449
I will never forget you too.

382
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,861
Can you tell me something?

383
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,115
If I was to document all that happened,

384
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,954
including the story that you told me

385
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,999
You are welcome to.

386
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,971
When Rain disappeared

387
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,683
I tried writing about it

388
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,105
but I couldn't remember anything about him,

389
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,983
ao all I had was the title.

390
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,777
What did you name it?

391
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,365
Seven days before valentine

392
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,744
Interesting,

393
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,543
seven days before valentine.

394
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,962
Just seven days

395
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,634
but so much has happened in my life.

396
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,054
A very valuable lesson.

397
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,931
I’m glad.

398
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,601
You have helped a self centered,

399
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,604
selfish,

400
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,942
self entitled person to change so much,

401
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,488
you really should get a reward from heaven.

402
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,159
You changing into a better person

403
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,704
is a reward for me already.

404
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,290
Without you around,

405
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,501
It’s going to be lonely.

406
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,172
Your life has to go on,

407
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,592
you will meet more people.

408
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,888
But will they be good to me as you are,

409
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,016
Q?

410
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:34,494
Oh human, are you fond of a devil like me?

411
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,371
You’re hiding something.

412
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,206
What am I hiding?

413
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,084
You always did it,

414
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,254
you fought with yourself every time I asked you to erase someone,

415
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,882
you wanted me to know better,

416
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,177
but I was naive.

417
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,304
I know

418
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,391
that you suffered…

419
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,143
But now you know better,

420
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,604
I’m happy.

421
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:04,816
Really?

422
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,192
Yes.

423
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,864
And what about the tragic river?

424
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,618
The one you said no one could return,

425
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,332
don't you want to return?

426
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,545
That's impossible.

427
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,465
It says so in the tale, that only a hero

428
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,467
can come back.

429
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,511
That’s me,

430
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,974
an ordinary guy, kind of a loser too.

431
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,268
I returned.

432
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,980
In fact,

433
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,651
I have to thank “that guy”

434
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,696
that helped me come back.

435
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,866
I owe it to him

436
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,162
He doesn't want you to do that again.

437
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,165
I'm not going to do it again.

438
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,918
And I also don't want him to do the same either.

439
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,546
Q.

440
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,548
Yes.

441
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,761
You once said you came from the past.

442
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,973
As for me, I am your future.

443
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,768
Yeah, why?

444
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,605
Where is the past and future?

445
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,650
The future is ahead of us,

446
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,653
the past is behind us.

447
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,406
So now we are in the present right?

448
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,575
Hard to say.

449
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,578
Sometimes they overlap,

450
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,415
the past and the future,

451
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,335
time is just a made up theory,

452
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,046
perhaps we only have the present.

453
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,966
It’s a shame I study performance arts,

454
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,552
I will never get any of this stuff.

455
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,387
Come on,

456
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,349
even scientist still can’t find the answers to everything.

457
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,309
So what do they do?

458
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,228
Keep searching.

459
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,688
Or just accept it

460
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,816
and move on.

461
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,111
Accept the uncertain?

462
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,239
The rule of uncertainty.

463
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,884
It’s almost midnight,

464
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,138
I can make another wish right?

465
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,808
The last wish.

466
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,812
Yes.

467
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,944
But I no longer want rain to come back.

468
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,073
He already met someone much more suitable for him.

469
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,246
But you can still wish for someone to disappear.

470
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,460
That’s not against the rules?

471
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,754
No.

472
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,137
I have a bit of time left.

473
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,849
I hope you have a good time tomorrow

474
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,226
I still haven't packed my bags.

475
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,519
You have time.

476
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,230
It’s not a morning flight.

477
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,858
You remembered.

478
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,777
It would be good

479
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,113
if you could come,

480
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,285
But you must be bored of snow.

481
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,330
Not really,

482
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,875
enjoy it for me.

483
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,146
Q…

484
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,611
after I make my wish,

485
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,365
I will fall asleep

486
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,284
and when I wake up

487
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,206
you will not be here right?

488
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,710
Probably,

489
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,340
I don't like goodbyes.

490
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,552
All things are uncertain.

491
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,723
But saying goodbyes is a sure thing.

492
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,728
And it’s a lot to deal with.

493
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,899
I will probably miss you.

494
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,444
That’s so good

495
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,947
to hear this.

496
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,369
And you….

497
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,080
Are you going to miss me?

498
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,541
Definitely.

499
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,085
I will surely miss you.

500
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,714
Promise?

501
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,591
Promise.

502
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,524
It’s time.

503
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,292
For my last wish…

504
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,088
I am at your command.

505
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,220
Q,

506
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,434
I wish for you to be happy,

507
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,230
and no longer suffer.

508
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,990
I wish...

509
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,369
for you...

510
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,831
to disappear from this universe.

511
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,333
Sun.

512
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,853
We traveled past each other from different planets.

513
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:02,191
On a cold night

514
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,820
We met again.

515
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:11,200
Will it be time, fate, or trepidation?

516
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:19,041
that brought you and me Let's be together here.

517
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:19,143
If there were only shadows in our arms

518
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:27,193
In this time How warm will it be?

519
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:32,323
And when you gently kiss When we're close

520
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:40,122
It probably makes my heart tremble. Will the loneliness go away?

521
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,681
Love is a combination of many things.

522
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,643
It’s not just owning someone.

523
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,398
Q, thanks for everything.

524
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,777
Thank you for this brief experience.

525
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,112
In just seven days.

526
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,741
But the wounds are still fresh in my heart.

527
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,537
Feelings that won't go away,

528
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,915
so I need to tie up some loose ends
