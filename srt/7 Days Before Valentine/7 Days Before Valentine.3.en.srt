1
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,074
Rain, who's this?

2
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,993
It's Earth, my new boyfriend whom I told you about last night...

3
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,412
You said you're the "Cupid Reaper"

4
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,373
who had the power to bring Rain back to me.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:27,670
I never said I have the "power" to bring anyone back to you.

6
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,049
What I can do is to "erase" anyone as you command.

7
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,594
whoever you think if you eliminate them, will make Rain come back to you.

8
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:40,558
You still have a chance to erase 6 more people, 6 times, 6 nights.

9
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,276
I don't know who this Earth guy is.

10
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,113
And when did he get to Rain before me?

11
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,326
Well, You just didn't see

12
00:01:58,993 --> 00:01:59,869
it coming.

13
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,040
who would make something like this obvious?

14
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,043
Things like this

15
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,964
if you use only your eyes and not your heart

16
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,800
you'll never see it.

17
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,386
Think about it.

18
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,472
When Air is gone, this guy Earth appears instead.

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,974
Who's Air?

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,809
That Air...

21
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,438
Oh...  um...

22
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:28,940
Oh!

23
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,069
last night...  , I was here, right?

24
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,082
Why do you ask?

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,170
I...  I just need to be sure.

26
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,880
Sure about what?

27
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,800
Sure that you really exist?

28
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:01,431
No, nobody really exists.

29
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,320
Then...  where was I last night?

30
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,656
Or was I in some other dimension?

31
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,452
How should I know?

32
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,332
Because time doesn't really exist either.

33
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,011
My head hurts.

34
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,972
Then...

35
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,016
can I ask you something?

36
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,144
But you need to think before you answer.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,188
I always think first.

38
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,024
I wish my brain would wither so that I can stop thinking.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,404
If you had the power to erase anyone from this world

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,573
who would you erase?

41
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,293
I'm not answering that.

42
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,128
I'll end up in jail.

43
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,883
What about you?

44
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:19,801
Jared

45
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,887
who would you erase?

46
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,098
My teacher Somsri!

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,140
Why?

48
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,268
She caned me in history class!

49
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,102
Because I...

50
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,437
Don't listen to Jared's teenage trauma.

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,648
Even if you erase Somsri

52
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,191
there will be another teacher Somporn

53
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,736
Somsong, Somset, or many others, right?

54
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,155
and if you think about it

55
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,574
what good is having that power?

56
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,578
What do you hope to get by erasing someone?

57
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:49,998
For instance

58
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,041
by erasing someone

59
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,586
you might get back the love of another.

60
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,132
Nonsense!

61
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,925
I told you

62
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,178
people change all the time.

63
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,930
Use your brain and think

64
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,598
when did things change

65
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,017
and why?

66
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,394
find the real cause of the change.

67
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,939
Wait a minute!

68
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,441
This is Science

69
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:17,984
Buddhism

70
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,485
Metaphysics!

71
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,660
When did things change...

72
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,287
Why...

73
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,417
I got it!!

74
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,127
Thank you so much.

75
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,129
You're freaking awesome and so deep!

76
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,725
I gotta go.

77
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,186
Don't forget my flowers tomorrow.

78
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,239
Alas. Humans.

79
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,867
They can see everything

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,952
except themselves.

81
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,298
it's time for the flowers to go to bed.

82
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,773
Q...

83
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,448
If you're not drunk enough

84
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,200
Would you like to join me

85
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,326
Mr. Sunshine?

86
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,745
You really enjoy sitting in the bath

87
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,164
Never had a bathtub?

88
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,001
I forgot.

89
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,629
In hell they only have the boiling cauldron.

90
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,840
I do it because I wish to wash down my sins.

91
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,010
What sins do you have?

92
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,597
I can't tell you. It's a rule of heaven.

93
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,560
So then are you from hell or heaven?

94
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,731
I've told you, I'm the Cupid Reaper.

95
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,235
I come from between heaven and hell

96
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,278
between the past and the future

97
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,747
I know who I will ask you to erase tonight.

98
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,123
Earth?

99
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,208
Wrong!

100
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,210
That's surprising.

101
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,798
You told me to think carefully, didn't you?

102
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,716
Interesting.

103
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,512
Now I want to know your reason for erasing this person.

104
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,973
Do you need to hear the reason?

105
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,224
Of course I do.

106
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,066
I want to be sure that you're becoming more reasonable.

107
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,904
So that I know you're using your head

108
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,992
and not overwhelmed by your emotions.

109
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,043
Is this some kind of test?

110
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,968
You're smart

111
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,139
but sometimes smart people fail because they don't have wit.

112
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,023
Go put on some clothes.

113
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,756
Where are you going, dressed like that?

114
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,550
Or is that your work uniform?

115
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,182
Do you enjoy this kind of show

116
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,102
Faust.

117
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,814
The story of a man who seeks endless knowledge

118
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,363
eventually selling his soul to Mephistopheles

119
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,949
in exchange for the knowledge of the life he desires.

120
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,912
I'm doing some acting research.

121
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,375
Because you have to play Mephistopheles.

122
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,502
You're a good actor.

123
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,630
But here

124
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,090
no -

125
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,175
the commercial world

126
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,970
maybe they don't want a good actor like me.

127
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,973
I've done so much homework

128
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,685
but they just tell me to look sideways and upwards

129
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,940
while that ‘oppa' who can't even act gets all the fame.

130
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,113
Hmm, what's his name? That actor

131
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,199
Jeff.

132
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,284
Jeffrey Wong.

133
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,578
As for me

134
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,831
Sunshine no hope

135
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,709
a no-name actor that no one's ever heard of.

136
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,296
You're not going to ask me to erase Jeffrey Wong tonight, are you?

137
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,007
Why would I erase him?

138
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,177
Without Jeffrey Wong, it wouldn't make much difference to Rain.

139
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,680
He doesn't care about celebrities.

140
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,812
Then who do you want me to erase tonight?

141
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,149
Mek.

142
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,191
Mek?

143
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,068
Who is Mek?

144
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,364
Rain's ex-boyfriend, before he met me.

145
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,449
And the reason?

146
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,993
Do you have to analyze the reasons before you approve it?

147
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,579
I don't have the power to approve.

148
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,831
Whenever you confirm your wish

149
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,459
my job is to make that person disappear

150
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,294
whoever it may be.

151
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,463
Then why do you ask for the reason?

152
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,176
So you don't lament over the sins that you've committed.

153
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,728
Actually

154
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,022
it wouldn't be fair just to blame it on you

155
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,566
as I am equally involved.

156
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,111
We are truly partners in crime.

157
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,495
Can you tell me

158
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,747
why you have to...

159
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,123
Do this duty, you mean?

160
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,546
Because I can't escape what I've done.

161
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,549
What you've done...

162
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,801
I can't say anymore.

163
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,511
I told you

164
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,845
it's the rules.

165
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,809
Why don't you tell me your story.

166
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,521
My story?

167
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,774
Well...  your family

168
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,692
mother...

169
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:39,777
father...

170
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,820
I have nothing to tell.

171
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,329
You have your rules

172
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,915
I have mine.

173
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,001
The rules of this world

174
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,007
I understand.

175
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,403
If tonight...

176
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,738
I wish for someone to disappear.

177
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,742
Will what I wish last night be the same as before?

178
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,080
Same and not the same.

179
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,916
What do you mean?

180
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,586
When you make a new wish

181
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,213
the previous one will be erased

182
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,133
and every wish will start from the same point in time

183
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,844
when you just broke up with Rain.

184
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,764
Like a reset, right?

185
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,433
Something like that.

186
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,311
Then what will not be the same as before?

187
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:00,357
Because your new wish will immediately change everything again.

188
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,777
That's confusing.

189
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,073
But this rule is based on what principle?

190
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,116
Like...   I mean...

191
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,869
You want me to answer whether it's the principle of time

192
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,497
relativity, or something quantum?

193
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't think you want to give yourself a headache.

194
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,713
Or is it black magic?

195
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,090
Anything that humans can't explain

196
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,675
they call it black magic

197
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,679
But if they know the answer then it becomes science.

198
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,891
If all this is science

199
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,314
how would you explain your existence?

200
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,067
Pay me no mind.

201
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's just say everything is based on the rule of uncertainty.

202
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,158
The rule of uncertainty.

203
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,701
Yes

204
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,412
so back to your story.

205
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,748
My story?

206
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:00,918
Okay

207
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,088
I've thought it through that Mek is the reason Rain broke up with me.

208
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,048
If there was no Mek

209
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,300
I would still be with Rain

210
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,303
and Air wouldn't have anything to do with our lives.

211
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,598
The end.

212
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,184
Is that the rule of probability?

213
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,185
Why?

214
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
If you know something then just tell me.

215
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,813
I don't.

216
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,817
How about you tell me more about this Mek?

217
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,908
Rain broke up with Mek before he met me.

218
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,245
In fact, Rain is 5 years older than me

219
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,539
but I didn't feel we were that far apart.

220
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,209
We dated for almost two months before he brought me to his house

221
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,045
that night...

222
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,195
Was that your first kiss?

223
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,196
No!

224
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,281
Then why are you shy?

225
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,240
Not shy.

226
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,825
I have kissed people before...

227
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
it's just...

228
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,956
That was the first time I kissed a...

229
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,832
A guy.

230
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,126
Yeah, so what?

231
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,379
That's why - you won't give up because it's your first time

232
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
Do you want to hear the story?

233
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,258
Yes, sure. Sorry.

234
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,679
I was enjoying the moment

235
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,224
until I saw all the pictures of him.

236
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,565
Is that your ex?

237
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,343
I thought that was the end of it.

238
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,849
But the next morning

239
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,022
Mek just vanished.

240
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,108
First night

241
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,192
first kiss

242
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,402
first time

243
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,445
sounds very impressionable.

244
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,739
I thought, with me around

245
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,242
Rain would slowly forget about his ex.

246
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,706
Sometimes...  you can't just forget that easily.

247
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,834
I was very open with him.

248
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,711
I may be his current boyfriend

249
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,880
and it's fine to think about the past.

250
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,715
But then one day...

251
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,802
I went to his house

252
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,882
and saw the storage room door half-open.

253
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,593
I thought he was in there.

254
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,313
I went in.

255
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,080
That's when I realized he still couldn't let go of Mek

256
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,792
and I was the one who was trying to replace him.

257
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,545
No matter how hard I tried, I just didn't fit.

258
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,007
Did Rain ever tell you about his ex?

259
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,427
No

260
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,225
he didn't want to talk about it.

261
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,145
But it doesn't mean he stopped thinking about him.

262
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,112
Sometimes I look into his eyes

263
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,783
and I don't see myself in there anymore.

264
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,371
But it was Mek.

265
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,599
If Rain never got over Mek

266
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,810
did you know why they broke up?

267
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,854
He never told me

268
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,235
but that storage room spoke for itself

269
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
They knew each other since university.

270
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,579
Mek was an activist

271
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,332
an athlete, a scholarship student

272
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,918
nothing like me.

273
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,797
what we had in common was we were poor

274
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,548
struggling by ourselves.

275
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,759
You wanna get something to eat?

276
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,594
Nah, gonna head back to my dorm.

277
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,557
My treat.

278
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:58,937
Why your treat?

279
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,480
Because...  we're friends.

280
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,358
Hey, wait.

281
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,944
We're on the same team, don't you want to be friends?

282
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,946
I have an exam next week. I have to study.

283
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,698
It's next week.

284
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,450
There's still time. Relax a bit.

285
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,952
Why are you so serious about everything?

286
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,078
Listen

287
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,414
some people don't have time to relax.

288
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,458
If they don't take things seriously

289
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,460
they might miss their chances.

290
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,047
You don't get it.

291
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,383
We're not all born equal, you know.

292
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,553
What the hell?

293
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,388
For me

294
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,808
free food from others isn't as satisfying as the food I buy myself.

295
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,602
Go treat someone else.

296
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,437
I'm not hungry.

297
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,273
Hey, wait!

298
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,777
So, I won't treat you. We'll split the bill, okay?

299
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,362
I'm hungry.

300
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,420
Wow

301
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,547
that looks so good.

302
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,091
Do you always eat at fancy places or what?

303
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,469
Don't exaggerate.

304
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,471
I don't eat fancy meals everyday.

305
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,473
I'm just an average middle-class guy.

306
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,895
So, what class do you call someone who never eats anything fancy?

307
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,773
You want to bring this up again.

308
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,234
I just want you to think about it.

309
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,237
For me and many others in this country

310
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,240
this is an ordinary place where we eat every day.

311
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,283
It doesn't get any fancier than this.

312
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,744
Stir-fried basil with minced beef and fried egg is special enough

313
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,371
beef is more expensive than other meat.

314
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,916
Just regular beef, not wagyu, sirloin, or ribeye.

315
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,502
The truth is

316
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,172
there are classes above the ordinary and below the ordinary.

317
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,508
When you never eat at places like this

318
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,636
you are upper middle-class, above the ordinary.

319
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,764
Okay, hold up.

320
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,226
I know you're a sociology scholarship student

321
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,061
and not some regular Joe.

322
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,398
But right now I'm hungry, let's just eat, okay?

323
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,780
Wow

324
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,282
it's so spicy

325
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,908
but so yummy!

326
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,746
I warned you to tell them not to make it spicy.

327
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,999
Well I wanted to try.

328
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,375
Isn't it spicy for you?

329
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,130
No problem. My tongue is used to it.

330
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:34,968
For me

331
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,262
this stir-fried basil with minced beef and fried egg

332
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,014
is very special.

333
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,266
It reminds me of something.

334
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,268
What's that?

335
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,980
That food and people are alike.

336
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,734
To consider that a dish or a person is special or ordinary

337
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,655
does not depend on class nor price

338
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,365
but on...

339
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,117
On what?

340
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,413
It depends on what tastes good to you.

341
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,300
They knew each other since university.

342
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,761
Mek was an activist

343
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,513
an athlete, a scholarship student

344
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,099
nothing like me.

345
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,353
what we had in common was we were poor

346
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,813
struggling by ourselves.

347
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,990
It's 11 p.m. already

348
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,078
can I make my wish?

349
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,955
You haven't finished your story.

350
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,668
The rule is, you can only wish when it's exactly midnight

351
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,710
remember?

352
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,837
Hey

353
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,298
I'm kinda hungry.

354
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,384
Would you want to go get something to eat?

355
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,595
You're hungry at this hour?

356
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,726
Do you get hungry?

357
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,479
Of course

358
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,273
I get hungry just like you.

359
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,443
What do you want to eat?

360
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,697
Stir-fried basil with minced beef and fried egg

361
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,330
What?

362
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,499
The story you told made me crave it.

363
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,960
I'll take you to eat some other time.

364
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,336
Now that's a promise.

365
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,298
There are so many things I want to eat

366
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,718
and so many places I want to go.

367
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,803
So are you not from Bangkok?

368
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,514
I mean...  when you were a human.

369
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,266
No.

370
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,144
From your accent

371
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,690
I guess you're from somewhere...

372
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,735
I don't know. I can't tell.

373
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,111
Take a guess.

374
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,198
It seems like...

375
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,577
you never stay anywhere for long.

376
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,538
Are you a linguist?

377
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,874
I majored in acting.

378
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,461
I have a keen ear that catches accents, am I right?.

379
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,004
You're right.

380
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,048
I was born in some very distant province.

381
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,594
Then when I was about 17 or 18, I moved somewhere else.

382
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,597
Do you want me to guess more?

383
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,723
Try.

384
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,520
You finished high school and continued studying?

385
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,324
Did I get it right?

386
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,661
You're good at knowing other people's business.

387
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,623
Hey, trying to say I'm nosy?

388
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,916
I didn't say that.

389
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,960
I'm just surprised that how come someone smart like you...

390
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,004
Alright, that's enough. No more talk

391
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,299
People always overlook their own problems

392
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,176
until it's too late to fix them. Which is normal.

393
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,719
Not too late!

394
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,597
I see the problem now.

395
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,891
Do you want to hear more?

396
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,644
Oh, yes. Let's hear it.

397
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,191
As I said...

398
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,069
I'm nothing like Mek

399
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,363
except that we are both broke.

400
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,241
That must be what Rain saw in me.

401
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,326
He likes someone who fights for himself.

402
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,410
Like I do.

403
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,290
But Mek and I, we fight in different ways.

404
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:39,712
The world outside our university is struggling with equal marriage rights, yet within our university walls

405
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,549
there are issues even more unequal than that.

406
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,301
It's as if for some group of people

407
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,013
their time has stopped in the foregone era.

408
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,976
According to the university's announcement in 2021

409
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,105
dress codes for students are up to their gender identity

410
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,359
or gender expression.

411
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:06,239
This is meant to promote gender equality and against discrimination.

412
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,576
However, this year, in 2023

413
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,789
some professors still submitted complaints to the university administration

414
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,500
and tried to stop our friends who don't conform to their birth gender

415
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,503
from participating in various important university ceremonies.

416
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,674
I consider this an act of destroying the announcement of the university council

417
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,176
which is like our constitution.

418
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,971
It is an assault on our rights, equality, and, most importantly

419
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,849
an attack on democracy.

420
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,269
Are we going to let a group of conservative professors misuse their power

421
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:41,900
to destroy the progress we fought for so easily?

422
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,209
Mek's influence resonated with Rain.

423
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,046
They shared similar thoughts.

424
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,048
From being friends

425
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,550
they became lovers.

426
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,765
Every evening, they'd head out to eat stir-fried basil with minced beef and fried egg together.

427
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,851
Then they graduate and go separate ways.

428
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,229
Rain worked in the corporate world briefly before leaving to open a coffee shop.

429
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,190
As for Mek

430
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,109
he became a full-time activist

431
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,905
although he might not be adored much by some 'big' people.

432
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,079
You really went into detail as if you were there yourself.

433
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,083
Gotta thank Rain for his detailed notes

434
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,127
and my job that requires imagination.

435
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,757
So, are you saying that what you told me is partly from your own imagination?

436
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,550
And yours too.

437
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,802
I tell my story

438
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,471
but if you don't use your imagination

439
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,556
how can you see the picture?

440
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,518
But you gotta give the credit to the storyteller.

441
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,687
I'm an actor, remember that.

442
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,398
I prefer to perform, rather than to write.

443
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,237
You know

444
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,990
I once thought about writing

445
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,701
jotting down events and feelings, like Rain did.

446
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,829
I even bought this notebook.

447
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,541
But until now, I haven't written a word.

448
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,799
But you post on social media instead.

449
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,426
Nope

450
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,553
I use that for peeking

451
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,138
not posting.

452
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,890
Are all actors like you?

453
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,309
Telling stories about others but keep their own hidden?

454
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,438
Are you trying to insult me?

455
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,773
No, I'm just curious.

456
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,444
Why didn't I think about taking up acting or theatre?

457
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,904
Can you teach me sometime?

458
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,241
Okay

459
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,661
but I'm strict.

460
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm a reaper.

461
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,461
You think that scares me?

462
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,718
Can I make my wish?

463
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,096
You still haven't told me why Rain and Mek broke up.

464
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,141
Rain didn't write it down.

465
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,478
What I know is that Mek broke it off

466
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,271
and Rain was heartbroken.

467
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,866
Use that imagination of yours to help me visualize.

468
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,961
What is it?

469
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,177
Rain...

470
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,889
let's end it.

471
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,895
What do you mean?

472
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,148
I...

473
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,904
have someone else.

474
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,533
Are you for real?

475
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,747
Since when?

476
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,167
For a while.

477
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,628
Can you tell me

478
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,880
who?

479
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,467
And...

480
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,679
you're sure you wanna know?

481
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,009
Rain was heartbroken, until he met me.

482
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,346
So Rain thought you could replace Mek.

483
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,682
I thought so too

484
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,018
like I said...

485
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,855
Sometimes I look into his eyes

486
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,275
and I don't see myself there.

487
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,653
But it was Mek.

488
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,006
Wait, I have a question.

489
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,090
What?

490
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,425
So in the end

491
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,219
did Mek really have someone else?

492
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,013
Not bad...

493
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,140
your question.

494
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,434
The answer is...

495
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:09,685
Yes.

496
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:10,811
Who?

497
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,897
He had the people.

498
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,149
Rain found that out later.

499
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,569
A true ideologist...

500
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,821
I'm starting to respect him.

501
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,992
If you're saying that a person who wants to change society

502
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,329
to suit his own belief is an 'ideologist'

503
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:34,585
then what about me struggling everyday to earn a living by doing what I love

504
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:39,423
just trying to fit in this society and be happy is not considered to be an 'ideal' right?

505
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,095
I believe we need to adapt to make it as a society.

506
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,347
But Mek...

507
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,724
he fights against society.

508
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,108
Am I really going to erase him from this world?

509
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,236
But that's your job, isn't it? Mr. reaper.

510
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:05,908
I told you that I thought about it carefully this time.

511
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,287
It will not cause repercussions for us to regret later.

512
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,372
How so?

513
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,460
He's already gone.

514
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,048
You just make it so he never existed in this world in the first place

515
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,260
Now I'm confused.

516
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,930
After Rain started dating me

517
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,810
there was news that Mek disappeared.

518
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,104
What do you mean, disappeared?

519
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,023
Yeah

520
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,483
disappeared.

521
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,158
I don't know if he ran away

522
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,202
or if someone... made him vanish.

523
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,582
So, when he broke up with Rain, it was to save Rain.

524
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,543
Probably.

525
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,299
Then, do I have to make someone who has already disappeared disappear again?

526
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:05,926
Yes, that's right.

527
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,345
It's because of that darn Mek.

528
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,931
Even though he's gone, He still exists in Rain's memories.

529
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,018
You know what?

530
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,397
If someone really did make him disappear, those people are evil.

531
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,693
But you... you're going to make the world forget that he ever existed.

532
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,571
You're even more evil!

533
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,510
Here comes the hour of evil.

534
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,309
I wish to...

535
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,296
Today is the 9th of february 2023

536
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,716
it will be five days until valentine's.

537
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,760
That guy Earth has disappeared.

538
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,097
Maybe today my duty might be over.

539
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,560
No Earth, no Air, everything back to the way it was

540
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,898
as if the clouds have parted and the sun is back to shine.

541
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,943
Welcome, happy chocolate's day!

542
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:47,945
What would you like sir?

543
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,322
Is this a joke?
