1
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,450
Thanatos! Your past is dark, so very dark.

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,535
I thought you would desert me as well.

3
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,370
I don’t want you to be like me.

4
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,497
Be like what?

5
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:24,876
I'm breaking the rule. Tell me, who do you want to erase next?

6
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,419
this….Politics.

7
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,254
You want me to erase Pathai Pitakseri?

8
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,673
Looks like you are ready to go.

9
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,385
Rain! I miss you.

10
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,263
Marriage with benefits. It’s a world where we have to look out for our interests.

11
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,473
Even us…

12
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,225
friends with benefits.

13
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,670
Hey, Sunshine, off to work?

14
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,629
Yes…

15
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,797
What have you been up to?

16
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,676
I did some shopping. Things are so expensive these days.

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,346
I’m not familiar with this new look of yours.

18
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,351
Going out to face the world one must act accordingly,

19
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,019
otherwise they’ll think you’re crazy.

20
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,982
Do you care about what people think?

21
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,110
No, it just bores me.

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,573
When walking the street and people look at you like a weirdo

23
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,534
just because you don't conform like the rest, It’s so tiring,

24
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,539
so I conform and become boring like them,

25
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,958
confusing huh? That’s life.

26
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,127
It sucks.

27
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,128
How are you doing, sunshine?

28
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,715
Today everything seems to be going according to plan.

29
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,634
Q!

30
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,260
You crafty cupid - you…you

31
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,303
Wait.

32
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,013
Don’t be upset with me,

33
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,183
mind the kids

34
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,953
That girl is going to send some kind of signal.

35
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:33,106
Did you know, No matter who we erase from this world, the thing that will never change

36
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,734
is the delicious food that will never disappear

37
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,280
and will never run out.

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,079
You’re so greedy, didn't you receive any alms?

39
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,916
You always mention these things. seriously,

40
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,085
When you were a kid, did you study science?

41
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:54,794
Yeah,

42
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,257
But you’re not going to tell me all that has happened -

43
00:04:59,257 --> 00:04:59,841
No,

44
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,551
that’s not what I’m saying.

45
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,139
There’s so much in the universe that we don’t know of.

46
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,226
Some things are still unclear and vague.

47
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,398
We can’t even explain all of nature, Einstein himself was stumped.

48
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,316
Enough.

49
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,361
Don’t bring up Einstein or whatever, I’m not hearing that.

50
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,906
Right now what I want to know is how did this happen?

51
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,202
What do you mean, the new social structure?

52
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,081
That’s another thing. But the real matter is...

53
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,418
how did Rain and I become friends with benefits?

54
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,130
And worst than that...

55
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,592
he’s going to marry someone else

56
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,803
It’s the same matter, you cannot separate these two subjects

57
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,055
Explain.

58
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,600
Have you ever thrown a rock into water?

59
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,603
It creates a ripple that gets bigger,

60
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,772
or you can say it’s a wave.

61
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,651
It’s the same, but I’m not sure what kind of wave it is.

62
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,326
To simply put it, it affects one another.

63
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:13,373
That’s the probability, maybe yes maybe no.

64
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,957
Oh, brain ache!

65
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,001
Can you just make it easier?

66
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,252
Okay, okay

67
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,797
It’s too much of my subconscious talking.

68
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:26,344
I will put it in layman’s terms which is that without Pathai Pitakseri

69
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,014
you and Rain never had that first argument,

70
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,808
more than that,

71
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,979
as Pathai no longer exists it affected everything.

72
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,735
Not just your life but the way people think.

73
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,948
Isn't that good? Without him, no one questioned the rules.

74
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,116
As you can see,

75
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,410
society is in proper order

76
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,705
Shit,

77
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,541
this is insane!

78
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,002
Nobody dares to stand out and be different,

79
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:05,758
everyone has to be all the same, living in a frame

80
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,763
You knew this was going to happen didn't you?

81
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,558
I told you, I don’t.

82
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,017
But it looks like you do.

83
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,019
Every time, like you knew.

84
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,896
You’re not here to help me

85
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,484
but you're just playing with my sanity with this crazy wishing game.

86
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,612
Calm down, you're losing your temper again.

87
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,576
Can I take back the wish I made before?

88
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,621
That Rain didn't know you so you can start again?

89
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,290
Yes, I want to start again.

90
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,834
Sorry. You’ve lost that opportunity.

91
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,751
Why?

92
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,044
Who makes the rules?

93
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,421
I’ve warned you.

94
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,965
You stood your ground by making that wish

95
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,720
and you’ve passed the point of no return.

96
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,648
How many chances do I have left?

97
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,194
Four.

98
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,884
Where shall we go next?

99
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,971
We don’t get this chance often - a world of total order.

100
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,392
Maybe not totally, look at that.

101
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,527
A disruptor of the system, Let’s get a seat.

102
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,669
People will never know.

103
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,507
we thought we knew better.

104
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,304
Question with everything in the sky

105
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,518
Assign meaning to fate

106
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,898
That person is so big.

107
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,820
To see what's around it

108
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,576
Forget to look at the diversity of life.

109
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,744
How much do you see?

110
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,789
What do you know?

111
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,916
Damrong.

112
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,796
What is it that we cannot see?

113
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,594
It is equally possible to live or die.

114
00:09:56,178 --> 00:10:00,558
That cat in the box lives forever.

115
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,438
Or decay and extinguish with time

116
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:11,277
I used to think that I was big.

117
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,156
Thinking that the sky is far away, it's close to it.

118
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,621
Soaring into the sky, challenging the sun…

119
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,790
Why are they chasing him off?

120
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,835
Maybe he’s disturbing the order.

121
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,879
It’s a public place.

122
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,713
Take it easy,

123
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,842
remember that we’re in a different world now.

124
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,390
This is terrible, I never imagined this.

125
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,395
Such a shame. I really liked his song.

126
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,569
I didn't get all of it, but you had to admit he was an artist.

127
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,074
For you, what does it mean to be an artist?

128
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,497
A special person who sees what others can’t.

129
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,292
And you, are you not an artist?

130
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,255
If you want to put it plainly, I probably am.

131
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,760
But the real meaning - I’m not even near it.

132
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,849
But here there are no more artists.

133
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,397
What a shame.

134
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,191
A real shame.

135
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,569
Where shall we go?

136
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,658
Away from here.

137
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,100
I’ll be back ladies, just a sec.

138
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,152
Taetae, lunch is ready.

139
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,661
You’re back,

140
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,750
what are we having?

141
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,420
Fruit salad and orange juice.

142
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,632
Did you do it according to the recipe?

143
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,011
All done. Everything is sprinkled with pepper

144
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,806
So to give a new taste to life.

145
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,557
Thanks,

146
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,603
and how was it out there today?

147
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,485
The same, all in order. Nothing’s changed.

148
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,468
How is it?

149
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,851
This strawberry is sweet,

150
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,854
sweet like...

151
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,524
strawberry

152
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,360
the pepper didn’t really help.

153
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,319
More pepper then?

154
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,112
No,

155
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,411
I’m probably bored of pepper.

156
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,206
If you need anything…just let me know.

157
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,336
Get going and go do what you need to.

158
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,884
I was thinking of giving the girls something to drink

159
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,136
and hang out with them for a bit.

160
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,847
Then I’ll play some music to send them to sleep.

161
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,644
Then after I’m going to check on my grandmother, she’s not feeling so well.

162
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,232
What's wrong with her?

163
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,239
Just old age, she’s really feeling it this year.

164
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,453
I think we’re like flowers,

165
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,291
good thing we get to bloom longer than they do.

166
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,927
Okay, make sure to close up shop.

167
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,138
Put up the sign when you’ll be back

168
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,266
in case some customers drop by.

169
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,393
Yes sir.

170
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:44,193
And be careful, don't do anything weird in case someone sees.

171
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,530
Don’t worry, you can count on me.

172
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,125
You’re much smarter than I am Jared.

173
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,758
Am I going to get all seven roses?

174
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,845
It’s an interesting question.

175
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,056
If you know something why not tell me.

176
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,227
Would you listen if I did?

177
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,938
At least I get to know about it.

178
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,733
You’d know but you don’t care.

179
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,445
You just do as you please like the way you use your wish to rid Pathai instead of using the chance to -

180
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,446
Okay, okay

181
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,781
I made a mistake.

182
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,908
Again and again.

183
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,037
Is it your job to keep reminding me or what?

184
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,293
Tell me, in that heaven or hell of yours who is the big boss,

185
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,630
Zeus, Hades, Brahma, Satan or who?

186
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,215
Why?

187
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,092
You’re going to negotiate with them?

188
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,889
I just want to know who you’re working for,

189
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,018
or are you just playing around.

190
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,856
Listen and remember this,

191
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,525
I’m not playing around.

192
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,527
Who do you answer to?

193
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:55,741
Karma, nature, God, all correct.

194
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:56,992
Who are you exactly?

195
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,036
Have you thought of who you are erasing tonight?

196
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,097
Hello Elsa,

197
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,767
Not yet, I sleep late,

198
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,271
what?

199
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,940
A play?

200
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,360
No, I want to take a month off, taking my guy on a vacation…

201
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,200
when is the play?

202
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,285
In May?

203
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,996
No,

204
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,041
I’m free…

205
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,336
yes

206
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,089
I can go for a read,

207
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,467
yes thank you.

208
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,818
A job?

209
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,614
It’s Elsa. She finds me work.

210
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,952
Even though I told her I wanted a break to take a vacation.

211
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,539
Well, nothing is for sure, you should take it,

212
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,750
better than doing nothing and just being stuck in your own head.

213
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,712
Bad mouth. I still have a shot,

214
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,301
the job is not until another two months

215
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,845
but Elsa wants me to audition tomorrow.

216
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,263
Are you going?

217
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,600
I already gave her my word.

218
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,020
I want to come, I want to see you perform.

219
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,063
It’s just an audition

220
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,692
to find actors,

221
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,777
I don't even know if they will pick me.

222
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,030
Yeah? What's' the play?

223
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,242
Oh yeah, forgot to ask.

224
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,745
In case they have a role I can try.

225
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,418
A crafty guy like you should play the villain.

226
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,712
Sure, Mr. Lead role.

227
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,384
So can you tell who the lead will kill off tonight?

228
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,511
That’s a scary way to put it.

229
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,223
“ Kill ”

230
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,390
Yeah,

231
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,603
The truth is scarier than that, ‘cause it’s worse than death.

232
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,108
Meen.

233
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,569
What?

234
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
Meen,

235
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,575
his close friend.

236
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,373
So cruel,

237
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,750
you’re worse than I thought.

238
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,795
because I can’t go back to change the slip up I made the other night.

239
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,297
It’s not just the night before, you slipped up from the beginning.

240
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,424
Quit the smart comments and do your job,

241
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,429
if I can’t go back then I’m going to erase, erase everything in this goddamn world.

242
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,575
I’m worried about you.

243
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,338
Do you remember the first night I met Rain?

244
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,090
At that bar.

245
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,258
Yes.

246
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,012
The bar where Meen was singing.

247
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,307
We drank until it closed.

248
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,228
Rain invited me and Meen to go get some food,

249
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,566
we came outside, Rain went to get the car

250
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,484
and I stood waiting with Meen.

251
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,911
Rain told me you were an actor?

252
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:10,871
Yes.

253
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,040
And you’re looking for material?

254
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,583
Yeah.

255
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,126
And you found it?

256
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,794
I think so.

257
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,256
Say, what’s your name?

258
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,424
Sunshine.

259
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,303
Sunshine

260
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:32,059
on my shoulders makes me happy…

261
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,814
I hope that my friend is not material for your acting studies.

262
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,290
Let’s go, I’m hungry.

263
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,274
Rain and I have been friends since elementary school.

264
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,318
We’re so close people think we’re a couple.

265
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,030
That’s funny, sometimes Meen would pretend to be my girlfriend when someone tries to hit on me

266
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,909
So I don’t get any because they think I’m with him.

267
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,495
And are you with anyone?

268
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,373
No one dared to try yet.

269
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,667
You’re better off just being with me.

270
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,546
And what about when you get a guy? You expect my pillows to keep me company at night?

271
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,215
Aww, I never left you on your lonesome have I?

272
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:49,678
You did sometime, but I can’t be there when you’re with your guy can I?

273
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,265
I get it now,

274
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,560
the person that sticks with you through thick and thin is not the boyfriend

275
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,019
but the best friend.

276
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,077
Hey, come on, what the hell? Don’t get all dramatic…

277
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,454
Let's eat.

278
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,420
Thank you.

279
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,513
His closest friend.

280
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,350
They’re so close that sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be there.

281
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,106
When Rain has something on his mind he would tell Meen rather than talk to me.

282
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,902
And one of the things he talked to Meen about was you.

283
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,029
Exactly.

284
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,865
And did you know what Rain said about you?

285
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,495
Well...

286
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,039
probably my bad sides.

287
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,000
Bad sides? Such as?

288
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,421
Well, the things he kept saying,

289
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,508
I’m immature, wayward and unreasonable.

290
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,761
And What did Meen say?

291
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,096
Probably told him to stop seeing me.

292
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,224
This is your intuition?

293
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,726
I’m kinda’ certain.

294
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,228
You’re kinda’?

295
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,772
Okay…

296
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,940
I’m sure of it.

297
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,485
You know that Rain is still recovering from his breakup?

298
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,196
I know about it.

299
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,115
It took him a while,

300
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,785
did you know what he went through?

301
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:38,828
Yes.

302
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,290
I try to spend as much time with him,

303
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,753
when I go singing I bring him with me

304
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,838
because I don't want him to be alone.

305
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:51,716
Yes.

306
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,638
Last time I warned him that it won’t last,

307
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,932
this love that he wants.

308
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,768
And...

309
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,938
did you warn him again this time?

310
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,942
Do you think I should?

311
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,906
I think…You should tell yourself

312
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,492
not to get involved in your friends life choices,

313
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,745
your friend found a new guy, you should be happy for him

314
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,666
because you can't find anyone yourself.

315
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,798
You said that?

316
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,135
No, I thought about it,

317
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,722
what I really said …

318
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,435
What do you think? Should I tell him?

319
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,271
You should.

320
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,023
You should tell him that...

321
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,818
he has found a guy who will always take care of him

322
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,862
and he shouldn't leave him.

323
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,659
Here’s our signature drink.

324
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,542
So what of it?

325
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,045
I still got dumped,

326
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,506
I really want to know What Meen said to him.

327
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,050
They’re best friends.

328
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,470
Right, Best friends,

329
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,183
but to think of it, Meen Loves and protects him.

330
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,520
Have you ever loved a friend that much?

331
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
No.

332
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,574
And do you have any friend that feels that way about you?

333
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,998
No.

334
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,711
Because you don’t have any friends.

335
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,632
So you don’t know the importance of true friendship.

336
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,175
Right?

337
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,097
And you still have the heart to erase her.

338
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,855
Can you suggest another way out?

339
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,075
Sorry,

340
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,161
I can’t.

341
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,625
Then it’s settled.

342
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,095
I’m sorry.

343
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,731
Sorry for who,

344
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,025
for me?

345
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,737
or Meen?

346
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,073
For everyone,

347
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,870
you, Meen and...

348
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,330
Rain.

349
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,167
Wake up already.

350
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,253
Leave me alone.

351
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,548
It’s getting late Mr.Sunshine.

352
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,560
What’s up with my phone?

353
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,478
Maybe you just forgot to charge it.

354
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,023
Looks like it.

355
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:04,737
Hey, where did you sleep?

356
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,783
In here, like every night.

357
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,577
Like every night??

358
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,328
Why are you freaking out?

359
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,122
We’ve slept in the same bed four nights already.

360
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,165
Four nights??

361
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,003
It’s because you’re too involved with yourself

362
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,796
You never noticed me.

363
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,258
True, when it hits midnight, I just fall asleep straight away,

364
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,135
and...

365
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,181
I have to carry you to bed every night, take your clothes off…

366
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,433
You…

367
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,685
Oh stop being such a little sissy,

368
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,770
I didn't try anything

369
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,939
Nothing down there is damaged.

370
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,608
Damn you!

371
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,942
Hurry up and take a shower.

372
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,695
You have to go check on the wish that you’ve made.

373
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,864
And don’t forget about your audition,

374
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,159
and after you have to take me to eat something good

375
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,328
you still haven't taken me to eat the beef pad gaprow.

376
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,414
When did you become my manager?

377
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,458
You can hardly do anything by yourself,

378
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,544
You’re lucky that I’m managing you for free.

379
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,300
The flower guy is here.

380
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,691
Good morning.  Happy February the 11th.

381
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,568
I have bought you Emily.

382
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,696
Good morning, thanks.

383
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,326
Mary, Nancy, Rosie, Judy You guys okay?

384
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,536
They’re fine.

385
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,874
Can I go in and say hi to my girls?

386
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,754
Yeah, come in.

387
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,466
Hello, ladies..

388
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,596
oh Mary, you’re withering.

389
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,308
I’ll tell you a secret

390
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,271
if you want the girls to live longer,

391
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,232
you make sure the water is clean

392
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,360
and add some sugar to give them some sweetness.

393
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,280
They love sugar, that's what makes them sweet

394
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,783
and beautiful and also add some crushed paracetamol,

395
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,619
beautiful people are prone to headaches

396
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:23,584
and add a penny, the copper from the coin will slow down the withering, no need for botox.

397
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,592
Flowers are like people,

398
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,972
they need love and care so they will stay with us for longer

399
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,363
But now my grandmother is not so well,

400
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,159
she’s withered and gets headaches,

401
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,953
the paracetamols don't help,

402
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,374
but don’t worry I dont make her take sugar or any copper.

403
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,298
What’s wrong with your grandmother?

404
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:17,013
My gran…it’s just old age, getting older everyday.

405
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,309
You must love her a lot.

406
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,562
Most in the world.

407
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,819
I wish that your grandmother gets better and lives a long good life.

408
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,992
Thank you…

409
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,869
Take good care of her.

410
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,256
Can you grant people wishes to make them better?

411
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,262
It would be great if I did.

412
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:29,460
Here i Am , How many people do we have…oh 45 people already,

413
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:38,010
Hello Aiai, Hi balloon, Hello mushroomman, Hi tootsie and Mr. Romanov

414
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:42,265
It’s me Krod here of Acid rain.

415
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,770
As we promised, today is the 11th of february, not far now till valentine,

416
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,898
Do you have refuge from the PM.25 to celebrate valentine's day?

417
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,152
If not, Don't forget about Acid Rain okay?

418
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,821
Let's look at the comments.

419
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,657
“What if I dont have anyone to celebrate with?”

420
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:08,332
You still have three more days, but if you can't find anyone - I’m available

421
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:14,422
“Trying to save my lungs from PM.25 will Acid rain Burn me even worse?”

422
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,676
Dont worry you will be safe here.

423
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,679
“I heard that acid corrodes right through”

424
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,519
No, but I can give you a good seeing to…

425
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,066
This guy here…let me introduce the new staff of Acid rain

426
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:40,489
Preaw, this angelic young man has just started work here today

427
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,993
Introduce yourself, Preaw

428
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,578
Hello, I’m Preaw,

429
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,788
I still might be practicing my coffee drips

430
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,751
but my other tricks are better than my coffee skills

431
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,378
Hey, That’s not right,

432
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,174
you have to say Acid rain’s coffee tastes good as it’s staff,

433
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,677
who out there wants to have a taste of Preaw?

434
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,263
Wait i mean Preaw’a coffee making

435
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,391
send us some hearts

436
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,770
Hey, Preaw, Is Rain in?

437
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,897
Hey, I’m doing a Live here.

438
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,026
We’re sorry.

439
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,914
The place looks kinda cool with this new design huh?

440
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,999
What would you like?

441
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,417
Iced americano please.

442
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,255
Are you new here? I don't recognise you.

443
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,758
Don’t forget, It’s not the same world anymore.

444
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,221
I’ve been working here for a while,

445
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,893
Our promotion today is

446
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,730
couples who order two of our signature drink

447
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:59,694
will get a coupon for a free drink, it’s available only on valentines day

448
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,029
But I already ordered

449
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,864
And we’re not a couple.

450
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,200
And where’s rain?

451
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,162
Rain? Who is Rain?

452
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,082
Preaw, You seen Rain?

453
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,045
Who’s Rain, and how do you know my name?

454
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,970
Are you playing tricks on me?

455
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,096
Focus

456
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,648
Rain, the owner of Rainmaker. Is he here?

457
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,780
No, because there’s no such person

458
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,911
There’s me - Krod, the owner of Acid rain

459
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,433
Damn you!!

460
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,092
Don’t forget, you still have 3 more night.

461
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,843
I can’t believe you anymore.

462
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,513
You keep waiting for me to erase more people.

463
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,557
You tricked me into killing people, You're a monster.

464
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,769
Go away, I hate you!

465
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,316
I went to see Rain at the Rainmaker.

466
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,402
But now it's turned into Acid rain.

467
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,112
Rainmaker...

468
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,864
has been closed for over 5 years.

469
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,285
And where is Ren now?
