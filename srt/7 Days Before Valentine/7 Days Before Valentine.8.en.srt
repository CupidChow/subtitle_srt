1
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,240
You've gone too far!

2
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,410
Why did you choose me? What do you want?

3
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,537
Let go! I hate you!

4
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,247
Nat.

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
Do we know each other?

6
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,168
Rain opened the place for just a year

7
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,253
and then he died.

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,548
Why didn't I see this coming?

9
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,844
Because Meen does not exist, Rain killed himself before he met me.

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,137
It has been done

11
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,848
It won't come off, No water can rid this

12
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,018
All the water from the ocean will not rid it, because it has been done

13
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,419
Let's wash away our sins together.

14
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,839
Feeling better?

15
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,978
Have you thought about who you're going to erase tonight?

16
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,440
I don't want to do it,

17
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,109
I'm scared.

18
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,320
I don't want to do it anymore.

19
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,405
And you're just going to let Rain die?

20
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,323
No!

21
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,577
But I don't know who else to erase,

22
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,537
I can't think,

23
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,373
I'm scared.

24
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you scared of?

25
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,336
What if it gets worse?

26
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,258
It can't get worse than this,

27
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,470
I don't know,

28
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,306
nothing is certain.

29
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,392
That's true.

30
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,144
Nothing is certain in this universe.

31
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,563
But you must go through with it.

32
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,524
I'm scared.

33
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,361
You have to carry on, you can't back out now.

34
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,612
I'm scared…

35
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,076
It's the point of no return.

36
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,745
I'm scared…

37
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,372
You have to carry on.

38
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,043
Please…

39
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,849
It's so dark tonight.

40
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,438
The air is so humid and there is not a single breeze.

41
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,442
We're surrounded by buildings, how can we get any wind?

42
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,696
This is the city, the people here can't even get fresh air.

43
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,868
We're lucky to have this rooftop to gaze at the moon,

44
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,415
hey, what's that?

45
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,878
What is it madam?

46
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,755
Oh nothing…I'm probably seeing things,

47
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,134
or maybe Sunshine is rehearsing a play.

48
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,993
It's almost time.

49
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,833
Have to decide who you want me to erase?

50
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,795
Can I just wish for Rain to come back to life?

51
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,341
No. Don't forget, Rules are rules.

52
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,929
You have to erase those who gets in the way of your love,

53
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,682
when you are rid of them, Rain will return to you.

54
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
I don't know who to erase.

55
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,688
You have to.

56
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,068
You're scaring me.

57
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,029
It's the only way for Rain to maybe come back.

58
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:50,905
What do you mean maybe?

59
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,033
I can't say anymore.

60
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,661
This is an evil game,

61
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,080
I sold my soul to you…

62
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,873
Now do you realise where you went wrong?

63
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,388
I ask one thing, just don't hurt yourself

64
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,392
So I have to hurt others instead?

65
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
I don't want to do this anymore.

66
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,772
You can wish for anyone to vanish,

67
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,942
any one that gets in the way of Rain returning to you,

68
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,945
as many as you wish, you don't have to mention who they are,

69
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,155
just as long as it's someone.

70
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,199
Are you crazy?

71
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,370
What if tomorrow the whole country disappears,

72
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,290
or the whole of Asia, how about the continent?

73
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,335
You still have a sense of humor.

74
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,337
Darn it!

75
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm not joking around, this isn't funny.

76
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,595
Can't you see when I erase someone it sends repercussions that are unimaginable.

77
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,185
Finally.

78
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,274
Finally what?

79
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,945
Finally you get it.

80
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,533
You knew all the time

81
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
but you just wanted to hurt me.

82
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,747
Not at all,

83
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,335
One day... You'll understand.

84
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,800
Why do you have to punish me like this?

85
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,440
Stop your whining and make a wish, It's almost time.

86
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,361
I don't know who to erase. I have no one left….

87
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,072
Just do as I suggested.

88
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,323
And if tomorrow…

89
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,033
Stop talking and make a wish.

90
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,369
I wish that...

91
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,122
whoever is in the way of Rain not returning to me

92
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,378
to disappear from this universe.

93
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,974
I'm sorry.

94
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,725
Follow me, Sun.

95
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,726
Rain!

96
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,783
Rain! Rain! Wait for me!

97
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,785
Rain!

98
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,829
He's not coming back,

99
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,333
let's go.

100
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,272
You had a nightmare?

101
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,236
What time is it?

102
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,238
Nearly six a.m.

103
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,615
You didn't sleep as much as usual.

104
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,825
I want to go see Rain.

105
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,952
Calm down. The sun's not even up,

106
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,079
you can sleep a bit more.

107
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,086
It's morning…

108
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,676
Rain is back right?

109
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,348
Do you want breakfast? Coffee and eggs.

110
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,558
I'll make it.

111
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,644
It you're up then go wash your face and brush your teeth.

112
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,814
So…

113
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,650
did anything else change?

114
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,794
Where are you going?

115
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,592
You can relax.

116
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,512
Thailand is still here and Asia is also still around too.

117
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,182
There's something that's no longer with us,

118
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,938
My phone is rip.

119
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,484
It's rip?

120
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,278
Rest in Peace

121
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,281
You'll have money to buy another one,

122
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,701
that audition you went to, your acting was really good.

123
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,869
I wasn't acting.

124
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,663
What do you mean?

125
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,247
Sorry, kinda slipped up,

126
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,124
I'm being too defensive.

127
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,961
I still don't get you.

128
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,008
Most people think that acting is all about acting

129
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,388
not being truthful, pretending otherwise,

130
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,849
but actually acting is not to act.

131
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,897
So actors with a theatre background seem natural

132
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:27,194
but also they have to remind themselves not to act in everyday life.

133
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,406
Very philosophical.

134
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,117
I still don't get it.

135
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,619
Because you yourself are acting.

136
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,582
That may be true.

137
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,211
This role was forced upon me.

138
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,759
Even though I didn't want it.

139
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,724
Who forced you?

140
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,854
Exactly, who forced me.

141
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,815
I shouldn't point fingers.

142
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,903
This could be the reason why I can't escape my own doings.

143
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,866
Karma?

144
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,743
Maybe.

145
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,663
So which religion are you from? Cupid reaper

146
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,418
Actually, Religion is not the point,

147
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,671
it's up to us to choose one or not.

148
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:39,016
If we didn't have any we would be lost.

149
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,645
Are you talking about religion or love?

150
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,199
Can love be a religion?

151
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,538
Can love save you from suffering?

152
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,961
The flower guy.

153
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,136
Sunshine, hot porridge for you.

154
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,888
Oh...

155
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,267
is this a new service? Food to go, but i didn't order it.

156
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,146
Don't say such things, I want to spread the joy.

157
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,400
The maid cooks my meals, there's plenty to go around

158
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,153
so I thought a single guy like you could do with some.

159
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,622
I'll see you later, tell me if you like it

160
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,128
and I'll tell the maid to cook for you too.

161
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,644
You want some?

162
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,021
Pork porridge from Norma.

163
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,982
You're not having it?

164
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,234
Nah, You have it.

165
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,202
She seems weird, normally she's never this kind.

166
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,538
Usually she's very stingy.

167
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,792
She looks like she cares for you

168
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,381
yummy.

169
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,926
You think everything tastes good.

170
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,849
She cares for me?…

171
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,979
why did she say I was single just now?

172
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,441
What do you mean?

173
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,985
She knows I have a guy

174
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,322
and…how come the flower guy is not here yet?

175
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,369
Q…

176
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,957
if this time things get worse than before…

177
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,812
Why are you working today?

178
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,774
My grandmother is feeling better.

179
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,068
And I thought you might need help.

180
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,030
Actually Just finish your deliveries and you can go home.

181
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,199
I got it under control here.

182
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,201
All the deliveries are done.

183
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:46,954
Just go,

184
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,623
if there's anything I'll give you a call.

185
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,337
The flowers have me here.

186
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,006
But your flowers at home

187
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,801
need you.

188
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,680
Thank you.

189
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,898
Hey, that's Jared

190
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,234
At least I can be glad that he didn't disappear.

191
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,071
Why didn't he deliver the roses?

192
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,699
His grandmother is not well.

193
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,996
You carry on ahead, I'll catch up.

194
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,455
Okay.

195
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,437
Hello.

196
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,190
The delivery man did not send the flowers today.

197
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,326
From the list…

198
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,954
he sent them to all the customers.

199
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,749
You didn't miss out anyone?

200
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,667
I don't think so.

201
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,336
You don't think so

202
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,672
No.

203
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,052
We never miss on our deliveries.

204
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,680
I think…

205
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:29,806
this is…

206
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,766
What?

207
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,187
If there was a mistake…

208
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,938
or if it was deliberate…

209
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,065
There's no mistake.

210
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,487
I think…this is too much.

211
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,656
When a murderer is sent to be executed

212
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,743
do you think the punishment is too much?

213
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,410
But he's -

214
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,203
What?

215
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,330
Different?

216
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,126
You don't want him to receive the same punishment as you.

217
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,633
But now you see how hard it is for humans to learn.

218
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,134
Your rules are inhumane.

219
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,761
No it isn't.

220
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,140
This exists because it does.

221
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,352
That's how it's always been.

222
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,065
So that's how it is.

223
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,319
You don't believe so?

224
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,907
Yes.

225
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,660
I believe….

226
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,162
But it took you so long to believe,

227
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,375
it's in front of you

228
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,214
but you can't see it.

229
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,009
Because you only see yourself.

230
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,604
We only see ourselves,

231
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,026
not even the things we've done…

232
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,823
that's why we are in this state.

233
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,829
The person...

234
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,582
that is giving you orders,

235
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,668
is he in this state?

236
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,087
or does he just give orders.

237
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,719
Yes,

238
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,222
there is another higher up

239
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,435
and another and another

240
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,438
and the highest

241
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,443
which we cannot tell if it's the highest

242
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,821
it might be a frequency,

243
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,574
a light,

244
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,243
a matter

245
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,623
or maybe it has a self

246
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,668
or it could be non-self of infinite power,

247
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,176
But they are the rules,

248
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:18,016
sometimes it makes sense sometimes it doesn't,

249
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,231
sometimes it makes us dream of heaven

250
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,196
and sometimes it scares us into living hell,

251
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,706
sometimes it tells us everything is an illusion

252
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,836
but still we can't escape it.

253
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,759
I feel sorry for him.

254
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,345
That's good.

255
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,430
How?

256
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,811
Because if you're angry with him or hate him,

257
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,314
it means you feel that way about yourself,

258
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,026
to me and all humans.

259
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,821
And…

260
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,658
If you're sorry for him

261
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,203
just as you're sorry for yourself

262
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,706
to me

263
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,002
and all humans.

264
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,719
Alas…

265
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,898
No matter what dimension we're in, no matter the universe

266
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,194
We cannot escape this,

267
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,116
so,

268
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,621
be on your way

269
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,939
What else will he have to face?

270
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,901
What will I face?

271
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,625
You don't want him to go through what you did right?

272
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,800
Then help him,

273
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,845
but...

274
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,723
don't forget about the rules.

275
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,367
give this to him,

276
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,204
the rose of the day.

277
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,205
Where have you been?

278
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,999
I thought you would have left,

279
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,584
here, take it

280
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:17,839
For me?

281
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:22,927
Where is this from?

282
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,847
From the flower shop, they forgot your delivery.

283
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,772
Take it, give it to Rain.

284
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,050
Hey!

285
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,470
What?

286
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,139
Preaw,

287
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,434
can you even make it to the chorus part?

288
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:12,852
Yeah, I can.

289
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,979
As far as I can see, you can't.

290
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,481
You wanna hear the truth?

291
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,524
Go on.

292
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,859
You weren't born for this.

293
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,696
Shit,

294
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,865
why are you trying to hurt my feelings?

295
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,159
I was the one who entered us into the contest,

296
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,953
you guys can't even read english.

297
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,955
What do you guys say?

298
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,166
It's okay.

299
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,876
Give him another shot.

300
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,758
You hear that, you get one more chance, try harder,

301
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,846
if you fail, You only have yourself to blame.

302
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,514
come on, let's go

303
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,766
What?

304
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,020
One more time.

305
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,652
five, six, seven, eight, go

306
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,114
What are they doing?

307
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,117
That's Preaw and his friends

308
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,786
Rain told me he wants to be a dancer,

309
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,623
Pure, try harder.

310
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,499
Okay

311
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,375
What do you think?

312
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,877
but he can't really dance,

313
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,651
What happened to the shop?

314
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,112
Are we at the right place?

315
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,918
Where's the shop gone?

316
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,005
Where's the shop gone?

317
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,890
Where's the shop gone?

318
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,350
Where's the shop gone?

319
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,643
- Preaw
- What the hell?

320
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
Where's the shop gone?

321
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,645
Is he mad?

322
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,647
Are you on drugs?!

323
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,272
Preaw!

324
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:21,898
I'm sorry,

325
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,816
He must be on drugs.

326
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,653
Sun enough, come to your senses!

327
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,696
Where's the shop?

328
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,573
What shop?

329
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,034
Rain's coffee shop, it used to be here.

330
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,037
You got the wrong place, this has always been an empty lot

331
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,455
Nobody opened any shop here.

332
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,123
I'm sorry kid,

333
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,251
My friend is unwell, he suffered from a trauma.

334
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,252
I'm sorry.

335
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,254
Then don't let him outside,

336
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,798
he could be harmful to others.

337
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm sorry.

338
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,592
Darn it!

339
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,385
Calm down.

340
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,886
Calm down.

341
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,889
Sun...

342
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,059
Come on, let's go guys.

343
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:56,409
What is this? What does this mean? Tell me, tell me what is going on…

344
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,038
Last night...

345
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:06,627
you asked me to erase anyone that is the way Rain coming back you,

346
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,340
that person is then…

347
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,176
Rain

348
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,542
Let's go home.

349
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,297
Let go of me!

350
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,882
Wait! Sun!

351
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,634
Sun!

352
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,791
Sun, what's the matter?

353
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,698
Q...

354
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,409
help me,

355
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm forgetting him.

356
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
I'm forgetting Rain…

357
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,275
Rain is really gone.

358
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,406
I've erased him.

359
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,206
It feels so empty,

360
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,837
not even a memory

361
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,051
Because he never existed

362
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,195
Q,

363
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,535
I'm so ashamed of myself.

364
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,621
Because you made him disappear?

365
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,084
But you didn't know that

366
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,545
it would be him.

367
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,841
I'm ashamed because I didn't know.

368
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,428
I'm so stupid,

369
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,765
I can't even see things that are in front of me.

370
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,561
I can't even see myself.

371
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,321
Humans...

372
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,656
have to lose so much

373
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,035
before they finally realize.

374
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,830
We have to lose everything we have.

375
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,669
Do you think this is fair?

376
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,838
You have finally learned.

377
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,465
Angry?

378
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,842
That anger won't do you any good.

379
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,014
You have to fulfill all the seven wishes.

380
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,559
I really can't think of anyone.

381
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,021
I remembered that his name was Rain.

382
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,233
Two more chances left,

383
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,028
do you want to know what he wished for?
