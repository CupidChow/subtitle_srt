1
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,109
Action!

2
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,399
Can I see a man?

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,243
Cut.

4
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,370
Okay, Jeffrey,

5
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,663
you got to move a little bit

6
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,039
more seductively

7
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,375
in sunshine.

8
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:05,792
Please.

9
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,876
Spread your arms

10
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,419
like an angel that you are.

11
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,420
Okay?

12
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,922
Jeff.

13
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,299
So We'll do one more time.

14
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,509
Okay, but

15
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,301
What I need

16
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,096
Try to show you my expression

17
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,139
How you feeling?

18
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:19,931
Okay?

19
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:20,557
Okay.

20
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,224
Thank you.

21
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,268
Yeah. They ready? One more time, Please...

22
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,478
Stand by.

23
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,022
What?

24
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,156
Jeff So...

25
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,575
Yes, absolutely

26
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,993
Good!

27
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,832
Jeff it's got to have it, you got it?

28
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,251
Yeah, I got it. Great. Dante's Inferno.

29
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,211
Just a little bit more Thai and erotic

30
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,880
I suppose. Right?

31
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,381
Exactly right.

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:54,924
Okay.

33
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,217
Let's get rolling.

34
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,013
Camera ready.

35
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,972
Action.

36
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,104
Cut.

37
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,315
Okay, see you guys in seven days.

38
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,525
That is a wrap

39
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,278
Finally.

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,906
Seven days.

41
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,242
Seven days,

42
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,648
I'm here.

43
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,027
Just done, omw.

44
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,034
Final poster, billboard will also
be revealed on the fourteenth

45
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,327
same day as the event.

46
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,203
Jeff will finish his concert in Korea

47
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,289
And fly back here right away on that day.

48
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,458
Make sure he will be Faust

49
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,168
not a K-pop idol.

50
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,294
Oh!

51
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,211
it's you.

52
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,254
Mephistopheles.

53
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,547
I like your acting.

54
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,048
Thank you.

55
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,424
I like his abs.

56
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,927
We will literally spray the fragrance of "Devil"

57
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,971
all over Bangkok's shopping district where the sample

58
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,139
will be distributed...

59
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,058
Make sure they can make it on time.

60
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,310
Of course. We have 7 days!

61
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,336
Hey, Jeff

62
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,047
You did a fantastic job. Thank you very much.

63
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,006
See you again.

64
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,425
On the fourteenth. The event is on the fourteenth

65
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,178
Valentine's Day Jeff. We need you!

66
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,805
We are very busy, we've got to go.

67
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,556
bye guys.

68
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,908
Not going to the party with us, Sunshine?

69
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,910
No, thanks, Elsa.

70
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,579
you got a date, I bet

71
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,917
Wanna surprise him a bit.

72
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,879
Thanks for choosing me, though.

73
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:07,051
In 7 days your face will be
all over the billboards in Bangkok.

74
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,304
You can't really see my face. Who will recognize me?

75
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,975
Oh come on

76
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,769
one day the light will shine on you

77
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,479
trust me

78
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,439
and...

79
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,525
aren't you coming to the launch on the 14th?

80
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,777
I have to travel that day.

81
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,113
Well

82
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,073
maybe someone might want to know

83
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,160
who this hot-bod Devil is -

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,994
Oh

85
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,083
ONCE Devil fragrance.

86
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,211
Here,  give this to your boyfriend.

87
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,754
But no box though

88
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,967
it's not on sale until the 14th, all over Asia.

89
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,427
Thank you.

90
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,596
Gotta go

91
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,222
running late.

92
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,684
Come along if you change your mind

93
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,728
same place

94
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,563
We'll probably be there until it closes.

95
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,775
Take this with you.

96
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,280
In case you wanna spice things up

97
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,073
with your guy

98
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,951
When it comes to that...

99
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,788
I'm hotter than the devil himself.

100
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,645
I'm on my way.

101
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,358
Coming right at 'cha.

102
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,298
Do you have a big red rose?

103
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,634
We only have small ones for now.

104
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,970
If they get a good sleep tonight

105
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,347
by tomorrow morning

106
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,682
they will...

107
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,851
How many would you like?

108
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,061
Just one please.

109
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,895
I'm in a hurry.

110
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,397
"Not for sale!"

111
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:42,910
Oh

112
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,829
this place is a bar?

113
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,457
I thought you sold flowers.

114
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,042
No, you're not wrong.

115
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,253
We sell liquor and flowers.

116
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,090
But both of these things are not for sale

117
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,634
to those who do not have the time.

118
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,264
Please

119
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,057
I just want to buy some flowers for my boyfriend.

120
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,517
I've never got him flowers before.

121
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,603
I got off work late,
and he's waiting at the restaurant,

122
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,980
I ran here, and it started raining...

123
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,441
Darn it - rain in February.

124
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,859
Please bro

125
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,405
How about this one?

126
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,199
big enough to stand the rain

127
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,285
Marie!

128
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,245
She just bloomed a moment ago.

129
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,874
She loves the rain.

130
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,001
Thank you.

131
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,172
Hey, can I...

132
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,592
Ask you guys to send it to my boyfriend every morning

133
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,552
until Valentine's day?

134
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,428
No.

135
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,597
Why not?

136
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,017
A guy that pays someone else to pick

137
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,977
and arrange the flowers

138
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,646
for his lover every morning

139
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,483
while he sleeps away

140
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,943
not caring whether

141
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,321
the flower are beautiful or wilted...

142
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,658
is that what you called love, young man?

143
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,704
Uh,

144
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,835
then can you pick the most beautiful rose
and send it to me everyday

145
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,254
so I can give it to my boyfriend myself?

146
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,340
Jared

147
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,717
get his address

148
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,805
and bill him.

149
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,181
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,058
Pass Marie to me.

151
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,478
I'll dress her up well.

152
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,652
Marie?

153
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,323
Jared names all of his roses.

154
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
What an unusual place

155
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,294
Liquor and flowers...

156
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,547
never thought they could go together.

157
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,259
Flowers makes you high...

158
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,137
liquor makes you see the truth.

159
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,682
Have you ever heard of that?

160
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,716
This is just the first one

161
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,968
more later tonight

162
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,137
get ready.

163
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,974
Hey, have you ordered?

164
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,310
Order whatever, my treat today.

165
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,605
All you eat is Beef pad kaprao with fried egg.

166
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,149
Try something else.

167
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,277
Um...

168
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:46,779
Sun...

169
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:47,905
I know that

170
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,075
I've been busy with work lately

171
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,493
and never have time

172
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,328
to help you at the shop.

173
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,539
But I'm not going to take any more jobs for a month.

174
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,377
In 7 days, there's a launch event
for the perfume that I shot today

175
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,337
but I'm not going.

176
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,965
Oh, they gave me one.

177
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,386
Here, you have it.

178
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,597
I'm allergic to perfume.

179
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,602
Oh... right

180
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,731
Even if I don't go

181
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,900
they'll find someone else to replace me anyway.

182
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,151
At the shoot today

183
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,404
all I did was look to the side and look up.

184
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,281
The whole day!

185
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,952
And the director just wanted me to look up
and spread the wings like this.

186
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,122
Life sucks!

187
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,124
So I'm not going.

188
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,126
You know why?

189
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,212
Cos it's Valentine's Day.

190
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,506
And...

191
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,842
the next surprise...

192
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,969
is...

193
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,099
we're going to celebrate Valentine's Day in the snow!

194
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
I don't think I can go...  Sun.

195
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,274
Why not?

196
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,026
Are you worried about the shop?

197
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,819
You said yourself it's doing well now.

198
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,654
Just let the staff take care of it.

199
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,072
It's only a few days.

200
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,034
You're not the barista.

201
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,661
I worked hard to get the money to take you on this trip.

202
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,955
Aren't you a bit surprised at least?

203
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,123
geez

204
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,500
Sun...

205
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,129
let's break up

206
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,341
Are you kidding?

207
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,259
It's not funny.

208
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm serious.

209
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,941
Wait...

210
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,279
I'm confused.

211
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,783
I've been thinking about it

212
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,076
while we didn't see each other...

213
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:57,910
I have been working...

214
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,078
Sun, let me finish

215
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,080
what I'm saying is...

216
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,749
that while we didn't see each other

217
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,959
it made me more certain.

218
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,252
Certain about what?

219
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,214
I...

220
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,009
don't love you anymore.

221
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,013
What?

222
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,723
Why?

223
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,933
because of what?

224
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,689
There's no reason ...

225
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,565
I don't want to...

226
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,233
Since when?

227
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,400
For a while.

228
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,194
when was this 'or a while'

229
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,403
It was for a while.

230
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,197
I can't tell exactly when!

231
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:35,823
What?

232
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,784
Did you wake up one day
and decided you didn't love me anymore?

233
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,536
Now what do I do?

234
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,580
Go to bed, wake up and just forget about you?

235
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,791
Is it that easy?

236
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,528
Is it someone else?

237
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,495
You said there's no reason

238
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,788
well here's the reason!

239
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,040
You have someone else while I work my ass off

240
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,167
taking any job I can

241
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,918
turning my face this way

242
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,336
that way to save money so I can take you on a trip.

243
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,421
Then...

244
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,839
you surprise me with this shit.

245
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,257
Sun, don't get worked up.

246
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,383
Let's be civil...

247
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,384
Be civil?

248
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,260
I got cheated on and now you want me to be nice?

249
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,137
Just calm down and watch your tone.

250
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,346
How do you want me to say it?

251
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,765
Darling, when did you meet a new guy

252
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,434
is he good in bed?

253
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,060
Is it so good that you want to end this?
That's not the reason, Sun

254
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,104
I don't want to say 'cause it's pointless

255
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,523
It'll be just blaming each other.
You're the one with reason, isn't it?

256
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,151
Always having a reason for everything, and now?

257
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,195
Saying it will just hurt you more.

258
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,279
And you think it won't hurt me this way?

259
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,655
Don't raise your voice.

260
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,617
Don't you think this will hurt me?

261
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,951
I have feelings!

262
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,827
That's enough

263
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,662
Enough? What the hell!

264
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,664
Rain, Rain, Rain.

265
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,124
Let's go.

266
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,000
Rain

267
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,335
Rain, wait

268
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,004
you can't leave me like this.

269
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,051
So...

270
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,220
this dull face is the guy?

271
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,597
I knew it.

272
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,059
You said he was a customer...  and I believed you.

273
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,479
Seriously, who's the customer?

274
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,148
Who's buying and who's selling here?

275
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:36,944
Stop!

276
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,278
Stop!

277
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,529
I said stop!

278
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,406
Stop!

279
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,784
That's enough!

280
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,786
I said stop!

281
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,956
Sun! Stop

282
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,500
Sun!

283
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,377
Do you want to know the reason?

284
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,337
It's who you are!

285
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,713
You look down on others

286
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,131
you only care about yourself

287
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,424
and don't know how to be mature

288
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,842
Listen..

289
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,344
You don't really love me.

290
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,639
You just don't want to be lonely.

291
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,266
But you can't love anyone

292
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,226
because you only love yourself!

293
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,228
You want to know the reason? here it is.

294
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,021
You're the one who has to grow up.

295
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,398
Stop throwing fits

296
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,984
and ask yourself if you had any good reason at all.

297
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,527
Sun...

298
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,153
I still love you

299
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,822
but not like before.

300
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,116
Good luck.

301
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,159
Rain.

302
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,594
Hey, Preaw

303
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,804
still closing up?

304
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,222
Just finished.

305
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,932
We had a lot of customers today.

306
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,142
Finish up and go home then

307
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,393
your parents will be worried.

308
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,185
Okay.

309
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,270
Say

310
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,105
my friend and I sent our application
for the dance competition.

311
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,898
If we win, we'll get to compete in Korea.

312
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,150
Go for it Preaw.

313
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,068
You can do it.

314
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,030
Can you help me revise some moves tomorrow?

315
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,656
After we close up?

316
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,824
Hey mister

317
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,451
He has exams all day tomorrow.

318
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,869
It's alright.

319
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,079
I can come over after I'm done with the exam.

320
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,247
Thanks a lot.

321
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,790
I'll be off now.

322
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,688
How about some coffee?

323
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,065
Exam is tomorrow

324
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,733
and you have books to read.

325
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,193
No, thanks.

326
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,362
I should go home now

327
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,364
my dad must be waiting.

328
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,115
Oh, yeah

329
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,784
this afternoon he came in for coffee too.

330
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:49,826
He said...

331
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,871
you had to go to work after class this evening.

332
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,165
I was about to walk him home

333
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:56,792
but

334
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,877
he was already gone

335
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,630
He probably didn't want to bother you.

336
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,465
The house is just around here

337
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,258
he can walk just fine.

338
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,844
You have to take good care of him.

339
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,221
He'll get lonely

340
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,014
and his health is not too good either.

341
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,474
I will.

342
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,108
How have you been lately?

343
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,859
Busy - like today,

344
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,779
I had to rush to deliver an insurance policy.

345
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,074
The customers wanted comprehensive coverage.

346
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,034
You're doing better

347
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,953
than I thought.

348
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,164
People pay more attention to their health these days.

349
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,874
So I recommend

350
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,459
these benefits to them.

351
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,047
It's my form...

352
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,094
of love language.

353
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,725
Thanks for being there today.

354
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,062
But you're kinda aggressive huh?

355
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,441
I can't let him insult you.

356
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,027
Air

357
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,864
you're such a nice guy

358
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,284
I'm not the nice guy.

359
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,832
You are.

360
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,502
You make me want to be better.

361
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,882
Thanks.

362
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,927
Rain.

363
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,762
Hmm?

364
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,015
Did you do the right thing?

365
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,933
Breaking up with him to be with me?

366
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,901
Why would you think I'd be wrong?

367
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,488
Because I'm like a nobody.

368
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,079
I don't want people to judge you -

369
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,381
I don't want anyone to look down on you for -

370
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,855
Oh, I heard a sound.

371
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,357
Thought it was Preaw.

372
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,817
Preaw just left.

373
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,195
What about you Nat, why are you still here?

374
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,906
I want to try out a new bakery.

375
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,574
I was just preparing the fridge for tomorrow

376
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,285
so we have fresh pastries for the customers.

377
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,372
It's already a blessing

378
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,541
to have an award-winning barista like you working here

379
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,416
and now

380
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,876
he's even making the pastries.

381
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,045
I told him to outsource it but he wouldn't listen

382
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,048
If it's not fresh, then it doesn't taste good.

383
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,511
I'm not making enough money to give you a raise though

384
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,721
I'm just glad to do it.

385
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,268
Thanks Nat.

386
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,897
I'm just gonna go tidy the rest up now

387
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,821
I'll see you later

388
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,864
Before you go

389
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,117
can you promise me something?

390
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,451
What is it?

391
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,246
That you have to stop undervaluing yourself.

392
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,998
You're a good guy.

393
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,417
Whoever doesn't see it, it's their loss.

394
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,836
But you must see your own worth.

395
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,338
Okay

396
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,923
from tomorrow...

397
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,674
Today.

398
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,092
Right now.

399
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,053
I mean

400
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,680
when i finish my exams tomorrow I'll come -

401
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,233
No answer!

402
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,652
I called him ten times but he's not answering.

403
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,362
But look

404
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,073
he just posted on Instagram.

405
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,242
"Thank you. You are my breath of fresh air" @air_arkart)

406
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,953
How could he do this to me?

407
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,372
My life sucks.

408
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,500
My work didn't debut, and now I just got dumped...

409
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,502
I knew

410
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,879
he likes younger guys.

411
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,172
That guy is still a kid

412
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,300
fresh and tasty.

413
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,676
Guess

414
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,345
I'm not as tasty anymore

415
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,347
that's why he said I'm immature.

416
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,060
You really are immature.

417
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,645
Hey

418
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,396
I follow him on TikTok.

419
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,773
He teaches dance covers.

420
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,732
Look.

421
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,701
He's awesome!

422
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,753
I know that he and I are completely different

423
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,463
Like we're from different worlds.

424
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,215
We like different things

425
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,511
but do we have to be the same to be together?

426
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,430
Well, I've never seen people dating a ghost or an alien before

427
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,224
except in the movies.

428
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,976
Finish the drink

429
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,478
and be on your way.

430
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,938
I'm closing up.

431
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
What kind of bar closes this early?

432
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,152
This is not a bar

433
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,364
but a flower shop that sells liquor.

434
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,117
My flowers need sleep too.

435
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,369
Balance, understand?

436
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,830
Different things

437
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,165
can coexist with balance.

438
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,293
You're full of it, man.

439
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,088
You're drunk, go home.

440
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,341
I gotta take Nancy to bed

441
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,218
so I can bring her to you tomorrow.

442
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,389
What did you say before?

443
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,726
"Flowers gets you high...

444
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,353
but liquor makes you see the truth" right?

445
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,314
Now, I can see the truth.

446
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,649
I'm not drunk.

447
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,526
How about I cancel...

448
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,819
that flower order?

449
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,113
Good for you, Jared

450
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,532
reimburse him

451
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,534
But deduct the drink from it.

452
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,538
But hey, then again

453
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,123
I shouldn't return it.

454
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,000
Why should I give up?

455
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,501
No.

456
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,170
No.

457
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,797
I'm gonna get him back

458
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,133
from that dull face

459
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,304
How much is the bill?

460
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,915
Drunk ass guy

461
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,042
I won't accept it!

462
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,168
Hey!

463
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:24,836
Hey!

464
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,796
Keep it down will you?

465
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,047
This is an apartment

466
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,799
You're disturbing everyone.

467
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,341
Hey!

468
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,759
Who are you?

469
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,760
How did you get in here?

470
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,804
I am the grim reaper

471
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,849
commanded to serve you.

472
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,475
Get outta here!!

473
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,310
I'm calling the police!!

474
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,732
Calm down.

475
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,068
No need to panic.

476
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,446
Let's just talk.

477
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,947
Who are you?

478
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,823
What do you want?

479
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,450
I told you.

480
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,326
I'm the grim reaper.

481
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,703
What the hell!?

482
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,873
I suppose you think the grim reaper should have a demon head

483
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,416
like Mephistopheles

484
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,251
in the ad you shot today?

485
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,128
That's made up.

486
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,379
But this is...

487
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,133
Real.

488
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,179
What the hell are you talking about?

489
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,766
Oh wait

490
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,811
"Flowers gets you high, liquor makes you see the truth"

491
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,314
oh I get it

492
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,774
I'm just drunk.

493
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,783
If you think you're drunk

494
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,659
take a shower.

495
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,704
Or should I shower you?

496
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,707
No need!

497
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,093
Are you going to drink more?

498
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,684
So that I can see the truth more clearly.

499
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,520
What kind of grim reaper

500
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,189
looks straight out of a fashion week.

501
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,900
You appear to look human

502
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,528
but then then again you're not.

503
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,489
Because I'm no ordinary reaper

504
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,118
I am the Cupid Reaper.

505
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,456
What the hell is a Cupid Reaper?

506
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,875
I might be able to help you.

507
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,879
But it's not as easy as shooting an arrow at his heart

508
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,048
and making him come back to you.

509
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,718
You need to use logic and reason.

510
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,430
Remember?

511
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,558
That's what your ex told you tonight

512
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,937
Then what should I do...

513
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,772
sir... er...

514
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,732
Cupid Reaper.

515
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,402
How about you call me "Q"

516
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,779
Yes, Mr. "Q"

517
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,406
Don't call me mister.

518
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,908
Look at it as...

519
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,661
friends.

520
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,289
Sure, friend.

521
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,835
I'll give you the opportunity to "erase" any obstacle 7 times.

522
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,128
Put Simply

523
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,255
you can choose to "eliminate" 7 people.

524
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,217
Whoever you think that you make disappear

525
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,678
will return Rain back to you.

526
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,847
But...

527
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,806
But what?

528
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,601
But I beg you...

529
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,436
think about it carefully.

530
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,605
No need to think

531
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,106
I know who I'll erase.

532
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,399
Think. Carefully.

533
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,943
I've already chosen!

534
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,195
Calm down.

535
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,447
I know who you're going to erase.

536
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,575
That's why I'm telling you to use your reason

537
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,452
not your emotions.

538
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,121
You have until midnight.

539
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,460
Five minutes left.

540
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,670
If that's the case...

541
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,339
let's get to know each other a bit.

542
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,757
Tell me

543
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,634
are you from hell or heaven

544
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,843
and who sent you?

545
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,931
I came from somewhere between hell and heaven

546
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,100
between the past and the future.

547
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,269
Between the past and the future.

548
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,104
That's the present.

549
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,731
Our times are not the same.

550
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,608
Your present...

551
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,859
is my future.

552
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,278
What is this?

553
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,404
God?

554
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,197
Black Magic?

555
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,365
Quantum? Multiverse?

556
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,493
Can you pick one?

557
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,620
And does the world you live in

558
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,039
have anything definite?

559
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,415
Ah

560
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,792
Dharma as well.

561
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,210
Sathu.

562
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,380
Maybe...

563
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,882
everything you said...

564
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,847
might just all come together right in front of you.

565
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,058
You just can't see it.

566
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,226
Yeah

567
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,812
looks like I'm drunk out of my head.

568
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,566
Everything I know is all mixed up

569
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,610
It's human.

570
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,195
No matter how much you know

571
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,073
There's still so much you don't

572
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,867
The person I want to erase...

573
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,495
how do you make him disappear from this world?

574
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,454
This universe.

575
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,622
Right, this universe.

576
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,083
How can you make him disappear from this universe?

577
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,334
I just...

578
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,045
and he disappears.

579
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,547
That simple?

580
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,798
That simple.

581
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,591
Darn...  so easy

582
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,510
it's like how Rain stopped loving me.

583
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,470
With a snap of a finger

584
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,056
and he doesn't love me anymore.

585
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,224
Oh

586
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,392
more woe

587
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,435
here we go again.

588
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,519
I'm here

589
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,771
waiting for your order.

590
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,274
Right.

591
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,526
I have the "power" to do that.

592
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,570
I want you to call it a "chance."

593
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,697
The "power" to erase anyone

594
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,615
so that Rain will love me again.

595
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,785
You could erase anyone

596
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,330
but will you get his love back?

597
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,457
You have to really think about.

598
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,334
No matter how many times I think

599
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,210
it's still the same person

600
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,963
Do I have to pray?

601
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:02,923
Up to you.

602
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,508
You can keep your eyes closed

603
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,593
open your eyes

604
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,511
or even scream his name

605
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,679
as you wish.

606
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,440
What are you doing?

607
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,281
You're not gonna jump, are you?

608
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,079
Why would I jump

609
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,832
when Rain will come back to me tomorrow?

610
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,085
Then what are you doing?

611
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,671
Didn't you say that I can scream that guy's name?

612
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,715
You'll wake the neighbors

613
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,592
Let the whole world know!

614
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,136
You're really immature.

615
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,849
Don't say that word again!

616
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,893
I helling hate it! I don't act like a grown up,

617
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,478
and is that dull face a grown up?

618
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,854
Alright, whatever.

619
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,823
Do I make my wish now?

620
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,325
If you thought it through.

621
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,618
I thought about it.

622
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,247
Go ahead.

623
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:42,273
I want that guy 'Air' to disappear from this world!

624
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,482
Good morning, Sunshine. I brought Nancy as you asked.

625
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:07,858
Thanks.

626
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,610
you really wake up this late every day?

627
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,362
Well, look how drunk I was last night.

628
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,780
Where did you go to get drunk??

629
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,574
Good morning, Sunshine.

630
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,118
I'm not drunk... I'm not dreaming...

631
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,620
It doesn't get any more real than this.

632
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,663
Well then...

633
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,124
That dull face Air

634
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,459
is really gone.

635
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,670
I've erased him...

636
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,591
as you ordered, sir.
