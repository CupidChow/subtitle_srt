1
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,408
Welcome, happy chocolate's day!

2
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,951
What would you like sir?

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,703
When did you first meet Rain.

4
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,454
At a bar

5
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,330
How about your partner?

6
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,456
We broke up.

7
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,374
Because Rain broke up with Mek,

8
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,168
he went to that bar and met you.

9
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,796
But you still have the opportunity to win his heart.

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,881
Which means…I have to begin again.

11
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,299
You're waiting for a miracle

12
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,426
I don't see any damn good coming from you. All you're good at is talking crap.

13
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,637
- There it is, this is your true colors, this is who you really are.
- What? What are my true colors? What kind of person am I?

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,305
That's why Rain can't stand you, It's not just your boyfriend leaving you

15
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,266
Not a soul on earth would waste time on you.

16
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,871
This is a good opportunity to start again.

17
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,251
this is a chance, I still have 5 more tries and five nights right?

18
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,672
I have to warn you about something.

19
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,507
Go on.

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,094
It's important, so listen carefully.

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,554
Just say it already.

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,307
This is a good opportunity to start again.

23
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,561
But if you are choosing that…You cannot return after you do this.

24
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,647
That's right, I get the rules.

25
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,150
It's the point of no return.

26
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,485
But if it doesn't work

27
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,905
I can still return to the point where Rain breaks up with me right?

28
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,743
some people…are just hopeless, like really.

29
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,745
That's why we're people

30
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,623
and not a cupid reaper like you.

31
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,250
Yeah? and what would you do?

32
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,544
I would just tell them what to do to be happy

33
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:53,756
none of this seven nights, seven times thing, do you think this is fun?

34
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,758
That's why my title is cupid reaper!

35
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,053
If I could do that I'd have to be born as a  full fledged cupid

36
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,472
And I wouldn't have to take people's lives to fulfill your wishes

37
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,891
Do you think this is fun?

38
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,733
Can you tell me, what got your panties in a twist?

39
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,027
Are you mad at me?

40
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,574
You're never aware. It's a waste of opportunity.

41
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,577
The opportunity to start again?

42
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,956
Rain doesn't even know me anymore.

43
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,169
Rain not knowing you is good. You can start a new bond with him.

44
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,630
It's your chance to prove yourself, to do it right this time.

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,883
You told me I have five more tries so what's wrong with choosing this?

46
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,095
You don't dare to prove yourself. You don't have the courage to try. You're waiting for a miracle

47
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,348
- let me tell you that miracles don't exist.
- And do you have any miracles?

48
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,391
I don't see any damn good coming from you. All you're good at is talking crap.

49
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,979
- There it is, this is your true colors, this is who you really are.
- What? What are my true colors? What kind of person am I?

50
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,775
Blaming others, you never look in the mirror and see yourself. You never admit to your own faults.

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,818
I see myself in the mirror everyday.

52
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,153
But after you occupy my bathroom

53
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,447
- I don't get the chance to. You annoy me with all your bathing.

54
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,117
You see? There it is Blame, blame, blame, blaming everyone else.

55
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,035
So what? So what if I blame others?

56
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,080
That's why Rain can't stand you, It's not just your boyfriend leaving you

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,041
Not a soul on earth would waste time on you.

58
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,822
Mystic marbles of the Greek gods

59
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,035
that know the past, present and future.

60
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,746
Wanna try?

61
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,666
No, thank you.

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,628
For you, I'll do it for free.

63
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:03,488
Feel every marble in this box

64
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:09,118
each marble represents a Greek god.

65
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:14,123
If you feel energy from it

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,961
choose one by one.

67
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,673
The first is the past.

68
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,724
Go on.

69
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,478
Do I have to make a wish or something?

70
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,107
No need

71
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,944
just clear your mind.

72
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,923
Thanatos!

73
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:14,016
The god of death. Your past is dark, so very dark. Dark as death.

74
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,813
So dark that one cannot see at all.

75
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,274
what does that mean?

76
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,111
You have to pick another one.

77
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
For now

78
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,705
one must see the present to combine the predictions.

79
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,267
Eros

80
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,316
the god of love.

81
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:16,037
I see a hazy fog clouding

82
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,375
around this marble

83
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,337
gathering in a pink cloud

84
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,088
you...

85
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,091
are in love.

86
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,057
Death. Love.

87
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,100
Is that possible?

88
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,144
Pick another.

89
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,357
This will be the final prediction

90
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,029
of what will happen in your future.

91
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,616
Go on.

92
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,502
Behold! Dionysus! The rebirth.

93
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:10,424
Dionysus!

94
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,468
The rebirth.

95
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:20,560
I shall announce my reading.

96
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:28,609
No matter what darkness your life has been through

97
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:35,283
love will bring you new life

98
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,160
therefore,

99
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,373
be open to love.

100
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,459
Bear that in mind.

101
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,903
Hey, Q whatcha been up to?

102
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,323
And where's Sunshine?

103
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,368
Probably in his room, I just…went out to do errands.

104
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,955
Hey, did you manage to get rid of the stain?

105
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,544
Not at all. But like you said, the more I try the messier it gets.

106
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,632
So I placed a chair in front of it, do you think it works?

107
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,799
Ah…yes.

108
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,553
Just temporary. Until I can get rid of it.

109
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,805
Oh,

110
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,433
I wanted to ask

111
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,602
and don't take this the wrong way.

112
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,895
Okay.

113
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,982
Are you…and Sunshine just friends?

114
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,525
Oh, yes of course.

115
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,820
All this time, I've never met any of his friends.

116
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,823
And…I haven't seen his boyfriend lately.

117
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,951
They're both very busy.

118
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,582
Then you….must be a friend from Sunshine's line of work.

119
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,128
You have sharp eyes, But I'm not famous or anything.

120
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,049
Are you in any soaps or series that I can catch up on?

121
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,677
Criminal cupid

122
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,929
Oh, what a title

123
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,931
sounds interesting,

124
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,142
must be quite a show

125
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,019
is it on air now?

126
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,021
We're still in production.

127
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,399
When it goes on the air, please watch it.

128
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,858
Absolutely.

129
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,735
Then, please excuse me.

130
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,529
Please.

131
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,988
I thought you would desert me as well.

132
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,242
You told me to get out.

133
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,009
You wanna hear a tale?

134
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,972
What makes you want to tell one now

135
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,143
I just want to tell you.

136
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:33,979
Go ahead

137
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,449
There once was a boy.

138
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,330
He had a father, a mother and a good life.

139
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,125
He enjoyed the bedtime story that his mum told him

140
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:02,174
but then his mum stopped telling them

141
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,386
because she had to wait up for dad every night.

142
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,306
One night,

143
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,727
The boy woke up to hear people arguing.

144
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,232
It was his parents.

145
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,365
He got up and saw his dad packing his things.

146
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,660
The boy went to grab his dad's arm and ask where he was going.

147
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,541
Dad did not answer

148
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,253
he didn't even look at the boy

149
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,299
like he wasn't there.

150
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,469
And then he left.

151
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,310
The boy waited for the dad to come home

152
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,939
but then mum told the boy

153
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,777
that dad is not coming back.

154
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,697
Forget about him.

155
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,534
Forget that dad ever existed.

156
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,955
Afterwards

157
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:22,296
the boy lived with his mother, without being able to forget about his dad.

158
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,382
His mum struggled

159
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,137
taking on all jobs to survive.

160
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,766
The boy wished he had magic powers to make his mother rich

161
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,977
to have clothes, a home, a car

162
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,105
and enjoy life like all her friends.

163
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:48,405
From elementary to high school

164
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,492
the boy grew up

165
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,205
and one day

166
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,670
he saw his mum with another man

167
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,466
that is not...

168
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,096
his dad.

169
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,559
he wasn't from that town, he was from some other land.

170
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,189
The mother told the boy

171
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,027
that she was going to live with that man

172
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,030
so she would have money.

173
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,660
Living here she would never earn enough money to give the boy a good life.

174
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,664
The mother would take the money to give him a good education

175
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,291
a good future.

176
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,586
She told the boy to study hard

177
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,591
and she left…

178
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,431
He concentrated on his studies

179
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,307
waiting for news of his mother

180
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,645
waiting to talk to her.

181
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,690
Time to time she would send money

182
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:14,533
every month until he finished high school

183
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,625
she sent him a card to congratulate him

184
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,218
and she disappeared without any more information.

185
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,071
The Boy lived in that old apartment

186
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:56,492
where every turn would only remind him of the memories of his parents.

187
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:05,709
He left the place. He struggled so that he could make it in university learning about what he liked.

188
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,090
Because he still believed...

189
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,344
that all fairy tales have a happy ending.

190
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,515
With the help of an angel who grants wishes.

191
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
But it's not as easy as that.

192
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,984
I told you

193
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,197
that nothing in life is easy.

194
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,546
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

195
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,299
No need.

196
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,762
Because it's true as you said.

197
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,976
You know?

198
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,978
my life

199
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,647
is different from your tale.

200
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,316
How?

201
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,239
I'm the one that leaves.

202
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,117
I left someone.

203
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,327
Not my partner

204
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,037
not my lover

205
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,375
but it's someone that loves and wishes the best for me.

206
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,503
I was too selfish.

207
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,506
I only thought about myself.

208
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,467
I wanted the life that I could choose for myself.

209
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,012
Even if that person gave me life.

210
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,852
Before I realized, The life I wanted to live,

211
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,939
would mean nothing without him

212
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,566
if...

213
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,861
he was no longer around.

214
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,866
But I just like you, when it's time to say goodbye

215
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,121
I couldn't accept it, I was angry, I was judgmental, I was hurt and lost

216
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,374
Before I knew...

217
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,502
There's really no way.

218
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,966
And what did you do?

219
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,098
I…

220
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,478
I can only say that…

221
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,815
I don't want you to be like me.

222
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,406
Be like what?

223
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,872
I'm breaking the rule.

224
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,711
What can I do to help?

225
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,466
Tell me,

226
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,427
who do you want to erase next?

227
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,280
You want me to erase Pathai Pitakseri?

228
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,285
From the relationship diagram.

229
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,122
We began arguing because of this….

230
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,248
Here.

231
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,209
Politics.

232
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,712
I understand that this issue is…

233
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,047
dangerous.

234
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,425
Yes,

235
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,093
dangerous

236
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,681
they say religion and politics

237
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,141
avoid it if you can

238
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,644
because it divides friends and lovers.

239
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,854
But...

240
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,190
you and Rain, is it really that bad?

241
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,450
That day...

242
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,040
after the marathon

243
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,055
we sat here eating noodles.

244
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,984
Don't change it, I want to watch.

245
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,238
So that means you don't agree,

246
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:50,243
meaning the people who are gathering funds

247
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,205
you don't think that they are doing something to help others.

248
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,499
compassionism

249
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,125
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that

250
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,835
I think you are just stirring,

251
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,505
I know you want Mr. Pathai and I to -

252
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,425
Please Mr.Tewan, I would like to hear Mr.Pathai

253
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,928
Compassionism.

254
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,099
Feeling compassion for others to make us feel higher about ourselves,

255
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,392
when it's actually the responsibility of the welfare state.

256
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,686
- when it's actually the responsibility of the welfare state.
- This is boring.

257
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,480
Don't you care about these things?

258
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,191
No.

259
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,820
You're weird

260
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:27,989
Weird how?

261
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,828
WEIRD HOW?

262
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,789
Forget it, I don't want to get into it. Just let me watch.

263
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,629
So you're basically putting me on a spot

264
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,967
Let me ask you this, are our fingers even?

265
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:52,264
But Mr.Pathai said that we can reinstate basic welfare.

266
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,726
And do we not have basic welfare today?

267
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,645
But we have not reached international standards…

268
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,107
Never mind the other countries. It doesn't matter,

269
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,652
How much tax do we pay?

270
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,488
Would you pay more taxes?

271
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,990
I might be willing,

272
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,952
If paying more means I have as much privilege as you do

273
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,043
You can say that because...

274
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,546
you have a much higher income than the average person

275
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:32,387
Exactly so I'm curious about why the income gap is so far apart

276
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,644
Don't you care about society?

277
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,147
I've already told you

278
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,526
Mek and I have different means

279
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,530
So then you argued with Rain because of Pathai?

280
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,532
No,

281
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,702
I just sat down and put up with it.

282
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,507
What do you think, Mr.Pathai.

283
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,094
I believe that an equal society can be beneficial for all.

284
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:18,767
I'm not asking those with advantages to make sacrifices,

285
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,353
I just want  equality in our society.

286
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,481
- You speak as if we have no law and order.
- Please let me finish,

287
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,069
I'm talking about equality that's not just based on laws

288
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,864
or the equality in economic competition,

289
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,741
Your noodles are getting stale

290
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,327
What?

291
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,955
Finish it before it goes cold

292
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,122
Please eat some.

293
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,707
But everything has its contextual scope.

294
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,836
If you believe that welfare will give people importance

295
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,423
they might not care about making a living or being a good citizen…

296
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,925
There, That is your perspective

297
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,676
Please don't interrupt

298
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,137
Forgive me, but I have to interrupt.

299
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,681
I'm not finished

300
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:03,061
Forgive me, but I must interrupt the both of you.

301
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,396
You're ganging up on me.

302
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,940
But I must, we're on a time scope and we're digressing.

303
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,359
A moment ago Mr. Pathai mentioned basic equal rights.

304
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,986
back to Mr. Phathai.

305
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:19,160
Am I right to guess that you're talking about marriage equality that the Fair Thai party debated on the other day?

306
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,620
Please go on.

307
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:30,338
Thank you. It was an example stating that marriage equality should be a basic right for all, just as Mr.Tewan should care about human rights

308
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,673
When did I not care about that?

309
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:40,181
I saw the debate, when the subject came up I saw many honorable speakers overlooking this matter.

310
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,601
And did you hear my view?

311
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,894
I spoke after that. I support it,

312
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,690
because it's an international agreement.

313
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:54,195
I support the marriage of all genders,

314
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,992
and the right to marry shouldn't be justified by our sex.

315
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,996
We also pushed for the “life partner” legislation act, it's the best way out.

316
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,040
The life partner act is not the same as marriage equality.

317
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,249
- The life partner act is not the same as marriage equality.
- Why isn't it the same?

318
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:14,466
The fundamental of marriage equality is allowing the same sex to marriage rights.

319
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:23,892
As for the life partner act only gives the same sex the right to register as partners, and that is it.

320
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,810
You only have the right to register.

321
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,395
You're mistaken.

322
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:39,574
The details state that you can marry, look after one another, share assets and even adopt and care for a child.

323
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:49,125
If one should happen to become unwell or disabled they can give the other the right to look after their well being, even take care of their will.

324
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,505
They have all the rights, you didn't do your research and you make such claims

325
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,925
but I know what you're getting at,

326
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:01,721
he wants to change the status from male and female to ‘person' Right?

327
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:08,353
But according to the legislation it's only eligible for male and female.

328
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,521
According to the legislation

329
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,689
- According to the legislation
Of course,

330
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,607
seeing how you keep bringing up rights,

331
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:17,487
you have to respect the rights of men and women too before you decide to erase their titles.

332
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,991
Even if we change the title, men and women can still get married.

333
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,994
Let's try to understand about our rights,

334
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:32,293
men and women can live together even if they don't want to register by law as a couple and the law does not force them too,

335
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,505
They have the right not to marry.

336
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:41,469
So therefore the same sex should also have a choice to choose whether or not to marry, the same as the other sex

337
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:59,654
Also the life partner act that you support, legally they don't register as married people, so they don't have the same rights as married people have.

338
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,783
Yes but we can use the law to allow such cases.

339
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,368
Allow…

340
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,453
Of couse.

341
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,122
Okay, listen

342
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,874
Let me explain the law to you.

343
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:15,503
The law is written according to the nature of humans

344
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:27,098
and it has continued to uphold the customs and traditions that already protects the rights of men women equally,

345
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,226
and you come along and want to change things,

346
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,896
have you thought about the consequences?

347
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,857
You can't just change this and that to your demands,

348
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,526
how will it affect society as a whole?

349
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,989
What about different beliefs and religions, and there several,

350
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,200
did you consider them?

351
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,330
Change is not the answer, we live in a multicultural society.

352
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,457
What do think Mr.Pathai?

353
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,087
Culture and humanity has to move forward together,

354
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,757
as long as you're in your safe zone,

355
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:11,518
you will uphold culture but when you or someone close to you are in a same sex relationship happens to fall ill

356
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:19,692
and you need money for medical care, but they are not eligible for healthcare rights

357
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:24,322
because they do not hold the ‘married' status that is certified by law,

358
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,535
in these critical times,

359
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,039
instead of spending time taking care of them,

360
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,004
you have to instead spend your time fighting an unjust system to make the law allow such rights?

361
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:46,135
Humanity and human rights - that is equality

362
00:30:52,100 --> 00:31:04,362
There we have it. A very clear point, but we have reached the end of “Diverse views”

363
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:13,955
Thank you Mr.Tewan Wongtewa and Mr.Pathai Pitakseri and all of our audience in the studio and also online

364
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:18,042
see you again, same time next week.

365
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,515
Can we change the channel now?

366
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,244
It ended well.

367
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,830
You mean about me and Rain that night?

368
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,292
No, I mean that TV show. Mr. Phathai finished the program well.

369
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,503
Oh my.

370
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,631
Are you pro Tewan?

371
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,884
No. I'm not on anyone's side.

372
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,641
But a lot of what Pathai said, I agree with.

373
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,979
Not just the big issues like marriage equality but there are other things…

374
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,272
Like what?

375
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,066
A lot of things.

376
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,276
Like banning mandatory haircuts for students?

377
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,279
Shouldn't students have the rights to their own bodies?

378
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,073
They just want to break the rule.

379
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,618
I wanted to have long hair when I was young,

380
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,244
look at me now.

381
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,956
Because you discovered your identity,

382
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,000
which is external

383
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,126
but inside…

384
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,794
What?

385
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,337
What am I inside?

386
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,380
You stand for nothing.

387
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,048
I stand for nothing?

388
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,426
Then what do you call this, I'm my own person,

389
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,137
don't accuse me of things because I'm not taking sides in politics.

390
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,098
Let's not get into it if we're going to argue. It's not worth it.

391
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,349
Who started it? Who wanted to argue

392
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:56,975
It was you who started it.

393
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,018
- It was you who started it.
- Enough. Stop it. Stop talking.

394
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,646
It's you who is Pathai's fan club and can't take criticism.

395
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,399
It's not that I can't take it but can't we exchange decent opinions?

396
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,775
Oh please, You can't take it.

397
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,944
Everytime I mention him you get upset.

398
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,486
I'm not upset.

399
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,196
- I'm not upset.
- All this is just a role he's playing.

400
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:10,989
A role?

401
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,490
Yes. A role.

402
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,576
He's portraying a character to sell a brand.

403
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,580
Politics, marketing, Entertainment, it's all the same.

404
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,999
I don't believe in any of it.

405
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,670
Then you carry on in ignorance, not giving a thought to those who are struggling.

406
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,672
Just as long as you're comfortable

407
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,424
wait, no

408
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,136
you are also struggling everyday but won't admit that is because of this system.

409
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,138
What the hell?

410
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,890
It's just an argument in politics, why are you making a big deal out of it?

411
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,225
Are you mad?

412
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,063
Where are you going? Come back and talk it out!

413
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,319
When you're riled up, no amount of talk will help.

414
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,508
From that day on, We never talked politics again.

415
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,803
The next day he came to see me,

416
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,638
as if nothing ever happened.

417
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:23,770
I think he learned what to and what not to talk about for us to work out.

418
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,355
And what could you talk about?

419
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,691
Plenty of things.

420
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,237
In the daytime I would check

421
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,491
if he had eaten, if he was hungry,

422
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,204
when we meet I'd ask him if he's tired, was the traffic bad,

423
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,457
what he wanted to have for dinner, we go get food,

424
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:53,299
we come back to room, watch a series, feel tired, sleep.

425
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,509
That's it?

426
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,845
That's it. I know…

427
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,764
That's how life goes in this day and age.

428
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,059
But I'm not just wasting my life away.

429
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,770
I have hopes and dreams, one day

430
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,690
when I become rich and famous then my life will be much more than this.

431
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,586
You really want to erase Pathai Pitakseri?

432
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,020
Looks like you are ready to go.

433
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:22,156
Hello, here's your flower delivery.

434
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,532
Thanks.

435
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,035
Doesn't this one have a name?

436
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,540
How did you know this rose has a name?

437
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,543
Because you name all your roses don't you?

438
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,505
Yes, this is Judy.

439
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,509
But please don't tell anyone that I name my roses.

440
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:42,969
Why not?

441
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,013
I don't want people to think I'm…

442
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,682
weird.

443
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,643
They might send me to get cured.

444
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,437
I bid you farewell, good luck.

445
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,224
Good morning

446
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,269
Whoa! I thought you were in the bathroom!

447
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,437
Who's in there?

448
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,815
I'm just here to tell you that I'm gonna go get something to eat.

449
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,609
If you want to come with me then I'll see you -

450
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,238
Rain

451
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,491
It was just a quick shower, you miss me so much you stood waiting?

452
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,577
I told you to  take it together.

453
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,622
Of course I miss you, I miss you more than anything in the world!

454
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,920
Can you spend the whole day with me? Don't go anywhere.

455
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,882
Such a cry baby. I'm late already.

456
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,843
Please, I won't let you go ever again.

457
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,512
I can't stay, dad will tell me off,

458
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,723
I'll come back tonight and get you good,

459
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,810
I'll give you a good seeing to. Be ready.

460
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,688
We don't have to wait till tonight.

461
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,858
You can give it to me now.

462
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,444
Are you daring me?

463
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,613
Are you up to it?

464
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,134
Better not, I'm late, I have to go to work.

465
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,306
So what if you're late, the shop won't go anywhere.

466
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,809
The shop won't go anywhere for sure,

467
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,685
even after covid,

468
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,646
dad won't let me re open

469
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,190
and I don't enjoy working for his company

470
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,067
so boring

471
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,946
to carry a bag around following behind him,

472
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,450
greeting people, acting humble towards the seniors

473
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,244
when we're out bidding for civil projects,

474
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,830
But I'm his son what can I do?

475
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,418
How long has the shop been closed for?

476
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,506
Since covid, it's been three years.

477
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,008
I'm thinking about talking to dad

478
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,011
after this big project,

479
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,182
if we get it he'll be in a better mood,

480
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,687
one contractor for all the provinces.

481
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,481
He feels confident about it, the proposal was very bold.

482
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,609
Dao is also helping to convince dad.

483
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,488
Dad…Dao….

484
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,533
Dao said dad will hold power for quite a few years.

485
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,287
So he wants us to marry as soon as possible.

486
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,999
But I don't want to get married yet,

487
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,553
because then I won't get to spend time with you.

488
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,723
You're getting married?

489
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,058
Marriage with Benefits.

490
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,686
It's a world where we have to look out for our interests.

491
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,814
Even us…friends with benefits.

492
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,734
Friend with Benefits?

493
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,197
The difference is that marriage with benefits is for the money

494
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,075
but friends with benefits what you get is…

495
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,996
I can't believe it, you're getting married.

496
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,791
It's just the rules of society.

497
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,629
We haven't progressed enough to be able to accept something different.

498
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,963
How could this happen?

499
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,716
It happened, it's been like this for a long time

500
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,512
and we've been okay with it

501
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,306
if you don't think about it too much.

502
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:00,851
Okay,

503
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,728
I have to go,

504
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,314
what's up for tonight?

505
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,196
I..

506
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,199
I have a shoot

507
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,535
Suit yourself.

508
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:18,661
Oh,

509
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,914
when you're done and it's not too late, give me a call.

510
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,585
But don't call during the evening incase

511
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm having dinner with Dao.

512
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,409
Right now what I want to know is how did this happen?

513
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,744
the new social structure?

514
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,121
That's another thing.

515
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,206
But the real matter is...

516
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,376
how did Rain and I become friends with benefits?

517
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,253
Have you ever thrown a rock into water?

518
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,339
It creates a ripple that gets bigger

519
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,926
To simply put it, it affects one another.

520
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,679
How many chances do I have left?

521
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,806
Four.
