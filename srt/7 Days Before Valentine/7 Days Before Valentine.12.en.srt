1
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,880
He was a reaper like you?

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,760
Yes,

3
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,160
but different policies.

4
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
he was happy to see the boy succeed,

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,720
there’s no need to extend his time.

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,800
The boy decided to use his father’s candle to light up the extinguished candle.

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
Before blowing out his father’s candle.

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,520
Q, I wish for you to be happy,

9
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,680
I wish for you to disappear from this universe.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,880
Sun...

11
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,720
I want you to call it an opportunity.

12
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,640
You can use your power to erase anyone.

13
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,200
But will you get love back or not?

14
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
You must think carefully.

15
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,600
It's the point of no return.

16
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,000
You will not be ashamed of your sins.

17
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,840
I'll make sure you're conscious.

18
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,520
I give it to you.

19
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,960
Sunshine, this version is a lot gentler, right?

20
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,440
I made the mistake of thinking that power would make someone love me back.

21
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,520
But really, I just erase everyone.

22
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm glad you thought of it.

23
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I’m... sorry.

24
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
for everything.

25
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
You haven't done anything wrong to me.

26
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
And thank you

27
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
for everything.

28
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
I hope that you

29
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,120
find someone

30
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,920
so that you wont have to be alone ever again.

31
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Did you just give me a blessing?

32
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
I want you to find happiness,

33
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Q.

34
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,120
Happy Valentine's day!

35
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
Oh, Jared

36
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
Today is the last one, I picked the most special one for you.

37
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,720
What’s its name?

38
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,720
It doesn't have one because its special, the owner has to name it

39
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,160
Oh really? I’m not so good at naming things.

40
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,440
Then ask your boyfriend.

41
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,040
I don't have one. I’m single.

42
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,480
Oh, sorry to hear that.

43
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,840
That’s okay, no big deal.

44
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Love has its expiry date,

45
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
just like a rose.

46
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,760
Well, maybe so…I suppose.

47
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,200
Maybe so? You don’t really believe that

48
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,080
I believe roses have their time,

49
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
but I’m not sure about love.

50
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
Have you ever loved someone?

51
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,400
Yes, I love my grandmother and she loves me.

52
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,720
Not that kind of love.

53
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,000
Isn’t that considered as love too?

54
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,240
Well yeah,

55
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
that’s also love,

56
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,520
silly me,

57
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
why did I think love has just one type.

58
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,400
You’re not silly.

59
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,440
Because I only know one type of love, the type that doesn’t expire.

60
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
And do you have a gift for your grandmother?

61
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,200
I don’t.

62
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
Why not?

63
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,680
She doesn't know anything about Valentine.

64
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,240
I will just be home early to give her a kiss, that is special enough.

65
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,960
A rose might be good too.

66
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Every time it's valentine, all the roses are reserved weeks in advance,

67
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,720
but now you mentioned it, I’ve never given one to grandma even though I work in a flower shop.

68
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,400
Then can you do me a favor?

69
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,680
What is it? If I can help, I’m glad to.

70
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,000
Give this rose to your grandma,

71
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,320
give her a kiss and tell her it’s from me

72
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,200
and the rose is called...

73
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,560
Sunshine.

74
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,240
Thank you, thank you

75
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,400
Grandma will be so happy.

76
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,720
Get going, Happy valentine’s day.

77
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,600
She will be really happy.

78
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,080
And so it is,

79
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,480
what kind of love expires?

80
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,760
And what kind does not.

81
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,920
As for me, I’m not fortunate enough to find the kind that Jared has.

82
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,120
But at least I know love is made of many things

83
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
and not just owning someone

84
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,720
Q, thanks for everything

85
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,200
thank you for this brief time.

86
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,920
In just seven days you have made me realised my own ignorance,

87
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,520
I only think about myself but I never see who I really am.

88
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,560
I have written everything in this journal

89
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
and hope that one day…

90
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Happy Valentine’s day, Norm.

91
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,240
Happy valentine’s day, Sunshine,

92
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,680
dear me, where are you going?

93
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,040
On a vacation.

94
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,560
Oh, you scared me, I thought you’re moving out.

95
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,240
Not yet, I’m not moving anytime soon. I like it here.

96
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,440
You like it here and do you like me as well?

97
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,160
Of course, You’re weird that’s why I like you.

98
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,960
Only weird people understand other weird people.

99
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,440
Hey, that stain, you’re not getting rid of it?

100
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,480
The more I try to erase it the messier it gets, so I’m just gonna leave it.

101
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,840
But i have to be careful not to let some drunk make another stain.

102
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,560
Good, it’s a mark of history.

103
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,320
How many days are you going for?

104
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,360
A week.

105
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
Have a good time, going with your boyfriend?

106
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,280
No, going alone.

107
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,360
Going alone?

108
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
Yeah, traveling alone is the new trend.

109
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,360
You’re kidding, where did your guy go?

110
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,440
I don’t have one, we broke up.

111
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
Oh, sorry to hear that.

112
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,200
Everybody says that.

113
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,360
No one ever says glad to hear that or congratulations to your guy.

114
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,120
Come on, who says what they really mean, we just think it.

115
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
That’s why I like you.

116
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Oh, I didn't get you a valentine’s gift,

117
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
let me get back to you, i’ll find you something.

118
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,960
It doesn't have to be gifts, it can be a guy.

119
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,520
Hey sis’ if I could find one wouldn’t I keep him for myself?

120
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,520
Okay, Then I wish that you find one,

121
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
if there’s any left over send him to me.

122
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,680
Okay, deal.

123
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,640
See you Sis’

124
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,440
Travel safe, what time is your flight?

125
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,840
One pm, I’m going to get some coffee first.

126
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,560
This valentine is the first time that I can feel love all around,

127
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,000
love that is from my own heart.

128
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Hello.

129
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,360
Jared delivered your rose, yes?

130
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,280
The last one.

131
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Oh yes he did.

132
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
So what do you want?

133
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,680
Um, I just happened to pass by…

134
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
The bar is not open yet.

135
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,760
No, I didn't come to drink,

136
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,080
I just wanted to say hello.

137
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,480
Say hello…

138
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
happy valentine’s

139
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,160
Happy valentine’s

140
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,160
Do you still remember when you told me

141
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,640
Flowers get you high, alcohol makes you see the truth.

142
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,480
You believed that?

143
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
Yes,

144
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,000
I totally bought into it, it was the truth for the broken hearted.

145
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,200
And now?

146
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,080
I'm over it.

147
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,920
Alcohol is alcohol, flowers are flowers.

148
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,840
Lucky you to be over it.

149
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,760
Yeah, lucky me.

150
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,680
Say, I would like some flowers.

151
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,560
There are no more roses left.

152
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,120
Something else is okay.

153
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,640
Why?

154
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
Jared already delivered your rose.

155
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah,

156
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,440
but I gave that rose to someone

157
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,360
and I just realised that giving brings happiness,

158
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,640
so now I want the flowers to be my apology.

159
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,320
What do you have left?

160
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
Wait here.

161
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,400
White tulip, the flower of atonement.

162
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Thank you,

163
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
it’s beautiful. How much?

164
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,320
Take it.

165
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,240
I can't, why are you giving it to me?

166
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Or do you like me or something?

167
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,600
Stop playing or I'll curse you.

168
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,160
Why are you giving it to me?

169
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Didn't you just say that giving brings happiness?

170
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
Oh yeah.

171
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,000
Simple as that.

172
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
Take it.

173
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,800
Thank you so much.

174
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,680
A white tulip, the flower of atonement,

175
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,480
I just found that out.

176
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,360
Tae tae is a weird guy,

177
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,960
but deep down he’s kind like Jared said.

178
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
But why did he give me this flower?

179
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,320
But I know what I'm going to do with it.

180
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
There are some loose ends

181
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
that I need to take care of.

182
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
Let's keep practicing

183
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,560
Hello, Air.

184
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,160
You…

185
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,320
I come in peace,

186
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,640
I’m sorry about the night before.

187
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I’m here to say sorry to Rain as well.

188
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,120
I think we should just add some ala carte dishes.

189
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,720
The customers should like it.

190
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,840
Who is going to make it?

191
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,640
I am.

192
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,640
Can you handle it?

193
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
Your hands are already full with the pastries and also the new drinks.

194
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,680
I can do it.

195
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,840
I’ll train Preaw to be my assistant.

196
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,360
He seems to be interested.

197
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
He’s interested?

198
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,360
He’s over there dancing.

199
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,880
I think he would rather be a dancer than a chef.

200
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,000
But he can’t dance.

201
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,640
He’ll know when he gets older that he’s better in the kitchen.

202
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,080
Maybe not, some grown ups still don't know who they are.

203
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,040
I don’t know about that, but what I know is

204
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
I can handle it. I want to do it.

205
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,600
because I love...

206
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,280
what I do. And I want more customers to like our place.

207
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,600
Rain.

208
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Happy Valentine's day, Rain.

209
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,280
Sun…

210
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,200
Look at that, you also make that face,

211
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,000
I must have been awful to people.

212
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Rain, I’m sorry,

213
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,480
sorry for everything.

214
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,200
Sun, I told you that…

215
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Hold up,

216
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,360
don't take it the wrong way.

217
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,600
I’m not here to make trouble to get you back.

218
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
That sun is dead and gone,

219
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,280
gone with all his bad selfishness

220
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
and immaturity.

221
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,360
I came here today to apologise to the both of you.

222
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,840
Please forgive me.

223
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,320
White tulip the flower of atonement.

224
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,600
Can we still be friends?

225
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Of course, Sun.

226
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Thank you.

227
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
where are you going?

228
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
Going to see some snow,

229
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,120
the flight is at one pm, So I stopped by here first.

230
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,640
Let’s go talk over there.

231
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,200
I’m gonna go see how the kids are doing.

232
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,640
Hey, come sit with us.

233
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,720
You go ahead, the kids are waiting.

234
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
Make yourself at home, Sun.

235
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,040
You want something to drink?

236
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,040
No thanks.

237
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,280
You don't drink coffee, you want some chocolate?

238
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,600
No thanks, I’ll be leaving soon.

239
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,520
And who are you going with?

240
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,600
By myself.

241
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,640
I’m...

242
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
sorry.

243
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,800
No, don’t be. I’m really okay.

244
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Have a good time, enjoy the snow,

245
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
maybe you’ll meet some new friends along the way.

246
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,640
I’ll try.

247
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,440
You know, I’m trying to be better.

248
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,040
I will talk to more people, make more friends.

249
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,760
You never had any friends before.

250
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,880
Right, So this is the new me,

251
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,680
since I was young I was used to being alone,

252
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:24,040
so I had no real friends, not even one.

253
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,520
All I had was my imaginary friend that I made up.

254
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,200
Because you’re artistic, I get it.

255
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,720
Don't call it that, I’m still far from it.

256
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,040
It’s funny that I study theater,

257
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,760
but still I don't understand myself or others

258
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
like how I try to understand the characters I play.

259
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
Our Lives

260
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,920
take time to understand.

261
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,320
In the past seven days

262
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,720
I have learned so much,

263
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,360
you know what?

264
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,640
I just came to understand what it feels like to lose something,

265
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
you go through phases to cope,

266
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,480
denial,

267
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,720
anger,

268
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,080
dealing with it

269
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,640
and losing hope,

270
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,040
and then you accept it.

271
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,680
I’ve been through those phases.

272
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,080
It made me matured to understand things better.

273
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,440
I’m glad that you’ve matured.

274
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Air is getting good, is he a dancer?

275
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
No, he’s a law student.

276
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Sometimes we don't get to do what we love.

277
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
Under the circumstances,

278
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,840
you’re lucky to get to be what you want to be.

279
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,240
Air is also lucky to have met you.

280
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,760
That old guy…

281
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,720
That’s Air’s dad. Do you know him?

282
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,360
No,

283
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,040
but he looks familiar.

284
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,560
He comes here everyday.

285
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
His favorite drink is the Yok lor

286
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,880
Which is not on the menu.

287
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,600
That’s how you met Air, through his dad.

288
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,280
Good guess.

289
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,400
He’s sweet.

290
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,840
Yeah he is, he’s a sweet old guy.

291
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,640
Everyone, please prepare yourself.

292
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,680
Just free style, I want to know what basics everyone has.

293
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,200
Try it now. I'll count the beats for you.

294
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,840
five, six, seven, eight

295
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,360
one, two, three and four

296
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
five, six, seven, eight

297
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,320
one, two, three and four

298
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,640
five, six, seven, eight

299
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,480
Okay, just a moment.

300
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,000
Soaring into the sky, challenging the sun…

301
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,440
No matter how high you go up,

302
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,560
you will fall down.

303
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
What is it that we cannot -

304
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,200
This song…

305
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,880
Yep, it’s a hit right now.

306
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,000
Sun, why are you crying?

307
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,840
I’m... okay.

308
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,640
It’s a lot of feelings,

309
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,600
I feel overwhelmed,

310
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,880
feel guilt,

311
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,880
and shame…

312
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,800
Don’t cry, Sun

313
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,240
But I’m really happy.

314
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Happy that I can see the value in other people.

315
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,640
When you’re mature you see less of yourself.

316
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
I have to go now.

317
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Travel safe, my brother.

318
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,560
Then I was able to pay off what was on my mind.

319
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,040
Nothing is stuck anymore.

320
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,920
But if you ask, then I will become as pure and clear as a white tulip.

321
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,560
Flowers as an atonement?

322
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,440
The answer is no.

323
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Shame still scars my heart.

324
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,280
and will probably never recover

325
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,400
But I'm happy to have that scar.

326
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
The scars of experiences that will remind me

327
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,560
And always remind me to miss you...

328
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,080
Q.

329
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,560
Happy Valentine's day, Elsa.

330
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,240
Hello, are you not on your way yet?

331
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,720
I’m going to the airport.

332
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,960
So devil man, have you seen the billboards.

333
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,440
Not yet.

334
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,440
What’s the point, you can't see my face anyway.

335
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,080
Oh come on, Go take a look.

336
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,600
And hey, I’m calling to give you good news, two good news actually.

337
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,080
What is it?

338
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,760
The play you auditioned for, you got the part.

339
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,520
Really?

340
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,120
Yes, really.

341
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,840
And the second good news is the director is really pleased with you

342
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,360
so he wants you to be the lead in his new series,

343
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,480
which is right after the play, how’s that for good news.

344
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
thank you so much Elsa.

345
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,000
Q. You know,

346
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I never thought that right this minute I would miss you the most.

347
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,680
If you were with me now, You must be happy for me, right?

348
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,600
Thank you.

349
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,880
And thank you

350
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,920
to "whoever" prayed for me to come back to live in this world again.

351
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,200
Even though I'm not a hero like in the legend you told me about.

352
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,080
But being a normal person, making mistakes, being stupid,

353
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,680
has come back to have another chance.

354
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,280
By relighting the extinguished candle of my life.

355
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,080
“Whoever”

356
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,080
you know who it is

357
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,960
Excuse me.

358
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,120
No worries.

359
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,960
- Q!
- Q!

360
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,680
Please sit in your seat, Sir.

361
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,440
We traveled past each other from different planets.

362
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,760
On a cold night

363
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,400
We met again.

364
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,760
Will it be time, fate, or trepidation?

365
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,600
that brought you and me Let's be together here.

366
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,920
And when the sight Let's coordinate

367
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,040
our universe Move in and overlap.

368
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:43,920
If we embrace without knowing

369
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:50,880
What will it feel like?

370
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,320
Before we took off, what did you call me?

371
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,880
Oh, I've mistaken you

372
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,960
for someone that I used to know.

373
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,840
And you…What did you call me?

374
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,920
Q.

375
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
I called you Q

376
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,480
That’s weird, i don't know why but i called you the same thing.

377
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,040
My name is sunshine, you can call me Sun for short.

378
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,240
My name is Sky, or just Guy is okay.

379
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,040
Pleased to meet you.

380
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,320
Likewise.

381
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,400
And are you traveling alone?

382
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Yeah, I’m on my own.

383
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,000
On valentine’s?

384
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,080
Yeah,

385
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
and you?

386
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,880
I’m by myself.

387
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
On Valentine’s?

388
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,600
Then how about...

389
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,920
we enjoy this trip together?

390
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,600
On the night of two stars...

391
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,080
How many cold nights have passed since we met again?

392
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,320
May have once embraced, may have known

393
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,160
We may have been together for a long time.

394
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,200
We can let us float away

395
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,720
I want to stop this moment.

396
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,520
I don't know the night or day.

397
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,640
People will never know.

398
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,680
we thought we knew better.

399
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Question with everything in the sky

400
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,480
Assign meaning to fate

401
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,400
I used to think that I was big.

402
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,280
Thinking that the sky is far away, it's close to it.

403
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,440
Soaring into the sky, challenging the sun…

404
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,760
No matter how high you go up,

405
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,880
you will fall down.

406
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,560
What is it that we cannot see?

407
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,320
It is equally possible to live or die.

408
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,120
That cat in the box lives forever.

409
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,000
Or decay and extinguish with time

410
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,440
I used to think that I was big.

411
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,400
Thinking that the sky is far away, it's close to it.

412
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,440
Forget to look at the diversity of life.

413
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
How much do you see?

414
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,640
What do you know?

415
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
Damrong.

416
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,720
Meaning, I once set out on a journey to find meaning of life,

417
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,280
the whole universe, and death

418
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,960
What will you get? I'm Damrong, not Einstein.

419
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,480
But I never searched for the meaning of the name Damrong.

420
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,120
But I will wonder what is causing the confusion.

421
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,800
Why must there be black and then white? There must be ups and downs.

422
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,520
The more I thought about it, the more I asked, the more I realized that the more I didn't know, the more confused I became.

423
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,240
Just live with pride until the last day.

424
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,280
If we disappear

425
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:42,600
What is left?

426
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,880
People ask too many questions

427
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,040
and want to specify too much.

428
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,160
can stop asking questions,

429
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,800
but you're still thinking.

430
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,600
I used to think that I was big.

431
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,800
Thinking that the sky is far away, it's close to it.

432
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,840
Soaring into the sky, challenging the sun

433
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,160
No matter how high you go up,

434
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,520
The universe is so vast

435
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,160
There's so much more.

436
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,240
Too much to learn, too many words to explain

437
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,760
If you don't know, you will live and live.
