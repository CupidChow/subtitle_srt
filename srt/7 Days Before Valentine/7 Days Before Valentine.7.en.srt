1
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,157
How are you doing, sunshine?

2
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,117
Today everything seems to

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,536
Shit, this is insane!

4
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,331
Have you thought of who you are erasing tonight?

5
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,792
Meen, his close friend.

6
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:24,959
So cruel

7
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:29,339
if I can't go back then I'm going to erase,
erase everything in this darn world.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,511
Rain, the owner of Rainmaker. Is he here?

9
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,639
No, because there's no such person

10
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,935
There's me - Krod, the owner of Acid rain

11
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,782
The place looks kinda cool with this new design huh?

12
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,867
What would you like?

13
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,285
Iced americano please.

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,123
Are you new here? I don't recognise you.

15
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,752
Don't forget, It's not the same world anymore.

16
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,047
I've been working here for a while,

17
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,718
Our promotion today is

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,556
couples who order two of our signature drink

19
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,853
will get a coupon for a free drink, it's available only on valentines day

20
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,230
But I already ordered

21
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,065
And we're not a couple.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,401
And where's rain?

23
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,487
Rain? Who is Rain?

24
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,448
Preaw, You seen Rain?

25
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,452
Who's Rain, and how do you know my name?

26
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,791
Are you playing tricks on me?

27
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,917
Focus

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,300
Rain, the owner of Rainmaker. Is he here?

29
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,096
No, because there's no such person

30
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,267
There's me - Krod, the owner of Acid rain

31
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,302
Here, have some. To cool your temper…

32
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,182
You're not thirsty?

33
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,311
Come on - I changed it to the signature drink,

34
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,438
to get the free coupon for valentines

35
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,944
You've gone too far!

36
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,622
Don't break that, you don't have money To buy a new one.

37
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,507
Let me borrow your phone, I want to know where Rain is.

38
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,925
I don't have a phone.

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,764
Where are you going? you have an audition later.

40
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,490
Haven't you learned anything?

41
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,450
You can't resolve anything by using your temper.

42
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,453
This is another world caused by your choosing

43
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,330
and It didn't turn out like you expected.

44
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,332
You still have three More nights, remember?

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,418
Let me tell you something, Q

46
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,045
I'm beginning to have serious doubts about you

47
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,047
everytime when you say you're this cupid reaper guy.

48
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,176
What I believe is that you're inhuman,

49
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,764
what the hell are you? Why did you choose me? What do you want?

50
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,891
why did they send you for?

51
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,520
If you are cupid,

52
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,564
where's your wings? Where's your bow?

53
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,066
You're just tricking me to erase people.

54
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,402
You tricked me into killing people.

55
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,907
You're a devil , everything about you is just evil.

56
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,745
Let go! I hate you!

57
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,984
Nat

58
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,528
You're…

59
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,949
Do we know each other?

60
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,576
Yes we do,

61
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,457
Well we used to know each other

62
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:20,171
I went to find Rain at the Rainmaker but now It's called Acid Rain.

63
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,344
The Rainmaker closed down five years ago.

64
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,564
So, do you know where Rain is?

65
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,676
When I first saw you. I felt like we've met

66
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,178
But I have no idea where.

67
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,099
Doesn't matter, we've probably met somewhere

68
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,560
Maybe at the Rainmaker.

69
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,605
Rainmaker.

70
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,276
I love that place.

71
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,070
But it went through many owners

72
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,949
It's now Acid rain, owned by that guy.

73
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,326
Doesn't quite feel the same though, does it?

74
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,374
And what about Rain

75
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,502
Rain…

76
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,255
he...

77
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,801
quit.

78
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,805
And do you know where he is?

79
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,683
What are you to Rain?

80
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm his -

81
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,769
Friends, they're friends

82
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,781
Rain...

83
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,911
is no longer here

84
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,917
What do you mean?

85
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,004
Rain opened the place for just a year

86
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,839
And then he…

87
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:30,885
died.

88
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,723
WHAT?

89
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,354
You're not from around here, so you might not have heard.

90
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,192
He didn't like the world he was living in,

91
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,236
so...

92
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,489
chose not to live in it anymore.

93
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,782
WHY?

94
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,827
It was sad for all of us.

95
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,622
But it was his decision.

96
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,502
Why??

97
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,731
Your friend must really care for Rain.

98
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,318
Same for me.

99
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,497
Harder,

100
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,376
put your back into it.

101
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
Hey, Sunshine, I have something to -

102
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,341
What's the matter?

103
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,218
Hey Q.

104
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,431
What's going with men nowadays,

105
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,933
chasing each other around like a Bollywood movie.

106
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,024
Scrubb! Keep at it.

107
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,254
I know...

108
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,673
I suck,

109
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,259
I have nothing to offer,

110
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,263
but did you have to do me like this?

111
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,143
Why did you do this to someone I love,

112
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,187
I messed up.

113
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,064
But did I deserve this?

114
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,069
Rain didn't do anything

115
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,750
Have some soup,

116
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,962
It's past noon. You're not hungry?

117
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,715
Try it.

118
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,845
Corn soup, nice and warm, I added a touch of milk.

119
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,988
Do you remember

120
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,783
when I told you about loss

121
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,537
and how painful it is.

122
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,042
I promise you,

123
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,169
I don't want you to go through what I did.

124
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,798
There's no reason I would want  to hurt you.

125
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,848
You can believe me or not,

126
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,350
I didn't think that the last wish

127
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,731
would turn out like this.

128
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,160
Once a physician believed that

129
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,580
if we knew the location and speed of all the molecules in the universe

130
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,498
and apply the right calculation.

131
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,668
We can see into our past and future.

132
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,549
But now I realize that's not true.

133
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,137
Certainty is knowing that everything is uncertain.

134
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,641
Damrong may just know more than Einstein.

135
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,230
Who's Damrong?

136
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,861
I'm glad you're speaking to me.

137
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,751
Yeah, Damrong. The musician we met yesterday.

138
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,172
It's a shame that the world yesterday is not suited for him

139
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,676
People will never know.

140
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:20,140
we thought we knew better.

141
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,437
Question with everything in the sky

142
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,859
Assign meaning to fate

143
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:36,406
That person is so big.

144
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,120
To see what's around it

145
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,625
oaring into the sky, challenging the sun

146
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:53,507
No matter how high you go up, you will fall down.

147
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,260
But you saw that he didn't give up.

148
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,431
Humans tries to give answers reasons and logic to a universe that has no reason,

149
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,935
We want to able to see into the future,

150
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,565
But we only see ourselves,

151
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,318
our ego blinds us

152
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,281
and we are never here

153
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,160
in the present

154
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,831
Because we only see ourselves

155
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,295
When we realize, it's already too late

156
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,681
Or maybe...

157
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,185
we will never know

158
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,909
But you still have a chance

159
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:10,334
Chances that we wish we have when we've used it all

160
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,924
Chances that we squander

161
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,638
because we take it for granted.

162
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,550
Yes Elsa,

163
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,930
my battery died,

164
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,227
No..I'm okay.

165
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,358
Yes,

166
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,111
I haven't forgot.

167
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,935
Are you just going to let time go by without making use of it?

168
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,440
Now that he's no longer here,

169
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,610
life means nothing

170
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,030
I know,

171
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,782
I keep telling you to live in the now.

172
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,037
This is the now.

173
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:17,627
The present becomes the past and the present keeps manifesting,

174
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:23,925
You only see yourself, you think that things go on forever,

175
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,261
nothing is forever,

176
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,557
you were sad just now then the phone rang and interrupted that moment,

177
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,434
which might be a new opportunity

178
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,021
but you chose to wallow here

179
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,942
because you think that your grief is forever.

180
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,655
Can you at least tell me,

181
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,951
how things turned out like this?

182
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,664
I think you can put two and two together.

183
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,046
Rain killed himself before he met me.

184
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,425
Can you guess why?

185
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,098
Because Meen does not exist.

186
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,558
You never considered that.

187
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,271
I hate myself.

188
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,401
Don't blame yourself,

189
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,529
we're both just as guilty.

190
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,951
Why didn't I see this coming?

191
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:37,624
Happy birthday to you.

192
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,464
That's it.

193
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,301
What is this thing?

194
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,512
What this?

195
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,930
you should try it first.

196
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,981
I never saw it coming at all…

197
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,987
Thank you so much my dear, thanks for everything

198
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,698
It's the best birthday,

199
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,034
I thank that you are here on this earth as my friend.

200
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,787
Thank you

201
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,416
for giving me the chance to celebrate all your birthdays with you and so on.

202
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,423
You sure you don't want me to take you?

203
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,926
The car is here, you hang out with Sunshine.

204
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,304
Call me when you get home.

205
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,055
see you.

206
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,974
Bye Sunshine.

207
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,476
See you, Meen.

208
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,936
Take good care of Rain please.

209
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,272
You got it.

210
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,628
Meen loves you a lot.

211
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,505
Yes,

212
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,423
she loves me the most,

213
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,634
we really love each other.

214
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,889
I can feel that, sometimes it feels like I'm not needed.

215
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,934
Hey, Don't say that.

216
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,229
Wait, are you jealous of her?

217
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,023
Oh no, why would I be?

218
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,277
But don't you have any friends?

219
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,196
No

220
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,990
I'm fortunate to have Meen,

221
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,703
if I didn't Maybe I wouldn't be standing here.

222
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:46,962
Rain

223
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,008
What I said to Meen earlier…

224
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,385
What did you say?

225
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,637
Well...

226
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,266
she said take good care of you

227
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,475
And…

228
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:07,315
I told her I would and I really meant what I said, Okay?

229
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,568
Thanks.

230
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,405
Rain…

231
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,031
What now??

232
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,536
I get that Meen loves you a whole lot.

233
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,414
But apart from Meen

234
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,543
Can I also love you as well?

235
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,004
No you can't.

236
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,839
Why not?

237
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,759
We're just friends, friends can't love each other like that.

238
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,141
Unless we change our status.

239
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,338
I get it,

240
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,965
If Meen doesn't exist,

241
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,178
Rain has no one to console him to give him support after breaking up with Mek

242
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,722
you already got a new friend.

243
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,391
Hey Meen, this is…

244
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,642
Sunshine.

245
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,353
Nice to meet you, sunshine.

246
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,191
And Mek leaving Rain wasn't because he found someone else

247
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,361
but he had to make sacrifices.

248
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,905
We won't accept it.

249
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,408
I...

250
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,909
have someone else.

251
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,579
And what hurt Rain the most,

252
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,541
wasn't just breaking up with Mek

253
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,711
but what happened to Mek after…

254
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,408
Nice to meet you, sunshine.

255
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,620
I have someone else.

256
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,318
Behold my hand,

257
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,237
it's color matches yours

258
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,281
The color of sin,

259
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,160
my hand is tainted

260
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,997
Water, where's the water

261
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,209
Just a splash may make this hand anew

262
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,881
Be gone! be gone! Be gone!

263
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,676
It does not come off

264
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,179
The sin remains

265
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,808
Erase it! Erase it! Be gone with it

266
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,312
Don't fall weak

267
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,568
Hide the hand from prying eyes

268
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,279
But even so, it matters not

269
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,283
A warrior's hand like yours is familiar to  blood

270
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,911
It is time

271
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,079
Rise!

272
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,331
Onwards we go

273
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,294
Hands withheld, head high smile , be brave And onwards we go

274
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,762
Okay, thank you, We'll consider and someone will call you.

275
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,681
Thank you.

276
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,141
Looking forward to your guidance. I really want to work with you.

277
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,604
Okay, the team will be in touch.

278
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,946
Not bad.

279
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,407
Her name is Maxima, right?

280
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,202
For the part of Lady Macbeth, I think she could do it.

281
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,954
Give her a call back.

282
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,622
Okay, I'll take care of it for you.

283
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,833
And for the male role...

284
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:22,547
is this all we have, are there more? We still haven't found our Macbeth.

285
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,340
I want you to see another actor

286
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,717
- Where?
- I've told him to come

287
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,217
Where is he?

288
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,554
But I have no idea where he is.

289
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,557
Well it's theatre you know,

290
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,269
tiring work, young people these days aren't interested,

291
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,856
no fame in doing it, not like those Y series.

292
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,566
Y series...

293
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,526
He should come soon.

294
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,861
Is that him?

295
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,654
Yes.

296
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,240
You don't have to look at just his -

297
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,993
Speak of the devil.

298
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,000
Come on in Sunshine.

299
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,378
Are you ready?

300
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:14,682
Say hello he's a big name director,

301
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,519
You told me you studied theatre

302
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,272
So I called you in.

303
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,524
Director, this is Sun.

304
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,905
he also did theatre so perhapsthis could be a senior, junior type thing.

305
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,367
Well, I think our age is way far apart for that.

306
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,704
Hope you're well,

307
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,499
coming to an audition why do you look so lifeless

308
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,211
Maybe he forgot his soul at home.

309
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,129
Oh,

310
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,174
so...

311
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,428
do you know what we're looking for?

312
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,305
Here, try this.

313
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,189
You want me to read?

314
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,526
Well, do you need to rehearse first?

315
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,696
Just do a cold reading,

316
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:10,989
Go ahead.

317
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,787
You can do it.

318
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,039
Good luck.

319
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,548
Give him a chance.

320
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,082
It has been done,

321
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,044
It has been done

322
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,714
Death is more quiet than I thought

323
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,802
Not even…

324
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,146
I'm sorry

325
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,273
Can I start again?

326
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,150
yes.

327
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,509
It has been done

328
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,513
It has been done

329
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,227
Death is more quiet than I thought

330
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,730
Not a sound to be heard

331
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,151
Not even…

332
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,287
Okay let's try this,

333
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,414
Elsa.

334
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,582
Yes.

335
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,960
The woman who came just now, Maxim Maxima?

336
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:29,585
Maxima.

337
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,754
Has she gone back yet? Go follow her.

338
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,672
call her back

339
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,132
Okay.

340
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,647
Weakling.

341
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,526
Weakling. I'd never thought a warrior like you can be so weak hearted

342
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,320
If it was me,

343
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,490
even if a newborn child was sleeping blissfully in the bosoms of it's mother

344
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,409
I would snatch it and end it's breath

345
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,787
If that child was to come between my destiny

346
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,374
Power, status, do you no longer desire such things?

347
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,836
Give me the dagger

348
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,798
It has been done,

349
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,094
It has been done

350
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,641
Death is more quiet than I thought

351
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,936
Not a sound to be heard

352
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,023
Not even a plea for mercy

353
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,737
Behold!

354
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,490
Behold, my hand

355
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,742
my tainted hand of sin

356
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,871
that cannot be ridden.

357
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,415
Behold my hand,

358
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,836
the color matches yours the shade of sin,

359
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,547
our hands tainted in sin.

360
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,424
It cannot be erased,

361
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,052
this sin cannot be erased.

362
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,513
Water, where's the water

363
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,933
Just a splash may make this hand anew

364
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,812
Be gone! be gone! Be gone!

365
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,441
It does not come off

366
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,361
The stain won't come off

367
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,740
Erase it, erase it Be rid of it all

368
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,577
Don't be weak

369
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,333
It won't come off

370
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,379
No water can rid this

371
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,674
All the water from the ocean will not rid it because it has been done

372
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,927
What I did can never be undone

373
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,141
No, there is hope,

374
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,852
tonight

375
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,938
if not tonight then the next, And the next

376
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,150
For me to undo my wrongs, I can still make it right.

377
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,156
And rid this mark of sin,

378
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:52,371
be gone! Be gone!

379
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,294
I've wronged, I've wronged the more I try

380
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,589
The worse it gets

381
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,925
I don't know what to do

382
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,138
Helpless, I am completely helpless.

383
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,422
He's very good.

384
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,970
Very good, even though it's a bit off script.

385
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,179
You okay?

386
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,297
Where are you going?

387
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,762
I don't know.

388
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,521
Let's go home,

389
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,565
I'll take you home.

390
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,985
Snap out of it,

391
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,488
I'm worried about you.

392
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,743
Cupid Reaper,

393
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,915
Can you let go?

394
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,586
I want to be alone.

395
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,256
I don't want you to be by yourself.

396
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,842
You're worried I'll do something?

397
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,556
I know what you're going through.

398
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,183
I'm worried about you

399
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,811
Really worried about you.

400
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,273
Remember that tonight you still have another chance…

401
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,401
really worried about you.

402
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,863
I don't want to mess up again.

403
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,234
Have you decided who you're going to erase tonight?

404
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,361
I don't want to do it anymore.

405
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,196
You have to go through with it.

406
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,823
I'm scared.

407
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,743
It's the only way to bring Rain back.

408
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,535
If tomorrow…

409
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,329
Shut up and just make your wish!

410
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,831
I wish...

411
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,209
that who ever is the reason for Rain not returning to me

412
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,630
would vanish from this universe
