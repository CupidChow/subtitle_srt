(Woori the Virgin)

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,750
What's this?

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,289
Throw it out.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,930
Then this list will make us money.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,859
You keep the list with you.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,430
Give the necklace to someone.

14
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,329
Oh Woo Ri?

15
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,570
How are the scripts coming along?

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,399
They are great.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,880
Gosh. This is a set.

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,350
Goodness.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,789
I put the necklace in her bag.

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,130
- No one saw you, right? - No.

21
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,099
You're sure nothing will happen to her, right?

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,869
Like what?

23
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,070
They'll scare her a bit and take the necklace from her.

24
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,970
Go to the hospital...

25
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,809
and spread the word Oh Woo Ri has the necklace,

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,009
so Chairman Kim knows.

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,410
Okay.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,609
I should mention it here and there, so it won't look obvious. Right?

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,979
You don't have time for that.

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,949
Do it in one go.

31
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:47,618
- Hello. - Hello.

32
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,059
- Hello. - Hello.

33
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:53,430
You guys are working so hard, so I brought some coffee for you.

34
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:55,960
Thank you for the coffee.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,868
How are things going? Do you need any help?

36
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,240
What? No.

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,470
Please have some coffee.

38
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,819
Oh, no. My necklace.

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,349
What about your necklace?

40
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,950
My necklace is gone.

41
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,159
I must have left it in the writer's studio.

42
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,689
I left it in the assistant's seat. So she must've taken it. Right?

43
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,559
The assistant writer?

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,899
I'm sorry. I don't follow you.

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,229
You know, her name is Oh Woo Ri.

46
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,999
I'm sure the assistant writer took it.

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,838
It was a present to me.

48
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,598
An artisan handmade the necklace.

49
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,439
He told me not to lose it, but I forgot it there.

50
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,640
I should get it from her later.

51
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,379
From Assistant Writer Oh Woo Ri.

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,149
Hello.

53
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,088
Were you trying to broadcast your chitchat?

54
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,689
I'm sorry. When did this happen?

55
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,990
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,300
Guys, let's go home now.

57
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,430
If you keep staring at it, your eyes will get bad.

58
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,899
You already checked everything before.

59
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,068
If Na Hee is right and there is a list,

60
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,670
where would that be?

61
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,510
The list of card transactions.

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,610
I'm reviewing every single document.

63
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:21,619
What? A necklace workshop?

64
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,378
What do people do here?

65
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,390
Hey. I went to one with my girlfriend.

66
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,959
You can pay and make a necklace you want.

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,658
Right. There are a lot of handicraft workshops these days.

68
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,730
Hold on.

69
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:36,260
You will be able to make the necklace however you want.

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,830
Right.

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,240
- What's this? - Your necklace.

72
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,809
You submitted it as evidence before. And I'm returning it to you.

73
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,369
Gosh. The one who gave it to me is dead now.

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,278
No Man Chul gave this to you?

75
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,779
He gave it to me and nagged me to wear it every day.

76
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,149
He was so sensitive when I didn't wear it.

77
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,579
- Darn it. - Where are you going?

78
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,319
- Where are you going? - Kang Jae!

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,420
Sir, do you remember this necklace?

80
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:03,990
I remember this.

81
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,029
A client custom-ordered this necklace.

82
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:09,729
He asked me to make a small gap in the necklace,

83
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,059
so he could insert a memory card.

84
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,140
I'm sure there's a list that shows their before and after photos.

85
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,009
- Thank you. - Sure.

86
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,280
(Lee Ma Ri, Team Leader at Diamond)

87
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,939
Mom.

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,970
Mom!

89
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,709
Mom!

90
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,309
Mom!

91

Mom.

92

Mom!

93

Mom!

94
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:08,119
Mom. Are you all right?

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,590
What did you say?

96
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,400
Okay. I got you.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,409
- Why didn't you answer your phone? - How did you find me here?

98
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,069
Where's the necklace from No Man Chul?

99
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,240
- I don't know! - I must find it.

100
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,850
It's not here!

101
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,619
Where is it then?

102
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,249
Oh Woo Ri has it!

103
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,689
Where's the necklace?

104
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,019
What necklace?

105
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,790
Grandma!

106
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,139
Woo Ri!

107
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,110
I'm a cop.

108
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,480
- Grandma. - Police.

109
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,650
Drop your knife

110
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,230
Please don't hurt my grandmother.

111
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,100
Chairman Kim?

112
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:37,100
Please don't hurt my grandmother.

113
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,110
Don't move. Drop it.

114
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,290
Kang Jae!

115
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,160
Mom.

116
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,170
Fine.

117
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,400
Please let her go.

118
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,990
Grandma!

119
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,290
Grandma!

120
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,490
Grandma.

121
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,959
Grandma.

122
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,670
Oh, no. Grandma.

123
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,550
(Sungho Hospital)

124
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,260
Ma'am.

125
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:22,709
Mom.

126
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,319
She has no external injuries.

127
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,390
They did a CT scan and examined her.

128
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,289
She had a concussion,

129
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,958
but due to her age, her vitals are a bit shaky.

130
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,290
When will she wake up?

131
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,000
She might wake up tomorrow or in a few days.

132
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,069
But they can't guarantee anything.

133
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,099
But she will wake up, right?

134
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,469
She will.

135
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,238
They have to examine her brain...

136
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,410
once she wakes up to know if her brain had been damaged.

137
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,150
Okay.

138
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,420
You guys went through a lot without me.

139
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,449
Are you all right, Woo Ri?

140
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,589
Are you hurt? Should we get you a doctor?

141
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,959
No.

142
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,290
I'm fine.

143
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,099
She's hurt because of me.

145
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,430
Why is this your fault?

146
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,270
Had I gotten there sooner...

147
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,569
No.

148
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:25,209
I couldn't have done anything without Kang Jae. I was so scared.

149
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,140
Thank you, Kang Jae.

150
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,050
I have to go back to the scene.

151
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,620
Okay.

152
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,319
Thank you. You should get going.

153
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,030
Hey.

154
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,160
Woo Ri.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,229
You must have been scared.

156
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,069
I'll catch the culprit.

157
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,609
He took the necklace.

158
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:00,969
He was looking for the necklace.

159
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,780
I had a necklace I didn't even know I had.

160
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,550
How did he know?

161
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,979
And his voice sounded like it was altered through a machine.

162
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,689
I'll look into it.

163
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,949
It...

164
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:15,489
reminded me...

165
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,819
of a cold snake.

166
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll take care of this right away.

167
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,930
Until then,

168
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,870
you must be careful and don't be alone. Okay?

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay.

170
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:29,839
I'll get going now.

171
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,140
Call me if there's anything.

172
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,609
Kang Jae.

173
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,979
Thank you.

174
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:51,089
- There's Kang Jae. - That's Detective Lee.

175
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,359
So Chairman Kim was here?

176
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:55,660
What makes you think so?

177
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,099
The scalpel.

178
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:00,130
Chairman Kim took No Man Chul's necklace.

179
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:03,339
I'm sure the plastic surgery list of criminals was in the necklace.

180
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:05,139
Any evidence?

181
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,239
He's about 175cm tall.

182
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,680
And his build...

183
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,680
His shoulders were broad. And that's pretty much it.

184
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,949
It was dark, and he was covered up. He wore gloves too.

185
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,549
We found out his shoe size is 270mm from the footprints.

186
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,120
And that's everything the forensic team found.

187
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,989
Not even a fingerprint or a strand of hair.

188
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,260
This will be tough.

189
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:28,559
Gosh. This guy is meticulous.

190
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,270
Chairman Kim broke into Woo Ri's house.

191
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,410
But I lost him right in front of me.

192
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,370
I'll do whatever it takes...

193
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,540
to find him.

194
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:57,989
Just pack the necessities.

195
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,729
We'll be away for a few days.

196
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,459
You think Park Du Pal won't come back after a few days?

197
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,199
How did he get out of the chains?

198
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,339
If he wanted to harm us, he would have done it by now.

199
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,010
Considering everything he's done, he can't come after us.

200
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,108
Mom.

201
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:20,009
Weren't you scared when you were taped up like that?

202
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,979
Why would I be scared?

203
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,749
He'd better not show up.

204
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,589
I'm going to...

205
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,160
That startled me.

206
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,959
What are you doing here at this early hour?

207
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,400
The necklace.

208
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,800
Why did Woo Ri have that?

209
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,670
Do you know what's inside the necklace?

210
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,379
Something is inside the necklace?

211
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,680
Why did Woo Ri have that?

212
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,949
Did you give it to her on purpose?

213
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,489
Why would I give that to her?

214
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,558
I was carrying it because I didn't want to wear it.

215
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,419
But I remembered that I left it in her seat...

216
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,030
when I went there for a meeting.

217
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,290
Is that a crime?

218
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,059
You really...

219
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,170
don't know anything about the necklace?

220
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,598
I told you.

221
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,739
I didn't like it because No Man Chul gave it to me.

222
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,609
Did something happen?

223
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,079
Someone was after the necklace.

224
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,550
Who?

225
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,880
We're investigating, so we'll find out.

226
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,829
You should go home. You need to go to work.

227
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:49,499
I'm not going to work.

228
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,099
I'll stay by her side.

229
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,109
Then go home and change your clothes.

230
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,239
Let's take turns.

231
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,339
I can't go.

232
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,479
I want to stay with her.

233
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,979
Woo Ri. Go and come back.

234
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,089
Go and bring me some clothes too.

235
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,790
You should bring back what you need as well.

236
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,229
The rosary.

237
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:16,759
The rosary?

238
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,260
We need her rosary.

239
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:21,799
She prayed with the rosary for important occasions.

240
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,098
And her prayers were answered.

241
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,510
The rosary she had ever since I was a kid.

242
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,069
I'll be back, Mom.

243
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,680
(Funeral Hall, Basement 2)

244
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,670
Hello?

245
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,430
Woo Ri. Did you go to work?

246
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,969
Raphael.

247
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,609
Woo Ri. What's wrong?

248
00:15:58,839 --> 00:15:59,969
Is something wrong?

249
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,309
My grandma is unconscious.

250
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,140
What?

251
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,609
Sir.

252
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,779
The buyers from China have arrived early.

253
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,380
Something urgent came up. I'll be back soon.

254
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,520
What came up?

255
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,650
What's more urgent than our guests from China?

256
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,729
Sir, I'm really sorry. But I'm in a hurry.

257
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:25,930
I need to get there fast.

258
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,170
I wish I could help you too.

259
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:31,040
But it's not like I can fly. This is too bad.

260
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,809
What?

261
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,319
Why didn't you tell me about this?

262
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,719
I'm a teacher too. A teacher at a singing school.

263
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,089
So I'll be the perfect teacher of the day.

264
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,089
What will you teach us?

265
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,719
Singing.

266
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,358
Trot.

267
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,729
Mom. Please.

268
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,469
Woo Ri. What's wrong?

269
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,069
Is something wrong?

270
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,599
Nothing, Grandma.

271
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,010
I should pray too.

272
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,509
Do you want to borrow my rosary?

273
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,979
I have one too.

274
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,238
Woo Ri,

275
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,310
this rosary is special.

276
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,680
All the prayers are answered when you pray with this rosary.

277
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,289
I save it only for important occasions.

278
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,019
- Really? - Yes.

279
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,829
A long time ago when I was young,

280
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,758
at my first Communion,

281
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,228
my mother...

282
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,660
So your great-grandmother gave this to me.

283
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,870
From mother to mother.

284
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,799
It's been in our family for generations.

285
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,709
It seems like you have something on your mind.

286
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,870
I'll let you borrow it this once.

287
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,279
What do I do?

288
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,189
I didn't tell her about the teacher of the day event.

289
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,889
I can't tell her because if I do,

290
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,590
I'm going to hurt her feelings.

291
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:04,529
I don't want her to act silly at school.

292
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,170
I think I'm going to be...

293
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,469
really embarrassed by my mom.

294
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,219
Where is it?

295
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,199
(Teacher of the Day Program)

296
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,840
Here is your sauce.

297
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,340
- Thank you. - Eat a lot.

298
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,938
Let me know if you need more.

299
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,309
Woo Ri, your mom is the best!

300
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,579
This is so good!

301
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,320
Woo Ri, your mom is so pretty. She looks like a celebrity.

302
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,689
Here.

303
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,390
Here's your rosary.

304
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,160
Okay. Did you pray with it?

305
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,699
Was your prayer answered?

306
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,160
Yes.

307
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,900
This rosary is the best.

308
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:14,129
Woo Ri.

309
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,140
Do ask me again.

310
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,109
When there's a prayer you want to be answered,

311
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,439
ask me if you can borrow my rosary again.

312
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,939
And then pray. Okay?

313
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,650
Grandma.

314
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,420
Woo Ri.

315
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:21,769
Dry skin, combination skin, oily skin,

316
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,409
triple care, tone-up care, whitening care, and anti-ageing.

317
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,840
In total, we have seven types in our skincare line.

318
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,279
Now, we'll take a look at the details in order.

319
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,709
Chairman Kim went into Woo Ri's house.

320
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,350
He was looking for a necklace.

321
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,278
He even altered his voice.

322
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,090
Altering his voice means that he's someone we were in contact with.

323
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,488
We need to check yesterday's alibis of the Diamond Foundation people.

324
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:47,430
We can't poke around the hospital without proper evidence.

325
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,228
We won't even be issued a search warrant.

326
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:51,929
You're not in the right mind because Woo Ri's house was robbed.

327
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,669
Let's calm down and respond.

328
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,198
Captain, Woo Ri's grandmother is hurt. How can I calm down?

329
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,340
Kang Jae.

330
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,039
I'll be going to a Patrol Division next year.

331
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,879
While I was working in the Violent Crimes division,

332
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,310
five got hurt badly and one died.

333
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,380
You are not in your right mind right now.

334
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,580
Big accidents happen in such a time.

335
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,719
People should no longer get hurt.

336
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,620
Get a hold of yourself first.

337
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,039
- Mom! - What is it?

338
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:31,670
You said we should take turns sleeping.

339
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,839
I dozed off.

340
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,849
Are you seriously sleepy in this situation?

341
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,580
Darn it.

342
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:45,149
He won't come here.

343
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,688
How would Park Du Pal know we are here?

344
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,820
You are the one who suggested the night watch.

345
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,589
I'd rather go home than do the night watch.

346
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,689
Wait!

347
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,459
Can't we just let everything go?

348
00:21:56,699 --> 00:22:00,100
What if we get hurt or something?

349
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:04,439
I heard that he started to look for the necklace.

350
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,840
What if something really happens?

351
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,048
Mal Ja, that list in the necklace...

352
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,679
is definitely worth something.

353
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,880
Otherwise, they wouldn't have moved so fast to look for it.

354
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,660
We still need to wait. Okay?

355
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:40,870
(Device has been connected.)

356
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,679
I have the list that you want.

357
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,919
Don't even think about hurting me like No Man Chul.

358
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,018
If something happens to me,

359
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:55,689
the list will automatically be delivered to the police.

360
00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:58,930
If you want it, make a payment.

361
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,630
You have a new message.

362
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,839
(You said this would be over when you got the list.)

363
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,538
(You said no one would get hurt. What's going on?)

364
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,979
(Reply back quickly before I put you away.)

365
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,109
(If I get caught, you'll be done for as well.)

366
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,708
(Just listen to me until the job is done.)

367
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,120
(Message sent.)

368
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,420
- Your son is here. - Okay.

369
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,729
What brings you all the way here?

370
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,958
I can't get a hold of Eun Ran since the morning.

371
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,299
I'm getting a little worried.

372
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,469
Is Ms. Seo Gwi Nyeo here?

373
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:43,239
I can't get a hold of her either.

374
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,979
(Eun Ran)

375
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,660
Stop making me cry...

376
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,729
and wake up.

377
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,689
Mom,

378
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,600
the last thing I said to you was...

379
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,969
When we were fighting over Hyung Sik,

380
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:22,269
I told you I didn't want to be your daughter.

381
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,549
If you don't wake up like this,

382
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,850
I will hate you forever.

383
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,449
I'll be the daughter...

384
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,560
that was spiteful to her mother because of a man.

385
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,539
Hello? Eun Ran.

386
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,310
Duk Chil.

387
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:57,239
Why? What's wrong?

388
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,479
Mom collapsed.

389
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,478
She won't wake up.

390
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,880
What? Mother is ill?

391
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,619
What do I do if she doesn't wake up?

392
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,989
What are you saying? She'll wake up.

393
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,420
Which hospital is she at?

394
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:14,590
I'm sorry, but I have a full schedule today.

395
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,998
It's okay. You are busy.

396
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:20,269
I'll call you back later. You take care of her.

397
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,739
You can't be weak. All right?

398
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,670
Okay.

399
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,649
Please take care of the rest.

400
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,719
- Where are you going? - Something urgent came up.

401
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,718
What urgent thing?

402
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:43,619
We need to show our guests around the hospital and have dinner.

403
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,660
- Right? - Okay.

404
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,998
I'm sorry Woo Ri, I just left. Are you at the hospital?

405
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,899
I'm on my way to the hospital with a few things from home.

406
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,569
All right. I'll go and pick you up.

407
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,209
No, it's okay. I think I'll get there faster if I take the taxi.

408
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,310
Okay, then. I'll see you at the hospital.

409
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,789
- Woo Ri. - Kang Jae.

410
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,729
Isn't that the rosary that you borrowed from your grandmother...

411
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,969
every time something came up because it answers your prayers?

412
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:29,299
Yes, it is.

413
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,070
Your grandmother will really like that.

414
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,880
What made you come back?

415
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:39,249
I heard from Mother. I told you not to stay alone.

416
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,209
You must be really busy.

417
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,479
I feel bad about it.

418
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,449
It's okay.

419
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:51,660
Even if it's not for you, Grandmother did so much for me.

420
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,259
Her soy sauce braised beef was so good.

421
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,959
It'll be difficult to taste it from now on.

422
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,528
What? What do you mean by that?

423
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,170
Why are you saying such a thing?

424
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,140
I don't mean that.

425
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,140
I mean since we broke up.

426
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,009
Right.

427
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,149
Right, last year...

428
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,320
Last winter when I was on a stakeout for a few days,

429
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,949
Grandmother came over with a packed meal.

430
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,060
It was so good, I still remember it.

431
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,590
Soy sauce braised beef and quail eggs were the best.

432
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,130
It must have been her sincerity, right?

433
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,958
You know it takes a long time to make it.

434
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,028
It's difficult to peel the shells of each quail egg.

435
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,370
She uses the peeled ones.

436
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:42,039
Right.

437
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,008
Woo Ri, don't worry about it too much.

438
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:49,580
She'll wake up soon.

439
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,620
She's one of the strongest people I know.

440
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:54,320
That's right.

441
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:57,560
She'll wake up soon.

442
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,749
Grandma, your rosary...

443
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,748
It's just a rosary.

444
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,120
She collapsed because of me.

445
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,759
- Stop saying ridiculous things. - Grandma...

446
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:37,100
Grandma.

447
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,369
What's happening? What's wrong?

448
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,969
We'll tell you after we treat her. Please step outside.

449
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,439
Quick.

450
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,199
Woo Ri, drink something warm.

451
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,729
I'm sorry I'm late.

452
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,229
Woo Ri,

453
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:17,499
don't worry anymore.

454
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,299
I'm here now.

455
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,079
They said her vitals were off a little,

456
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,879
but they came back to normal quickly.

457
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,589
So you don't have to worry too much.

458
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,360
Why won't the doctors explain things clearly?

459
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,959
Emergency rooms are a bit like that.

460
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,560
They must have been busy, and things must've been hectic.

461
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,698
They said they didn't have any rooms and told us to wait in the ER.

462
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:50,699
But they moved us here.

463
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,769
It turns out that I had some people I knew at the hospital.

464
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,330
So I asked them for a favour.

465
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,840
They'll take care of her more from now on.

466
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,670
Thank you.

467
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,969
No, it's nothing.

468
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,439
I should've come earlier.

469
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:04,779
Mr. Choi.

470
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,508
Didn't you say you have work? How did you make it here?

471
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,019
I cleared up my schedule. How is she?

472
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:17,719
She'll wake up soon. You can stop crying now.

473
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,930
Only think good thoughts from now on.

474
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,570
Detective.

475
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:34,239
I heard you missed the culprit at the scene.

476
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,779
I told you there was a criminal hiding in your hospital, didn't I?

477
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,880
- Yes. - That guy broke into Woo Ri's home.

478
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:45,149
Who is that man?

479
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,390
I'm looking for him.

480
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,850
I'm going to catch him.

481
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,090
I'm never going to let this happen...

482
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,259
to Woo Ri and her family.

483
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,330
I'll take care...

484
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,130
of Woo Ri.

485
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:15,979
This happened because of the culprit hiding in your hospital.

486
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,150
Two people died...

487
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,519
and I ran around to solve this.

488
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,959
But you were only concerned about the Foundation's image.

489
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:48,610
Hello? Hi. How are you?

490
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,120
It's been a long time.

491
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,679
Well...

492
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,489
didn't you say you had a person who caught an industrial spy?

493
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:57,160
Right. A private investigator.

494
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,870
Ms. Lee.

495
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:08,900
Are you feeling better?

496
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,400
You said you couldn't come in today.

497
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:13,840
Mr. Kim was looking for me, that's why.

498
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:16,140
We also have that PPL meeting later.

499
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,209
That meeting has been cancelled today.

500
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:21,380
There was a break-in at the assistant writer's home.

501
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,880
- At Oh Woo Ri's home? - Yes.

502
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,650
Someone in her family got hurt and is in the hospital.

503
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,390
(Sungho Hospital)

504
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,049
Woo Ri.

505
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:02,019
Yes?

506
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,420
Grandma's rosary.

507
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,729
She said it was a secret and told me not to tell you.

508
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,100
What secret?

509
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,830
Didn't she sound like...

510
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:16,940
that there's a long history with the rosary?

511
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,839
Grandma was lying.

512
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:22,169
Didn't she say it listens to your prayers?

513
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,109
That's also a lie.

514
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,180
Your grandmother...

515
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,449
is a great liar.

516
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:36,120
Whenever you had concerns, you prayed with her rosary.

517
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:38,120
Every time you prayed...

518
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,830
she eavesdropped on your prayers...

519
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,890
and helped you behind your back.

520
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,140
I don't want her to act silly at school.

521
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:58,580
I think I'm going to be really embarrassed by my mom.

522
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:02,249
You said you'd do a singing lesson for Teacher of the Day, right?

523
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,549
Yes, why?

524
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,149
You should change the subject.

525
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,620
What do you mean?

526
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:08,850
You should change it.

527
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,589
Is this the right thing to do?

528
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,759
Wouldn't a singing lesson be better?

529
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,859
Gosh.

530
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,100
Do you want to teach students trot songs?

531
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,698
I mean it doesn't have to be trot songs.

532
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:20,929
Just listen to what I say.

533
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,930
Everyone loves food.

534
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,739
This is so tiring.

535
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,679
Enjoy.

536
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,878
Enjoy.

537
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,238
(Teacher of the Day Program)

538
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,279
Did you all get one?

539
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,109
You guys are eating well.

540
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,890
Mom.

541
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:41,089
Thank you.

542
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,890
Grandma was my guardian angel.

543
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,730
Thank you, Grandma.

544
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:52,430
I'll be your guardian angel from now on.

545
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,299
I'll take care of everything,

546
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,969
from what you want to want you need.

547
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,069
Just as you did for me.

548
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:03,779
I'll take care of it.

549
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:07,649
So Grandma,

550
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,089
stop sleeping and wake up.

551
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,560
This way.

552
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,069
You must be worried...

553
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,870
since this happened so suddenly.

554
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,039
According to the test results,

555
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,910
she doesn't have any serious external injuries.

556
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:37,379
And since she moved to the ward, her vitals are back to normal.

557
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,250
I don't think you need to worry much now.

558
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,909
Doctor,

559
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,779
when will she wake up?

560
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,250
Well...

561
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,089
that's the most difficult part to say.

562
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,060
I heard you said that she was a strong woman...

563
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
and that she'd wake up.

564
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,500
Then, she'll definitely wake up.

565
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:01,699
She'll wake up soon.

566
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:06,040
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

567
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
It's the first time I heard something good since I got here.

568
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,309
I apologize for not being able...

569
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,350
to care for each patient and their families like we want to.

570
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,719
You must have been so startled.

571
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,489
Many who work as a doctor...

572
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,359
are still quite young.

573
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,359
They can't sleep...

574
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,430
and work frantically.

575
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,100
Let me apologize on their behalf.

576
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,330
It's okay.

577
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,069
Thank you, doctor.

578
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,600
It's nothing.

579
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,270
It's only natural for your family.

580
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,640
- Thank you. - Thank you.

581
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,779
Thank you.

582
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,710
Let's have a meal together next time.

583
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:12,739
Mom.

584
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:16,169
You said no one would get hurt.

585
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,529
You know how many people rushed over because you collapsed?

586
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,430
I'm so jealous.

587
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:46,199
You attracted enough attention...

588
00:38:47,669 --> 00:38:49,569
so please wake up.

589
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
I think I'll be annoyed if you keep this any longer.

590
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:56,149
Mom.

591
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,620
Please open your eyes now.

592
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:01,489
Stop making me cry.

593
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:06,989
Mom.

594
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,699
I really regretted saying those words to you because of a man.

595
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,699
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,140
I must have been crazy. He's not that important.

597
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,239
You are a lot more important to me.

598
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:26,109
Please forgive me.

599
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,850
Mom,

600
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,850
I'll break up with Hyung Sik.

601
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:35,649
As long as you wake up, I'll break up with him.

602
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,020
I promise.

603
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,160
So...

604
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,790
you just need to wake up.

605
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,879
Grandma.

606
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,310
Mom.

607
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,779
Gosh, Mom.

608
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,019
- Mom, you woke up! - Are you all right, Grandma?

609
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,119
Stop...

610
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,060
- What did you say, Mom? - Goodness.

611
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,589
Stop shaking me like that!

612
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:15,190
Mom, do you remember who I am?

613
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,960
- You? - Yes, who am I?

614
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:23,029
You are...

615
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,410
my troublemaker daughter who never listens to me.

616
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,679
- Grandma... - Mom.

617
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,980
Woo Ri.

618
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,520
Oh, she regained consciousness.

619
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,119
Mother, are you all right?

620
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,749
What? What are you doing here?

621
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,818
What do you mean? You collapsed.

622
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,859
Of course, I should be here.

623
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,129
You must be busy though.

624
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:51,799
I'm okay. I'm totally fine now.

625
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,128
I'll tell them to run some tests on you right away.

626
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:56,100
You're here too.

627
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,140
Yes. I'm so glad that you woke up.

628
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:01,409
Everyone is here.

629
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,239
Are we throwing a party or something?

630
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,480
Kang Jae. Where is Kang Jae?

631
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:08,749
Why are you looking for Kang Jae?

632
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,119
Some burglars broke in, and Kang Jae came to my rescue.

633
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,089
That's right, Grandma. Kang Jae carried you here.

634
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,690
Hey, Kang Jae. It's me.

635
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,759
Yes, Grandma woke up.

636
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,528
You were the first person she asked for.

637
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:27,168
Is she okay?

638
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:29,330
- Hold on. - Thanks.

639
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,709
Kang Jae, I heard you saved me.

640
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,279
No, Grandma. I'm so relieved that you woke up.

641
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,009
You saved my life.

642
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:44,049
Thank you, Kang Jae.

643
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,620
Grandma...

644
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,290
Don't cry.

645
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,169
- Are you okay now? - I'm fine.

646
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,569
Hey, are you all right?

647
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,580
Yes!

648
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,919
Hey, Kang Jae.

649
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,790
I heard Woo Ri's grandmother regained consciousness.

650
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,989
- Yes. - Thank goodness, seriously.

651
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,859
- Captain. - Yes.

652
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,198
There's something that exactly overlaps...

653
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,699
with the two years that Chairman Kim was gone.

654
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:37,698
Let's think it over before we tell Captain.

655
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:39,499
No. What is it? Tell me.

656
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,068
Raphael's battle with cancer.

657
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:43,209
What?

658
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,809
Raphael was battling cancer...

659
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,779
during the two years that Chairman Kim was gone.

660
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:48,878
As soon as he recovered and returned to work,

661
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:50,250
Chairman Kim came back too.

662
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:54,350
Kang Jae, do you think you're Detective Conan or something?

663
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,358
- Sorry? - Investigate!

664
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,020
Stop speculating.

665
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,459
The chairman of Diamond is close to the higher-ups.

666
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,059
It's already making my life difficult.

667
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,398
And what? You're after his son now?

668
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,628
If you snoop around without solid evidence,

669
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,299
we'll be on the chopping block before we catch the culprit.

670
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:13,709
Well, since when did we care so much about the higher-ups?

671
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,040
You already went there and caused trouble!

672
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,009
You see, the higher-ups are vying for a chance to teach you a lesson.

673
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:22,148
Stop talking nonsense.

674
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,379
Anyway, I'm relieved.

675
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,660
You have a new message.

676
00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:33,789
(Lee Kang Jae is coming too close.)

677
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,160
(I'm struggling to keep him in check.)

678
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:38,858
(We should send him on vacation. I'll help you.)

679
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:39,859
(Message sent)

680
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,669
Kang Jae, this came for you.

681
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,139
What is this? Who sent it?

682
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,369
The courier left it out front.

683
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,409
The conscripted officers brought it in.

684
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,910
Goodness. They should've checked.

685
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,509
(To Lee Kang Jae)

686
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:58,449
What is this?

687
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,319
Isn't this for a safe?

688
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,859
Where did I see this?

689
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,560
What? This is...

690
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:28,878
See? I told you.

691
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:30,778
Home is much safer than some motel.

692
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:33,350
You won't run into Park Du Pal at work.

693
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,719
Just listen to me and...

694
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:44,399
Hey, Park Du Pal.

695
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,129
Don't do this. If you want money, I'll give you however much you want.

696
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,769
- Don't do this, okay? - I don't need money.

697
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,099
Then what do you want?

698
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,910
I'll give you whatever it is that you want.

699
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,810
Just put the knife down, and we'll talk it out.

700
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,009
What can you do for me?

701
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:03,620
You see, I wanted to get a decent job...

702
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,379
and live a happy life with Mal Ja.

703
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,919
I had decided to devote myself to making her happy.

704
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:11,919
But...

705
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:15,759
you beat me up just because we registered our marriage.

706
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,160
That's why I caused the accident, and I'm an ex-con now.

707
00:45:22,169 --> 00:45:23,799
You two ruined my life.

708
00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:27,068
I just want to end everything now.

709
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:30,009
If you want to end your life, go ahead.

710
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,439
But please let my daughter go.

711
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,509
No.

712
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,778
I need someone to keep me company.

713
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,890
Hey, you're... You're still so young and can turn things around.

714
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:44,390
Why would you end your life?

715
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,890
Put that down.

716
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:49,759
I said, put it down.

717
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,029
Put it down.

718
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:55,168
Mom, do something!

719
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,999
Hey, don't... Don't die.

720
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,939
Do something!

721
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,668
Du Pal. I mean, sir!

722
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:06,209
Sir! Please forgive me. I'm really sorry.

723
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,279
Please... Please forgive me.

724
00:46:11,149 --> 00:46:12,279
Lee Mal Ja.

725
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:17,160
I loved you.

726
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,190
Let's meet again in our next life.

727
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,410
Mom...

728
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,580
Mal Ja!

729
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,350
Mal Ja!

730
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,559
Mal Ja!

731
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,690
No, Mal Ja...

732
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,529
Mom.

733
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,680
Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?

734
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,120
Mom, I see that you can walk.

735
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:29,390
Why were you in that wheelchair for the past three years? Just why?

736
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,859
To make me obey everything you say?

737
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,330
Is that it?

738
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,829
I only did it out of love.

739
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,469
I don't want to hear it!

740
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:40,969
You deceived me for three years!

741
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,609
You scumbag!

742
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:49,850
What on earth have you done?

743
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,620
I need to talk to you.

744
00:47:57,089 --> 00:47:58,859
Hear me out, okay?

745
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:04,759
I'll take my hand off. Don't scream, okay?

746
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,609
Hey, your mom can walk!

747
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,109
What?

748
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:22,149
Last but not least, I need to say this.

749
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:26,319
She doesn't love you, Mal Ja.

750
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,819
So you don't love yourself either.

751
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:35,830
I could see it so clearly.

752
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,060
So as a man who loved you, it broke my heart.

753
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,160
Don't worry, Raphael. I'm okay now.

754
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:08,689
Thank you.

755
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,859
Okay, go inside and get some rest.

756
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:13,359
I'm so glad you could come home soon.

757
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,969
Thank you for everything.

758
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,469
Visit us sometime. I'll make you dinner.

759
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:19,599
May I?

760
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,239
You're always welcome at our house.

761
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:22,969
Thank you.

762
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:26,940
We'll see you inside.

763
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:29,079
What? Wait.

764
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,310
- Good night. - Bye.

765
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:38,890
You must've been really worried and scared today.

766
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,160
You should go inside and rest up.

767
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,660
Raphael.

768
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:49,129
Thank you so much, for real.

769
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:50,870
I really mean it.

770
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:56,008
Gosh, I didn't even do anything.

771
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:58,039
Then why don't you let me take you out on a date?

772
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,580
And please call me when you have some time.

773
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:04,979
I'm off tomorrow.

774
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,249
So am I. Then we should hang out tomorrow.

775
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,819
I can see you tomorrow, right?

776
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,160
Yes.

777
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:22,299
What? That was so quick.

778
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,398
We left you two alone so you could talk.

779
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:26,040
I'm going to see him tomorrow.

780
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,608
Grandma, go inside and get some rest.

781
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,769
Why are you still here?

782
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,710
She's full of energy now.

783
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,738
I'm still a little dizzy,

784
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,350
but I'm trying not to show it because I don't want to worry you.

785
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,819
Grandma.

786
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:41,719
Your rosary broke.

787
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,449
Oh, no.

788
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,960
I wonder if it can be fixed.

789
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,029
From now on, I'm your guardian angel.

790
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,930
My guardian angel? Why?

791
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,099
You've been my guardian angel all my life,

792
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,799
so I'm going to protect you from now on.

793
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:57,198
Right by your side.

794
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,398
My gosh.

795
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:01,609
You're such a sweetie.

796
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:04,080
What about you?

797
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,378
Me? What about me?

798
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:08,008
When I collapsed, did you think of...

799
00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:10,449
doing anything for me like my sweet granddaughter here?

800
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:13,520
Mom.

801
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:15,890
I'm going to stop seeing Hyung Sik.

802
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,890
Why? You neglected me and went on about your boyfriend.

803
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:23,529
And I was wrong.

804
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,899
- I should break up with him. - Really?

805
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,370
Then can I continue seeing Chun Sam?

806
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:30,870
By all means.

807
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,210
What?

808
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:09,669
This jerk.

809
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,009
My gosh. How many passports does he have?

810
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,149
US dollars, the Japanese yen...

811
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:22,149
Here it is.

812
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,278
When you're fixated on something, you go on about it like this.

813
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:53,878
Honestly, I'm sick of it now.

814
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,750
Kang Jae, we can't be sure yet.

815
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:57,218
We have to look further into it.

816
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:59,959
You're fixated on the fact that Raphael was fighting cancer...

817
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,329
during the two years that Chairman Kim was gone,

818
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,659
so you're making this up.

819
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,988
Come on. I've known you long enough!

820
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,730
I swear, I'm not making it up.

821
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:07,969
We just need a warrant. Then it's game over.

822
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:09,929
Please.

823
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,140
- Trust me just this once. - That's enough!

824
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:13,898
I feel drained now because of you.

825
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,169
Gosh, I'm exhausted. I need to go eat something.

826
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:17,839
Wait, Captain.

827
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,480
What?

828
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,449
You saw it?

829
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,859
I saw it, with my own two eyes.

830
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,169
What is this place? Is it a castle?

831
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:49,969
This is so cool.

832
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,419
What is this place?

833
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:03,949
It's a restaurant.

834
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,319
- Please leave. - What is going on?

835
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,029
- Hey! - What now?

836
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,799
We have a warrant.

837
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:14,330
We need you to open the safe for us.

838
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:18,770
Where is Raphael?

839
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:20,910
He's off today, sir.

840
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,068
The safe? Why? What's in it?

841
00:54:23,069 --> 00:54:24,140
Just open it.

842
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:26,579
And you'll see.

843
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,580
He's not here, so how can I open it? I don't know the password.

844
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,879
Oh, that's...

845
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:33,919
We brought some tools for that.

846
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:36,290
- Right? - Yes.

847
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,919
Please cooperate.

848
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,560
Move aside.

849
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:45,399
Thank you, sir.

850
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:50,500
Let's see. It was somewhere around here.

851
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:55,410
- Captain, cover me. - I got you.

852
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:56,810
Let's see.

853
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,980
Six, four, seven, one...

854
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,640
- Four. - Four?

855
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,419
Hey, what is this?

856
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:13,060
What? Where did everything go?

857
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,190
Lee Kang Jae, you're in deep trouble now.

858
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:19,600
What? The necklace was right here.

859
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,830
I swear, I saw it last night.

860
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,099
What are we going to tell the chairman now?

861
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,839
You got it open. So what's in the safe?

862
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,468
Well...

863
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:31,109
We must've been mistaken.

864
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:32,739
Listen, you cops.

865
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:34,750
Must you keep this up?

866
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,749
Are you going to keep doing this to us?

867
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,648
I clearly told you I wouldn't just sit back and watch.

868
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:40,048
We're just trying to investigate...

869
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:41,219
Get out!

870
00:55:41,419 --> 00:55:42,589
Get out, all of you.

871
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,149
Where is Raphael? Call him now.

872
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:45,660
The thing is, sir.

873
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:47,488
He told us not to contact him today.

874
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:48,489
Why not?

875
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:50,759
He's out on a date.

876
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:53,199
He said he wouldn't pick up.

877
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:11,719
Do you like it?

878
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,680
Yes.

879
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:21,890
What is it?

880
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,660
We're the only ones here.

881
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,629
I guess the restaurant isn't doing so well.

882
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:29,469
But it's nice here.

883
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,770
Oh, that's...

884
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:38,639
I know, right?

885
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,680
I guess they don't get many customers.

886
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:44,719
Sir, it's ready.

887
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:46,879
Thank you.

888
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,349
What is it? Is something up?

889
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,489
No.

890
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:53,089
Just a moment.

891
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:11,710
There's...

892
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,239
a lady I like.

893
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,219
Lately, she's been having a hard time.

894
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:19,719
So I hope...

895
00:57:20,379 --> 00:57:21,890
this will entertain her even if it's brief.

896
00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:38,669
No way.

897
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,799
That can't be.

898
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:46,509
Don't tell me...

899
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,379
No way.

900
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,029
Has he been watching old-school dramas?

901
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,600
Don't sing.

902
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,069
Seriously, don't.

903
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,850
The door opens

904
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,219
And you enter

905
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,989
The moment I first saw you

906
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:31,219
- Woo Ri! - I knew

907
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,719
Woo Ri.

908
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,128
- Kang Jae. - Detective Lee, why...

909
00:58:35,129 --> 00:58:36,488
Let's go.

910
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:37,559
- What? - Hey.

911
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,330
- What's wrong? - Detective Lee!

912
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,168
What's the matter?

913
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:42,169
Come on. Let's go.

914
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,100
Why are you being like this, all of a sudden?

915
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,310
Detective Lee, what's going on?

916
00:58:49,669 --> 00:58:51,310
You can't be with this man!

917
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:32,449
(Woori the Virgin)

918
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,619
Just sleep here.

919
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,088
I'm so excited about the next three days.

920
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:36,890
You can't do this knowing we're under the same roof.

921
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,419
Raphael, let's set a date.

922
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:40,789
I've never felt this sure before.

923
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,659
This is what it's really like to have a family.

924
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,930
I'm watching you.

925
00:59:44,029 --> 00:59:45,560
I know who Chairman Kim is.

926
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,628
I spotted a face we know in the footage.

927
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:49,469
Kim Bok Rae is the prime suspect in the case.

928
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,930
- Do you have evidence? - Yes.

929
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:53,000
Will you marry me?

930
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,580
