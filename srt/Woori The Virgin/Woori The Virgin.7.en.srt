00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:37,303
We're over.

10
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:40,343
I mean it.

11
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:46,182
(Episode 7)

(My Warm Spring)

13
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:32,422
We've been dating for over 100 days now.

14
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:33,663
"Lee Kang Jae, Youth Department"?

15
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,492
My name is still saved like that?

16
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,762
Then how should I change it?

17
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:41,773
"Kang Jae"?

18
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,173
With a heart emoji?

19
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:47,143
Give me that.

20
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,712
- We met in April, you know. - Yes.

21
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,413
And...

22
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:58,283
this is the kind of person I want to be to you.

23
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:01,492
Like spring that always follows winter.

24

(Delete Contact)

27
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:27,413
(Are you sure you want to delete this contact?)

28
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:34,253
(Cancel, Delete)

29
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,472
(Sensational! Scandalous!)

30
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,443
Hey, Woo Ri. What should we have for lunch?

31
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,202
I'm not hungry.

32
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,972
Hey, don't tell me you're on a diet.

33
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,843
Don't even lose 1g.

34
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,343
Even your fat is part of you.

35
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,882
Why would I go on a diet when I'm pregnant?

36
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:02,182
Oh, sorry.

37
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,252
How about sushi?

38
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,623
I'll order 2 servings. 1 for me, 1 for your baby.

39
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:07,452
Remember the restaurant we went to with Kang Jae?

40
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,752
The delicious raw fish on the shiny rice.

41
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:11,862
You said it was the best sushi ever. I'll order from that place!

42
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:13,892
They say you shouldn't eat raw fish when you're pregnant.

43
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,063
Right, sorry.

44
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:18,201
And please don't talk about Kang Jae.

45
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:20,533
Why not? Did you guys break up or something?

46
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,701
Yes.

47
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,231
My gosh, look at you.

48
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:24,602
You're making a joke of it?

49
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:29,512
Wait, for real?

50
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:31,843
Yes, we broke up.

51
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,153
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?

52
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,452
I mean, why?

53
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,723
Should we have a drink?

54
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,493
Sweet and sour pork with kaoliang liquor?

55
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,533
Why don't we do that so you can tell me what happened?

56
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:54,903
I can't drink because I'm pregnant.

57
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,533
Right, sorry.

58
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,003
I'm okay.

59
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,973
We have a lot to do before the deadline.

60
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,112
What can I do to comfort a pregnant woman...

61
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,253
who's going through a breakup?

62
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:14,723
Darn it!

63
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,722
You should've told me.

64
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,193
I can't believe you went ahead and signed the divorce papers.

65
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,863
I just...

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,793
want Raphael...

67
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:26,933
to be happy.

68
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,201
You're too tenderhearted for your own good.

69
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,972
That's why you signed the papers. Gosh, you poor thing.

70
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:40,212
Sir, you have a guest.

71
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,383
Hello.

72
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,152
- Mom? - Ms. Byun.

73
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,091
What brings you to Korea?

74
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,661
When did you arrive?

75
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:57,392
I had a meeting in Hong Kong, so I stopped by on my way there.

76
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,762
Mom, you didn't even tell me that you were coming.

77
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:02,603
You've been...

78
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,743
taking such good care of my daughter, Ma Ri.

79
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,113
Since I live abroad,

80
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,211
I can't visit you often.

81
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:11,641
I am sorry about that.

82
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,712
Oh, don't be. Don't worry about it at all.

83
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:17,113
You don't look so good.

84
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:19,983
So?

85
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:23,022
You guys are getting a divorce?

86
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:24,993
Seriously?

87
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:34,902
When did you arrive?

88
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,572
You must be busy. I'm surprised you're here.

89
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:41,613
I'm happy I get to see you before I leave.

90
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:51,353
- Honey. - She's gone.

91
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,081
- Come on. - Let's go.

92
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,183
Okay.

93
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,892
Bok Rae.

94
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:04,233
Yes.

95
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,032
She is one magnanimous lady.

96
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,133
Regarding your divorce, she said it was up to you guys.

97
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,641
Okay, good.

98
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,442
Leave it to us, and don't worry.

99
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,972
No, you two cannot get a divorce.

100
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,212
Everyone makes mistakes.

101
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:21,043
What? You're calling it a mistake?

102
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:23,353
Father.

103
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,722
A mistake is...

104
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,752
leaving your phone at a restaurant after having a meal there.

105
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:28,993
That is a mistake.

106
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,492
Things like, getting on the subway and realizing you're supposed...

107
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:32,591
to go the other way...

108
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,363
and being late to a meeting because you got the time wrong.

109
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,102
Planning a rendezvous and getting physical is not a mistake!

110
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:40,363
It's not like you can always take the same expressway every day.

111
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,202
You can take a national highway from time to time.

112
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,641
That's enough, Father.

113
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,103
Ma Ri does so much for us.

114
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,972
I need Ma Ri more than you.

115
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,482
Father.

116
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,641
Ma Ri's mother...

117
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:56,452
will help us form a joint venture with a clinic in China.

118
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:58,021
I will...

119
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,221
open a clinic in China where...

120
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:01,391
its 1.4 billion citizens can get double eyelid surgery,

121
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,553
so you're not getting a divorce.

122
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:04,722
What?

123
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:07,793
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,793
What does double eyelid surgery...

125
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:11,433
have to do with us getting a divorce?

126
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:14,063
Will you explain what's going on? Please!

127
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,243
My dream?

128
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,673
You tell me first.

129
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:59,113
- What's your dream? - Me?

130
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:01,813
It's nothing special.

131
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:05,383
I just want to meet my better half, marry her,

132
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:06,853
and have a kid.

133
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:10,392
I want to have dinner with my family.

134
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,563
Home-cooked food.

135
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:14,733
Eating home-cooked food with your family?

136
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,532
I do that every day.

137
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,102
Sure, some do.

138
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,103
But some people never get to do it their whole lives.

139
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:23,932
What is just a part of your mundane life...

140
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,803
could be something that someone wants so desperately.

141
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,072
Now, it's your turn.

142
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,313
Tell me.

143
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:32,113
What's your dream?

144
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,383
My dream is...

145
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,842
Mom!

146
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:10,412
I can't believe you showed up like that without telling me.

147
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,252
You totally surprised me.

148
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,083
This way, it looks more natural.

149
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,593
So? I was right, wasn't I?

150
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:17,291
The tables have turned, right?

151
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,922
Yes. We have totally won over the chairman.

152
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:23,662
He said we could not get a divorce. He yelled at Raphael!

153
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,463
Mal Ja, you're here!

154
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:29,633
Darn it.

155
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:31,542
You didn't gag him?

156
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:34,041
He promised me that he wouldn't shout.

157
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,073
Du Pal has a way with words.

158
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:39,843
When I'm chatting with him, time just flies by.

159
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:40,982
Did you have dinner?

160
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,452
I had tteokbokki with your mom.

161
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,411
Spice level three. It was so spicy.

162
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:45,482
Look at you.

163
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,953
You seem quite comfortable now, tied up in that chair.

164
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:50,753
I'm afraid I'd get used to this.

165
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,762
Hey, I initially asked for one million dollars,

166
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:54,391
but I'll give you a 90-percent discount.

167
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,993
Just give me 100,000, and I'll get lost.

168
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,362
You're being ridiculous.

169
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,732
Why would I give you 100,000 dollars?

170
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,632
I can just keep you tied to that chair forever.

171
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,802
That's true.

172
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,401
But isn't it too much work to feed and bathe me...

173
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,502
for the rest of my life?

174
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,242
Isn't it better to pay me and be done with it?

175
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:11,112
We could also just take care of you...

176
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,182
without having to feed you or give you a single penny.

177
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:16,583
- Did you pick up some tarps? - Yes.

178
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,682
- Lay it down on the floor. - Okay.

179
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:21,083
Why would you need to lay down a tarp?

180
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,723
Hey, why do you need that?

181
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,691
- Hey. Mom! - Is this big enough?

182
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,691
I don't want to force you to give me the money if you have none.

183
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,332
It is big enough for a man.

184
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,432
Should I just leave quietly?

185
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:34,832
Mom! Mal Ja!

186
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,531
I'm sorry for everything, Mal Ja.

187
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:40,902
Put that tarp away!

188
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,583
How about we have some boiled pork today?

189
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,412
Mal Ja, go get 600g of pork belly... No, make that a kilo.

190
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,022
Hey! Shut your mouth.

191
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:56,392
Mom! I told you to gag him.

192
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,791
This way, it's less boring.

193
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,891
Yes. Fresh kimchi must be eaten with boiled pork.

194
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:04,792
Let's have some, okay?

195
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,902
I'm home.

196
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:15,312
You're back. Why are you home so late?

197
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:16,573
Have you had dinner yet?

198
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:19,512
Yes, I've eaten. I'll be in my room.

199
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:23,282
Woo Ri, sit down for a moment.

200
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:32,093
Kang Jae told us what happened.

201
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,863
Why did you suddenly make such a decision?

202
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,892
It's not sudden.

203
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,062
I thought long and hard.

204
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,633
Yes, we know that you'd never do anything rash.

205
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:48,343
But why don't you think about it just once more?

206
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:52,743
Woo Ri, it could be because your hormones are out of whack right now.

207
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:55,511
You should think about everything more carefully at a time like this.

208
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,281
Take some time and think about...

209
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,953
I thought long and hard.

210
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,353
I won't change my mind.

211
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,593
Why did you break up with him?

212
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:08,062
Can't you at least tell us the reason?

213
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,633
Kang Jae lied to me,

214
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,931
so I can't trust him anymore.

215
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,203
Are you sure you're not the one who's lying?

216
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:21,041
Last time, you said you felt bad...

217
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,372
because you made him lie.

218
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,672
Is that why you're doing this?

219
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:27,113
Thank you for your concern,

220
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,353
but please leave it to me.

221
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,662
I feel so bad for both Kang Jae and Woo Ri.

222
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,662
Dear Lord, have mercy.

223
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:15,333
Are you not feeling well? You look a little pale.

224
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:19,432
I'm fine.

225
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,573
Hey, you're here.

226
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:24,802
Come inside.

227
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,203
(Attorney Nam Hyung Wook)

228
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:35,113
What do you think?

229
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:40,123
Medical malpractice lawsuits are such headaches.

230
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,521
Hospitals are in possession of all the records and evidence,

231
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,722
so doctors are more likely to win.

232
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,223
That is exactly why I came to see you, my friend.

233
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,561
We swore brotherhood...

234
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,833
at the golf course, you know?

235
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,502
Sure thing, brother. You know me.

236
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:02,442
I will trample all over them.

237
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,012
It's okay. I can go alone.

238
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,613
Bye.

239
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,223
She doesn't seem to be feeling too well today.

240
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:18,093
Does she feel bad that we've decided to sue them?

241
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,292
No, it's not that.

242
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,892
Gosh, I'm not sure if I can tell you but...

243
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,262
She broke up with her boyfriend.

244
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,503
What? Why?

245
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,343
I couldn't even ask.

246
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,272
She must be devastated.

247
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:40,182
It's affecting her physically. She's not even eating.

248
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,983
- She's not eating? - No.

249
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:46,282
She can't even sleep. She's having a hard time.

250
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,993
I hope she gets over it soon.

251
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,892
She can't sleep? That's not good.

252
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:56,262
I heard a mother's emotions were transferred to her baby.

253
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,603
("Mask of Desire")

254
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,103
Hello, Ms. Oh.

255
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:05,742
What is all this?

256
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:08,911
Woo Ri, let's eat. It's on Raphael!

257
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:10,312
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

258
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,383
I just want you to eat lots of good food.

259
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,411
This is way too much food for the three of us.

260
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,452
If we can't finish it, you can take it home.

261
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,921
- Right? - Good idea.

262
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:21,822
I should tell my mom not to make dinner today!

263
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:22,953
Nice!

264
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,302
I guess you like quail eggs.

265
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,243
Have more.

266
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:42,212
Yes, you've barely eaten anything for the past few days.

267
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:43,772
Eat up! You must be hungry.

268
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:45,542
You can't do that.

269
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,113
You must eat at least two servings at every meal.

270
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,493
I'm going to step out for some air.

271
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:11,702
What's with her?

272
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,072
- Good job today! - Thank you!

273
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,213
- Bye. - See you!

274
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,442
Ms. Oh.

275
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,682
I heard you were single.

276
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,453
Sorry? Oh, yes.

277
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:27,982
Why do you ask?

278
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:31,552
Well, I know that I'm quite charming,

279
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:34,322
but my son is even more charming.

280
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:38,192
I'd like you to meet my son.

281
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,633
There he is.

282
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:49,113
Mr. Jung, meet Ms. Oh.

283
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,772
- Hello. - Hello.

284
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:55,383
Eun Ran!

285
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:57,953
- Here. - Hey, what's up?

286
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,392
I came because I knew you'd be done by now.

287
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,593
Really? To give me a ride?

288
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,033
Nice.

289
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,533
Eun Ran.

290
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,902
What? Why so serious?

291
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,543
- Got something to say? - Well...

292
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:23,142
You see, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

293
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:26,782
About you and I...

294
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,843
About us?

295
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,182
I thought we were done talking about that.

296
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:34,053
We decided to just stay friends.

297
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,692
Right, I know. But I thought about it,

298
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,891
and it's not like we're seeing each other just for fun and...

299
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:43,263
- You know? - Hold on.

300
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:47,833
- Hello, Mr. Jung! - Mr. Jung?

301
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,273
The day after tomorrow?

302
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:53,702
Oh, no. I'm supposed to...

303
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:58,982
No, that works.

304
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,912
Okay, let's have dinner together.

305
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:03,583
Yes, I know that place.

306
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:06,452
Okay, see you then.

307
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:09,222
Who is Mr. Jung?

308
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,191
Must I tell you everything?

309
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,191
He's just a guy I'm seeing.

310
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,932
I see, so you have someone.

311
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,863
What?

312
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,273
Even if I were to date someone, you have no say in it.

313
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,802
That's right. I don't.

314
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,972
I'm seeing someone too. I mean, everyone has someone.

315
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,013
Really? That's great.

316
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,712
Oh, where were we?

317
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:35,181
Forget it. It was nothing important.

318
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,411
Anyway, you said Woo Ri broke up with her boyfriend.

319
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:40,751
What do we do? My goodness.

320
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,092
I know. I'm so upset because of Woo Ri.

321
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:46,161
I mean, why did she...

322
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:48,492
Anyway, where are you going for dinner the day after tomorrow?

323
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:50,533
What?

324
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:53,002
Where is the complaint?

325
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:54,502
Is this it?

326
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,133
Oh, they haven't filed it yet.

327
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,401
But they want to sue you?

328
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,201
Why? Why all of a sudden?

329
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:03,343
I don't know. What should I do?

330
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,682
Does this mean my career as a doctor is over now?

331
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,981
What? Their attorney is...

332
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,353
Is it who I'm thinking?

333
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,722
This is getting my competitive juices flowing.

334
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,553
Don't worry about a thing.

335
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,263
Come on, hurry!

336
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,991
Ms. Yu, we're having the meeting at this fancy place?

337
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:26,461
Aren't we meeting with the production company?

338
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,632
Right? Isn't this place so amazing?

339
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,033
Come on, hurry.

340
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:34,942
My, check out this amazing view!

341
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:39,242
Ms. Yu, when will everyone else get here?

342
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,613
Woo Ri, can't you just enjoy it?

343
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,652
Enjoy the view and relax a little, okay?

344
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:48,023
Ms. Yu, what's going on?

345
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:49,952
Aren't we here for a meeting?

346
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,293
Come here.

347
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:54,263
First, unpack.

348
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,492
Then we'll go to this place.

349
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,833
"Mom's Body Treatment Spa"?

350
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:01,961
What is this?

351
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,133
You need a little pampering right now.

352
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,442
You're not eating or sleeping because you broke up.

353
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,112
Then, it's not good for you or the baby.

354
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,971
Are we here because of me?

355
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,212
Of course, I came because of you.

356
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:14,342
Gosh, you're crazy. Don't you know how expensive this place is?

357
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:16,813
We should get a refund and leave.

358
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,853
Yes.

359
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:20,481
I have no money.

360
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:22,523
I'm having trouble paying back my loan too.

361
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:26,263
Raphael asked me to bring you here.

362
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,662
Go get your spa treatment, and let's have a nice dinner.

363
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:30,592
Let's enjoy our vacation.

364
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:32,563
Let me enjoy this thanks to you.

365
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,202
Oh my gosh. I have dibs on this bed.

366
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,103
- Are you enjoying it? - Yes, it's delicious.

367
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:43,672
It's really delicious.

368
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:45,241
Have you been here often?

369
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:48,182
Yes. I heard their food was nice. So, I brought you here on purpose.

370
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:53,252
Aren't you Mr. Choi Seoung Il, the actor?

371
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,823
No, I'm not.

372
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,553
You are. I'm such a big fan.

373
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:01,492
Hey, what are you doing here?

374
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,563
He is Choi Seoung Il.

375
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:06,662
Eun Ran,

376
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:09,502
What brings you here?

377
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:11,372
I came here to have a meal.

378
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,343
Did you come here looking for me? Why?

379
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:15,912
Of course, not. I had a meeting here.

380
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,813
Hello. I'm Choi Seoung Il. It's nice to meet you.

381
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,543
Hello. I'm Jung Hyung Sik.

382
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,383
But who is he?

383
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,513
He's a friend of mine.

384
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,082
A long time friend.

385
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,352
I'm Oh Eun Ran's friend and the father of her daughter,

386
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,593
Oh Woo Ri.

387
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:34,093
Right. I heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.

388
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:35,992
What have you heard about me?

389
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,932
I was talking about Woo Ri, and said she had a father.

390
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:42,731
Go back to your work so I can have my meal.

391
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:43,732
Right.

392
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:44,803
You know me, don't you?

393
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,701
DiCaprio of the dramas.

394
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:48,971
- A star. - Yes, of course.

395
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,073
I said to go.

396
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,083
Let's have a meal together.

397
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:54,481
Sure, let's do that.

398
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:55,712
- When? - Excuse me?

399
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,251
Since you said yes,

400
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,883
we should set a date.

401
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:01,123
Hey!

402
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,452
Can I have your autograph?

403
00:22:04,652 --> 00:22:05,662
The timing...

404
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,343
Gosh, Raphael.

405
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:24,972
You are having a relaxing time, aren't you?

406
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,813
I came by to give you this.

407
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:28,912
I don't know what to say.

408
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,553
But Woo Ri left without saying anything.

409
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,123
And she won't answer her phone either.

410
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,023
Right.

411
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:38,922
Raphael,

412
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,692
I should...

413
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,162
check out of the room, right?

414
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,732
No, not at all. You can enjoy the room.

415
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:47,401
And this as well.

416
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:48,461
Even this?

417
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:49,573
Thank you.

418
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:51,731
Gosh.

419
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:53,543
You keep giving me so much.

420
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,613
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

421
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,333
What are you doing here?

422
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:19,863
Detective.

423
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:23,971
I was just worried about Woo Ri's condition.

424
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,002
She isn't doing so well.

425
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:28,672
Why are you worried about that?

426
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,941
What do you mean why?

427
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,312
I'm the baby's father.

428
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:34,842
The mother's health is directly related to the baby's health.

429
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:36,053
Of course, I'm concerned.

430
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,883
By the way, what brings you here?

431
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,422
It's none of your business.

432
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,962
Why did you break up?

433
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,833
Well,

434
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:53,832
is it because she got pregnant...

435
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,773
and that became a problem for you, didn't it?

436
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,603
Is there anything I can do for the two of you?

437
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,702
Stop minding our business.

438
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:19,392
You call this a settlement?

439
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:22,062
Are you playing games here?

440
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,692
Or you can take this to court.

441
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,033
You know it will be unfavorable for you if we do.

442
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,902
- Should we still take it to court? - Why is it unfavorable?

443
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,043
We will prove that Ms. Oh answered to the wrong name while dozing off.

444
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,342
Let's take this to court.

445
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:38,642
There's a witness saying Ms. Yeo was emotionally unstable that day.

446
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:42,283
Hey!

447
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:45,383
Do you want to have a go at me?

448
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,982
You will be crushed in court, again.

449
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:49,692
You lost three times already.

450
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:50,853
Did you just say "hey"?

451
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:55,323
Stop talking down on me!

(Law Firm IE)

453
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:58,763
That was just a lucky win.

454
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,133
Sure, let's go to court.

455
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:03,803
Let's see who wins this time.

456
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,902
Wait, come here.

457
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:08,543
Come sit.

458
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,672
Have some conscience.

459
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:13,883
Can you really say those words, having seen Ms. Oh?

460
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,853
A perfectly normal, single woman ended up getting pregnant.

461
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,882
You left a big scar on her mind and body.

462
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,522
And destroyed her life.

463
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,353
I mean can you really say those words?

464
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:26,492
Excuse me,

465
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:28,422
can you be more careful with your words?

466
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:31,333
We are on the same side...

467
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:33,932
We are...

468
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:38,502
but it's not something you can say in front of the mother and baby.

469
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:43,573
Let's go for a meal.

470
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,742
Just a second, Ms. Oh.

471
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:48,912
Yes?

472
00:25:49,853 --> 00:25:52,553
I tried to look the other way,

473
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,883
but you looked really tired.

474
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,892
So I really want to help you.

475
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,563
I'm really worried.

476
00:26:01,323 --> 00:26:02,492
I'm okay.

477
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,731
But I'm sure I can...

478
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:05,863
Sir.

479
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:10,002
You called the caterers, booked a hotel,

480
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:11,633
and I'm grateful for all that.

481
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,972
I know you are worried about the baby.

482
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:18,773
But, I'm taking care of the baby well.

483
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,412
Right.

484
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:26,323
Just one more thing.

485
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,093
About the lawsuit.

486
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:37,162
I didn't understand why you didn't want to do this in the beginning,

487
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,962
but I think I understand now.

488
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:41,732
So, I'm wondering...

489
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:44,073
if we should we stop this.

490
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:50,472
For us, this baby is a gift and a grateful thing to happen to us.

491
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:52,813
But,

492
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:54,712
rather than going through a lawsuit...

493
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:58,013
that uses negative words like "accidents" and "disaster".

494
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,323
I think it's better not to go through with it at all.

495
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,633
That's why you were like this.

496
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,232
Didn't I tell you...

497
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,573
to do something about it earlier?

498
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:20,602
You're stupid.

499
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:22,672
How can you break up after holding hands for two years?

500
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:27,613
- I thought I'd get married. - Gosh.

501
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:34,152
I knew it when I first saw Woo Ri.

502
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,293
"She's the one".

503
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,192
That's why while I was dating her,

504
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:44,363
I wasn't worried at all.

505
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,533
Even if we didn't do anything,

506
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,833
everything was fine as long as I had her.

507
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:53,501
Then, what are you doing here?

508
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:55,103
Go get her back.

509
00:27:57,172 --> 00:27:58,912
I thought everything would be okay if I was out of the picture.

510
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,343
What are you saying?

511
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,083
Kang Jae, you're such an idiot.

512
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,412
Go and talk to her again.

513
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,123
I think...

514
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:09,523
there's more to it than what Woo Ri has told you.

515
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:12,353
Yes, there must be a reason.

(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

517
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:25,273
Woo Ri.

518
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,642
Woo Ri, wait. Let's talk for a bit.

519
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,442
I have nothing to say.

520
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:32,912
I...

521
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,642
I thought about not seeing you.

522
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,211
I thought for days without sleep...

523
00:28:38,212 --> 00:28:40,422
about breaking up like this.

524
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,523
I don't think I can. I can't break up with you.

525
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,722
Seeing you makes it harder on me. So, please leave me alone.

526
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,333
Let's not do this.

527
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:54,962
Tell me your honest feelings.

528
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:57,502
We can correct the wrong.

529
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:58,803
Please, let's talk.

530
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:06,912
Seeing you makes me angry.

531
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,113
Let's not see each other.

532
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,583
Why did this happen to us?

533
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:13,952
Why should we be like this?

534
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:24,962
Yes.

535
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,603
You can scream at me.

536
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:29,702
I'm fine with it.

537
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:34,142
But there's someone you're forgetting.

538
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:39,442
The baby.

539
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:42,283
You can do whatever to me.

540
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,682
But not to the baby.

541
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,252
I beg of you.

542
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:08,502
Ms. Oh, it's time for your doctor's appointment.

543
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,343
We should go now.

544
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:29,023
- Ms. Oh! - Woo Ri.

(Emergency Center)

546
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,333
I heard she fainted.

547
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,832
Yes, she did. All of a sudden.

548
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:40,442
There are cases where you feel dizzy and faint during pregnancy.

549
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:44,112
You don't have to worry too much if you don't get hurt when falling.

550
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:47,613
She hasn't been eating well or sleeping these days.

551
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:51,512
- Will she be okay? - Yes, she just needs to rest well.

552
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:54,452
But her basal body temperature has gone down a bit.

553
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:58,123
Pregnant women in their early stages have a higher body temperature.

554
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:00,192
This is something you need to take care of.

555
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,092
There could be the risk of early miscarriage if you don't.

556
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,192
Excuse me? Miscarriage?

557
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,161
You don't have to worry about it now,

558
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:07,363
but please be careful.

559
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:09,671
She can leave when she wakes up,

560
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:11,802
but she shouldn't be exposed to stress.

561
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,343
You should try to help her avoid it.

562
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,441
Gosh.

563
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,343
Thank goodness, it's not worse.

564
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,582
Why did you lie to me?

565
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:27,722
Did you lie because you thought I wouldn't send the baby?

566
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:29,553
Woo Ri...

567
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:32,492
But there's someone you're forgetting.

568
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,162
The baby.

569
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:38,992
You can do whatever to me. But not to the baby.

Thank you.

You should get going.

Ms. Oh, I heard you weren't sleeping well.

581

I've been recording this for the baby.

582
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,842
I'm sending it just in case it helps.

("Thumbelina")

584

Gummy Bear, let me read you a fairy tale.

585
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:08,783
Here it goes.

586
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:14,092
"Once upon a time, there was a lady..."

587
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,623
"who longed for a baby."

588
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:19,731
"A fairy noticed her sincerity..."

589
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,732
"and gifted her a flower bud."

590
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,471
"When the flower bud bloomed on a warm spring day,"

591
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:29,303
"there was a small baby girl sleeping."

592
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:36,682
"Gosh. What a small beautiful girl!"

593
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:39,883
"The lady was overwhelmed with joy..."

594
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:44,093
"and named the little baby girl Thumbelina."

595
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,732
Kang Jae, aren't you going to eat?

596
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:00,103
No, I feel like it.

597
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,013
You should get some rest if you are not feeling well.

598
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:06,242
No, I'm fine.

599
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:09,482
I don't think you're in your right mind.

600
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:13,022
I'm fine. Don't worry.

601
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:20,022
What's this?

602
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,593
There's something in the shipment coming in Pier 3 in Incheon.

603
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,533
I'm convinced that it's related to Chairman Kim.

604
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,872
Gosh. It's tonight, isn't it?

605
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:42,312
That's it.

606
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:43,683
The container that's coming in right now.

607
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:45,553
What do you think is in it?

608
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,652
I wish we find something concrete.

609
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:58,192
What is that?

610
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:01,663
A person came out from it. Is he Chairman Kim?

611
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:02,863
No, it isn't.

612
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:05,602
He's definitely in the country.

613
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,642
He smuggled into the country.

614
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:09,843
Look at that bag.

615
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:12,143
If he's holding drugs, that's worth millions.

616
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:15,942
- Let's get him. - No, we shouldn't.

617
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,013
We need to catch the person he's meeting.

618
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,252
Chairman Kim.

619
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,203
- Is he here? - He's here.

620
00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:36,263
Okay, then.

621
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:51,883
Is it here?

622
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,093
This is the police. Put your hands up.

623
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,561
What is this? Are you sure this is the right place?

624
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:04,263
It is. He definitely walked in this room.

625
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,502
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

626
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,863
Yes. I saw him come in here.

627
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:20,413
Sir, thank you for looking into such a program.

628
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,613
No, it was nothing. You made a really good decision.

629
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,651
Exercising helps with your mood,

630
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,421
and since they say it's a program for the baby,

631
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:28,953
I think it'll be good for you to participate often.

632
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:31,823
Right. I will.

633
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,263
I also listened to the fairy tale you recorded.

634
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:38,192
I could feel that the baby enjoyed it as well.

635
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,663
That's good to hear.

636
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:50,271
Then, can we participate right away?

637
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:52,913
Of course. It'll start once you get changed.

638
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,211
I think you could go in.

639
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,283
The father should also get changed.

640
00:36:58,053 --> 00:36:59,082
Excuse me?

641
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,922
This is a yoga class for couples.

642
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,953
For couples?

643
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,461
I don't have a change of clothes.

644
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:10,792
She can't go in by herself. I will loan you the clothes.

645
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:12,692
I'm fine.

646
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:14,203
(We rent sportswear.)

647
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:16,061
It's okay.

648
00:37:16,062 --> 00:37:19,502
We will start. Please sit facing each other.

649
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:23,712
Touch at the feet and pull each other's arms.

650
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:25,243
Breathe out.

651
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,442
Open up your legs.

652
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,782
Husbands, pull the arms.

653
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:32,282
Breathe out, slowly.

654
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,152
Slowly, so that it stretches.

655
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:39,252
We're going to relax the hips.

656
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,922
Please, lean on your husbands.

657
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:43,961
- Please, lean back. - On me?

658
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,901
Yes. Turn around, and open your legs.

659
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:50,202
Please, sit in. Let me help.

660
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:51,302
Sit in the butterfly position...

661
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:53,073
and the husband's legs should go on top.

662
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:56,143
Breathe out and relax. Lean back comfortably.

663
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:05,652
We're going to open up your pelvic bones. Please lie down.

664
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:10,222
Please put the right leg on the shoulder.

665
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:12,052
Opening up the pelvis...

666
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:15,893
and breathe out. Relax.

667
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,962
- What are you doing? - Excuse me?

668
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,202
Relaxing the pelvis is the most important movement.

669
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:23,602
Right.

670
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:29,772
I think we should do it next time.

671
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:32,113
Why? Are you busy?

672
00:38:32,272 --> 00:38:35,082
You should help your wife.

673
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:36,612
Yes.

674
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:39,953
But I'm not the husband.

675
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,893
I am the father of the baby...

676
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:47,493
- Excuse me? - We'll just come back next time.

677
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:51,993
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

678
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:54,933
I didn't know this would be a couples' class.

679
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:56,803
No, it's okay.

680
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:00,402
I re-registered you in a class that you can attend alone.

681
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:02,843
Right. Thank you.

682
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,582
Oh, right. Here.

683
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:07,843
Thank you.

684
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:10,812
Gosh.

685
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,852
I came to relax my muscles but am getting muscle pain.

686
00:39:30,272 --> 00:39:32,332
Woo Ri, have some apples.

687
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,973
Thank you, Grandma.

688
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:38,073
Have you eaten dinner?

689
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:39,812
Yes, I did.

690
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:43,683
Are you feeling better now?

691
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:45,352
Are you still upset?

692
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:49,752
Grandma, I had a laughing moment today.

693
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,093
That's good to hear.

694
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,562
That's what feelings are.

695
00:39:56,962 --> 00:40:00,732
You may feel so upset that you can't do anything now,

696
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,163
but time will heal.

697
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:07,902
You were like a stone that got split in half on the riverside.

698
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:12,772
A round stone got a sharp edge.

699
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:15,081
But once time passes,

700
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:19,113
the stone's sharp edge will be round again.

701
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,053
Everything will be okay.

702
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,863
Grandma.

703
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:31,933
I'm still heartbroken.

704
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:36,263
I didn't think I could do anything because I was so heartbroken.

705
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:39,972
But how come I can still work,

706
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:42,102
eat, and sleep?

707
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:43,973
How come I can do everything?

708
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,542
Why am I smiling?

709
00:40:49,712 --> 00:40:52,082
What if time passes by, and I become completely fine?

710
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:54,852
What do I do then?

711
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:01,163
If I forget everything and move on with my life,

712
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:11,732
I'll feel awful for Kang Jae. What will I do then?

713
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:16,272
It's all right, Woo Ri.

714
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:18,942
Everything will be fine.

715
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,783
Everyone moves on.

716
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:35,791
We already investigated everything two days ago.

717
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,632
How will we find a man that already disappeared?

718
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:38,692
We lost him for good.

719
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,002
No.

720
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:41,462
I'm certain he went into this room.

721
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,303
You've been off your game lately.

722
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,002
It's possible to miss things during investigations.

723
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,073
Let's go.

724
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:52,772
No.

725
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,812
Is there a secret passage here?

726
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:57,212
Kang Jae.

727
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:59,712
You haven't been yourself after your breakup.

728
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,652
That's why we missed him.

729
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:06,493
It's not about her.

730
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:08,393
I'm sure he was here.

731
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:11,962
What is this about now?

732
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,033
Oh, Raphael.

733
00:42:14,663 --> 00:42:17,272
We need to tear down the wall and the floor of this room.

734
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:18,933
Come again?

735
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,372
You want to do what? Without my permission?

736
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:21,942
A suspect disappeared in this room.

737
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:24,243
This is enough.

738
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:26,211
I did everything to cooperate with you.

739
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,442
Now, I'm fed up too.

740
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:31,112
You must explain to me what you're doing here first.

741
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:32,613
Do you have a warrant?

742
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,981
I won't let you roam around my hospital without a warrant...

743
00:42:35,982 --> 00:42:37,093
based on mere suspicion.

744
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,152
Get out.

745
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,492
Sure.

746
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:41,723
I'll get you that warrant.

747
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:44,692
I'm going to turn this hospital upside down.

748
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,692
What did you say?

749
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:48,033
Sir.

750
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:49,633
Thank you for your cooperation.

751
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,932
We didn't even report this.

752
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,232
We won't get a warrant for a suspect we missed.

753
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:55,073
Are you out of your mind? Let's just go.

754
00:43:10,122 --> 00:43:11,453
What's wrong with this?

755
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:12,952
Sir.

756
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,493
The chairman is looking for you.

757
00:43:15,163 --> 00:43:16,832
Okay. But...

758
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:18,763
is that the plant...

759
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,202
my father is growing?

760
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:24,033
The one he wanted you to place wherever it was well-lit?

761
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:25,601
Right.

762
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:27,243
He's had it for more than ten years.

763
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:31,442
He was happy that the flower bloomed recently for the first time.

764
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:33,482
Why were the police here again?

765
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:36,243
They were pursuing a suspect.

766
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:38,882
And apparently, he disappeared in the hospital.

767
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,121
You should've cleaned up properly.

768
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:41,783
Why did you leave room to attract flies?

769
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:48,362
What's this about?

770
00:43:48,363 --> 00:43:49,593
Right. Personnel appointment.

771
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:51,792
Call her Director Lee now.

772
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:54,831
- What? - She's a valuable asset.

773
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,973
So she'll be a director now, not a team leader.

774
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:58,731
I'll work harder,

775
00:43:58,732 --> 00:44:00,771
so I won't let you down.

776
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,502
Gosh. You have a kind heart too.

777
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:10,683
Sir.

778
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,783
My baby...

779
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,883
Why...

780
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:17,351
What happened?

781
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:18,393
Someone knocked it over.

782
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:21,163
Who? Who did this?

783
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:23,163
Who is this scumbag?

784
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:33,672
Can I trust you?

785
00:44:39,312 --> 00:44:41,912
Mom told me not to let you go.

786
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:44,783
But I'm doing this behind her back because I know you're a nice guy.

787
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:48,322
If I let you go now, don't show your face around me.

788
00:44:48,323 --> 00:44:50,352
Okay. I'll be grateful if you let me go.

789
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:55,562
Don't ask me for money either.

790
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:39,272
You and your daughter...

791
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:54,922
Are you all right?

792
00:45:55,283 --> 00:45:56,723
Are you okay, my princess?

793
00:45:57,453 --> 00:46:00,662
I think my head is still ringing.

794
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:01,692
Oh, no.

795
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,593
That jerk deserves to die!

796
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:11,073
This isn't going to make me feel any better!

797
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,902
Mom, where's that thing?

798
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,771
I thought people casually talked about grabbing a meal...

799
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:45,933
as a way to greet each other.

800
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:49,101
What do you mean? It's nice to see everyone here today.

801
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:50,172
You agree, right?

802
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:51,872
Yes, this is nice.

803
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,442
It's nice to have a meal with an actor and an actress.

804
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:57,752
So how do you know him?

805
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,613
- Pardon? - Oh, us?

806
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:01,982
I told you before.

807
00:47:03,183 --> 00:47:04,752
We're dating.

808
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:08,562
Well,

809
00:47:08,863 --> 00:47:12,832
I had so much respect for him and used to follow him around.

810
00:47:13,062 --> 00:47:15,663
So I developed romantic feelings too.

811
00:47:17,232 --> 00:47:18,703
When did you start dating?

812
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:20,703
- A long time... - Recently...

813
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,643
Well,

814
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:24,972
I had respected him for a long time.

815
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:28,442
- But I recently developed feelings. - Right.

816
00:47:30,812 --> 00:47:32,012
I hope you don't mind.

817
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:33,823
Of course, not. I said I was fine.

818
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:35,553
By the way,

819
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:37,993
I heard you ran a security firm.

820
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,663
Right. I just started my firm.

821
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:43,192
If you need a security firm, do let me know.

822
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:47,102
Those big bodyguards dress up in black suits.

823
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,663
And I heard some of them were from rough neighborhoods.

824
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:52,232
A lot of them used to be athletes.

825
00:47:52,473 --> 00:47:54,572
When you get to know them, they are gentle-hearted.

826
00:47:54,573 --> 00:47:57,771
Then did you also have a rough life before you began...

827
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,743
running your firm?

828
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:01,442
I was an athlete.

829
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:02,811
What sport?

830
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,383
I did judo ever since I was a kid.

831
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,582
- Really? - Yes.

832
00:48:06,752 --> 00:48:08,282
I had no idea.

833
00:48:08,283 --> 00:48:09,883
You must be very good at judo then.

834
00:48:09,982 --> 00:48:12,552
Goodness. Come on.

835
00:48:12,553 --> 00:48:14,862
If he was good at judo, he would have had...

836
00:48:14,863 --> 00:48:17,692
a judo gym franchise business all over Korea by now.

837
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:20,033
But he's running another business.

838
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:22,163
Gosh!

839
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:26,372
Right! Judo!

840
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:29,343
Aren't you Jung Hyung Sik who competed in the Athens Olympics?

841
00:48:30,002 --> 00:48:31,372
Yes, I am.

842
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:35,082
I knew it. You looked so familiar.

843
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,683
I was a kid when I saw your game and cried.

844
00:48:37,783 --> 00:48:40,251
You were injured in the semi-final, so you had bandages around you.

845
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:41,722
And you had to go up against a Japanese athlete in the finals.

846
00:48:41,723 --> 00:48:44,092
You were losing, but you knocked him over at the end,

847
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:45,953
- didn't you? - Right. I did.

848
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:47,222
You still remember that.

849
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,592
Of course. The whole country remembers that.

850
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,763
You cried when you got the gold medal on the podium.

851
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:53,692
That was a long time ago.

852
00:48:54,863 --> 00:48:56,262
- You know him, don't you? - Yes?

853
00:48:56,263 --> 00:48:58,372
That's Jung Hyung Sik! My goodness.

854
00:48:59,073 --> 00:49:00,541
Calm down. Have some meat.

855
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,473
No way. I'm so glad I came here today.

856
00:49:02,643 --> 00:49:04,613
Can I get your autograph later?

857
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:07,512
I really thought you and I were dating in the beginning.

858
00:49:07,513 --> 00:49:09,013
Your acting was superb at first.

859
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:11,352
What was that toward the end?

860
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:12,782
I don't know.

861
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,122
I said everything you wanted me to say.

862
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,553
So you'll switch your schedule with me next week, right?

863
00:49:17,723 --> 00:49:18,993
No takebacks.

864
00:49:23,323 --> 00:49:26,093
Seriously. Nothing is going my way.

865
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:31,703
I hate this.

866
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:39,541
My clients are really kindhearted.

867
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:40,743
You need to know that.

868
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:42,642
You should have asked for a settlement...

869
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:44,752
instead of suing us first.

870
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:46,053
Stop it.

871
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:50,283
No matter what they say, I know it's my fault.

872
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:53,191
I'll do the talking. You just be quiet.

873
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:54,263
Enough.

874
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,893
I've been looking back on my mistake...

875
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:04,102
and doing my very best not to repeat my mistake.

876
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,672
I hope you can find generosity in your heart and forgive me.

877
00:50:10,643 --> 00:50:11,843
I'm sorry.

878
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,112
- Yes, it is your fault. - Right.

879
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:17,283
So at first, I was devastated.

880
00:50:17,613 --> 00:50:21,351
And Raphael also lost his last chance of having a baby.

881
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,183
So imagine his despair as well.

882
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,953
But now,

883
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,363
I decided to have the baby.

884
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:34,831
It wasn't what I planned,

885
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:37,102
but it doesn't mean it's the absolute worst.

886
00:50:38,232 --> 00:50:41,042
To me and Raphael,

887
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:43,172
this baby is precious.

888
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,372
So we won't take it to court.

889
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:48,582
After hearing...

890
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,812
your sincere apology,

891
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:55,122
I don't feel burdened anymore.

892
00:50:57,652 --> 00:50:58,953
Thank you.

893
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,413
- Good work. - Good work.

894
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:21,842
I knew you had it in you, Director Lee.

895
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:24,851
I have never seen such great numbers this fast.

896
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:26,912
Thank you for believing in me.

897
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:29,482
I'll work harder now.

898
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:31,691
You see why I promoted her, right?

899
00:51:31,692 --> 00:51:34,223
- I'll get going. - Sit down.

900
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,191
Ma Ri, you can go now.

901
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:37,663
Okay.

902
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,073
Dad.

903
00:51:44,332 --> 00:51:46,231
Don't compliment Ma Ri more than you have to...

904
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:47,442
in front of our employees.

905
00:51:47,502 --> 00:51:49,742
They all know we got a divorce. They might think it's odd.

906
00:51:49,743 --> 00:51:51,312
The divorce hasn't been finalized.

907
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:53,413
I said no to that.

908
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:56,413
Is getting an investment that important to you?

909
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:58,481
Why are you trading that with my marriage?

910
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,982
You think it's just for one investment?

911
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:03,482
I'm a great judge of character.

912
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:05,952
You won't find anyone kinder than Ma Ri.

913
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:08,921
I don't like her! It's over!

914
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:11,892
I want to divorce her. Why are you stopping me?

915
00:52:11,893 --> 00:52:13,331
I said no!

916
00:52:13,332 --> 00:52:15,933
You'd better not go through with it. The moment you do it, you're...

917
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:17,973
Come on. What's gotten into you?

918
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:19,232
Excuse me.

919
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:24,013
I'm sorry to overhear your conversation.

920
00:52:25,113 --> 00:52:26,212
Ms. Oh.

921
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:37,823
I have no intention of giving my baby to Ms. Lee.

922
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,893
I can't give you the baby unless he divorces her.

923
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,223
You can't?

924
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,231
Why are you changing your word?

925
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:47,802
I can't let a woman who cheats on her husband and lies...

926
00:52:47,803 --> 00:52:49,502
raise my baby.

927
00:52:49,902 --> 00:52:52,002
I'm only giving you the baby because I trust Raphael.

928
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:56,172
But how come you can't trust your own son?

929
00:52:57,102 --> 00:53:00,513
You should accept his decision and believe in him too.

930
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:13,823
Dad, we should go.

931
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:15,962
She must be early for the next meeting here.

932
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:17,732
Ms. Oh, have a nice meeting.

933
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:19,292
Let's go.

934
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:25,033
- Have a good meeting. - She will.

935
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:38,183
Woo Ri.

936
00:53:41,223 --> 00:53:42,522
Are you coming back from work?

937
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:48,792
Please.

938
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:51,363
We should at least say hello to each other.

939
00:53:52,093 --> 00:53:53,962
We will run into each other...

940
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,102
at church and in our neighborhood.

941
00:53:57,933 --> 00:53:59,772
I thought I had to be next to you...

942
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:02,372
for your happiness.

943
00:54:04,243 --> 00:54:05,613
But not anymore.

944
00:54:11,312 --> 00:54:12,883
When people wished...

945
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,622
each other's happiness during breakups in dramas,

946
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:20,152
I thought they didn't mean that. But I was wrong.

947
00:54:20,993 --> 00:54:22,823
To someone you deeply care about,

948
00:54:23,863 --> 00:54:25,462
you would say that.

949
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:32,372
Woo Ri.

950
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:38,712
Be happy.

951
00:54:40,442 --> 00:54:41,683
I hope you're happy.

952
00:54:57,192 --> 00:54:58,263
Thank you.

953
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:02,002
You be happy too.

954
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:05,902
Goodbye.

955
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:56,553
No! I really saw him with my two eyes!

(Trustworthy Police, Safe Country)

957
00:55:59,252 --> 00:56:02,292
Hey. Did you hear?

958
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:19,172
Then please proceed accordingly.

959
00:56:58,212 --> 00:56:59,283
Well,

960
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:01,652
sir.

961
00:57:02,223 --> 00:57:04,892
Gosh. You don't have to thank me.

962
00:57:04,893 --> 00:57:06,252
I can drop you off on my way.

963
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,223
No, it's not about that.

964
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:12,462
I've been going through a rough time lately.

965
00:57:12,593 --> 00:57:15,033
But thanks to you, I was able to overcome it.

966
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:17,363
Thank you.

967
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,732
Gosh. No. I didn't do anything.

968
00:57:21,073 --> 00:57:22,942
I'm glad you overcame it.

969
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,163
What?

970
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,402
Gosh. What did I just dream?

971
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:02,542
Gosh!

I'm the mother.

975
00:59:31,473 --> 00:59:32,731
You need to get a divorce.

976
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:34,232
What did you talk about?

977
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:36,171
Sir. Are you crying?

978
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,441
I keep getting butterflies whenever I see your mother.

979
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:39,742
But I shouldn't like her, right?

980
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,212
But why shouldn't I? Why not?

981
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:42,981
Then this is where went?

982
00:59:42,982 --> 00:59:45,151
- You really had no idea about this? - No.

983
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,883
I don't want anyone talking about it.

984
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:49,122
What is this ruckus?

985
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:52,121
I was really scared that I might end up...

986

falling for him.
