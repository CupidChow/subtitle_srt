- Date me! - Date me, please!

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,879
- Here... - Hey.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,108
Put that ring away. I brought one too.

13
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,449
Should I take it out now?

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,219
We were talking. Must you barge in like this?

15
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,849
Have some manners.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,388
Did you really have to drag her out in the middle of eating?

17
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,520
Gosh, stop!

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,328
What are you two doing right now?

19
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,359
What's happening in the middle of dinner?

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,600
Kang Jae, why did you run out in the middle of dinner?

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,230
He said he wanted to talk to Woo Ri.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,068
Raphael, you should've waited.

23
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,000
What were you thinking, following them out?

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,338
Mom, Grandma.

25
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:12,668
No, stop.

26
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:14,440
Calm down. It's okay.

27
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,410
This is all a sign that great things are ahead of us.

28
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,919
Mother, Eun Ran.

29
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:22,919
That's enough.

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,419
Raphael, Detective Lee.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,459
Drop it, okay?

32
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,890
Yes. Sorry for causing a commotion.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,929
You're the father of the baby.

34
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,339
We'll make the right decision for the sake of the baby.

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,599
You truly love my granddaughter, right?

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,839
Of course. Even in the past, I always loved her.

37
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,610
I'm even more sure of it now that we've spent some time apart.

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,678
My feelings for her have never once changed.

39
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,780
Okay, good. I'm on your side.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,019
I'll give you all the support you need.

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,190
Thank you. Seeing how much you trust me...

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,189
makes me feel so supported.

43
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,559
Let's make sure that our team wins no matter what.

44
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,559
- Okay? - Yes.

45
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,389
With your coaching and guidance,

46
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,229
I'll be sure to win.

47
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,169
I trust that you'll win.

48
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,199
How about a cheer to lift our spirits?

49
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:14,869
In 1, 2, 3.

50
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,969
- We got this! - We got this!

51
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,470
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

52
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,138
Mom, Grandma! Get back inside already.

53
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,340
Okay, I'm coming.

54
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,079
- You got this! - Thank you.

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,680
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

56
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,750
- Mom, seriously! - I'm going back inside.

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,060
Woo Ri, congratulations on becoming the main writer of the drama.

58
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,100
Congratulations.

59
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,319
Which man should Ji Dok Sa choose?

60
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,150
Chun Sa Da? Na Beom In?

61
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,090
Who should she choose?

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,759
The beginning of that dilemma.

63
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,500
The very first scene!

64
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,139
Hey, Kang Jae.

65
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,840
I stopped by hoping we could have a quick chat.

66
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,180
Are you busy right now?

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,019
Do you want a cup of tea?

68
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,380
No, I'll be leaving in a minute.

69
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,660
Well... Woo Ri.

70
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,829
I'm sorry about yesterday.

71
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,729
For showing up for the dinner without even telling you.

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,130
No, it's fine.

73
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,199
Woo Ri.

74
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,169
I did a lot of thinking while spending some time apart from you.

75
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,539
You know, the things you said to me when you broke up with me.

76
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,180
Looking back now,

77
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,710
I realize that you didn't really mean those words.

78
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,250
You just didn't want to put that burden on me.

79
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,620
Kang Jae.

80
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,120
At the time, I thought you were better off without me.

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,989
And I've realized that I was wrong.

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,030
I want to...

83
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,439
start over with you.

84
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,309
But I'm...

85
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,710
- The thing is... - Hey.

86
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,910
I don't expect you to give me your answer right now.

87
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,979
Think about it and let me know.

88
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,749
Congratulations on becoming the main writer.

89
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,489
Finally, you're one step closer to making your dream come true.

90
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,629
Bye, I'm off.

91
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,350
Raphael, what brings you by?

92
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,220
Did you not run into anyone you know?

93
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,660
What? Who?

94
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,358
You must be busy.

95
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,100
Don't offer me coffee. I'm good.

96
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,070
Oh, okay.

97
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,570
I thought long and hard...

98
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,970
and went to the dinner last night because I wanted to talk,

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,579
but I never got to say what I wanted to say...

100
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,879
and ended up causing trouble.

101
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,849
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,379
No, don't be.

103
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm sorry, Woo Ri.

104
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,419
I was rushing to get married.

105
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,460
Because of that, we broke up.

106
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,460
For that, I apologize.

107
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:00,159
I'll never ignore your opinion...

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,900
and push ahead with what I want to do.

109
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,999
I've pledged myself to it.

110
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,100
So...

111
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,010
let's get back together.

112
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,439
- Well, that's... - Right, I get it.

113
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,049
I won't rush you.

114
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,878
I'll give you plenty of time to think...

115
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,379
and wait until you decide.

116
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,789
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

117
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,960
I know the face you make when you're hungry.

118
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,700
What?

119
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,249
Ms. Yu.

120
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:02,119
Ms. Yu, are you all right?

121
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,460
Hey.

122
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,589
Why are you here?

123
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,590
Aren't you busy? You have to work on the script.

124
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,460
I know, I should.

125
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,530
But I feel stuck.

126
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:16,600
Hey. I can't type right now, but I can still talk.

127
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,840
Which part? Where are you stuck?

128
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,368
The part where Chun Sa Da and Na Beom In...

129
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:22,840
are trying to impress Ji Dok Sa.

130
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,749
I'm having trouble coming up with the details.

131
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,850
Hey, you can just hash it out based on your experience.

132
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,918
Based on my experience?

133
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,419
What's the difference between Kang Jae and Raphael?

134
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,220
- The difference? - Kang Jae is...

135
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:38,829
always there for you.

136
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,929
He's the loyal, faithful type who is always sweet to you.

137
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,359
Use him as a model for Chun Sa Da.

138
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,200
On the other hand, Raphael is very charming.

139
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:48,298
And he knows exactly what the ladies want.

140
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,700
Use him as a model for Na Beom In. Then you're set!

141
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,340
How easy is that?

142
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,409
I get the idea.

143
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,239
Now, you're good, right? Then go work on the script.

144
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,809
Ms. Yu.

145
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,189
I can't focus because I have too much on my mind.

146
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:07,989
Why? What's wrong?

147
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,619
Is it because of Raphael? What's going on?

148
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,830
He took care of the reason we broke up.

149
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,100
He wants to start over.

150
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,029
Good. Just get back together with him. What's the problem?

151
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,900
The problem is that Kang Jae also took care of the reason we broke up,

152
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,969
and he wants to start over.

153
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,509
What the fudge...

154
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,539
Hey, what is this?

155
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,010
Hey, this is like those crazy soap operas, but in real life.

156
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,720
So you're torn because you can't choose?

157
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,849
No, never mind.

158
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,119
There's a thing called priority, you know?

159
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,060
I'll focus on finishing the script first.

160
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,189
I'll think about this problem later.

161
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,128
Hey, those two men must be devastated right now.

162
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,700
This is about your future. You can't prioritize work over this.

163
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,430
You must decide as soon as possible...

164
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:56,700
Ms. Yu, are you all right?

165
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,369
Decide soon,

166
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,180
or things will get even worse.

167
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,629
Kang Jae is always there for you.

168
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,060
He's the loyal, faithful type who is always sweet to you.

169
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:25,970
Use him as a model for Chun Sa Da.

170
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,609
The things Kang Jae did for me when we were together...

171
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,210
Eun Ran, I told you to check the temperature of the oil.

172
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,310
This will burn the batter while leaving the meat undercooked.

173
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,310
I'm trying to make cheese cutlets.

174
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,149
Our customers won't like that.

175
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,920
Now that it has a new owner, the menu should change too.

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,090
Mom, how about I start a karaoke lounge here?

177
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,858
A karaoke lounge run by a singing instructor.

178
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,720
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

179
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,060
Hey, seriously!

180
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,329
Hey, Eun Ran. Mother!

181
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,729
Actor Choi! Come on in.

182
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,398
You said you wanted to talk to me.

183
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,028
That's right. It's about Woo Ri and the father of the baby.

184
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,170
Let's help them so they can work things out.

185
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,238
Mom, they broke up.

186
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,540
She should get back together with Kang Jae.

187
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,478
Well, that's something she should decide.

188
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,949
I don't think we can meddle in her decision.

189
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,618
Come on, Actor Choi. What's gotten into you?

190
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,748
Her future depends on this decision,

191
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,319
so we must make sure she makes a wise choice.

192
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,419
I've only met Detective Lee a few times,

193
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,559
so I barely had a chance to speak with him.

194
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
But I've met Raphael a bunch of times.

195
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,528
He's a really good guy.

196
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,358
Right? So you're taking our side, aren't you?

197
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,029
That I'm not sure about.

198
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,440
Hey, you said you were starting some kind of detective movie.

199
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,399
That's right. The filming will begin soon.

200
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,368
Perfect. Kang Jae is a homicide detective, you know.

201
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,279
You can interview him and his colleagues.

202
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,508
It'll be very helpful.

203
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,248
- I'll let him know. - I'd really appreciate that.

204
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,349
You see, Kang Jae is such a wonderful guy.

205
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,479
Such a faithful, patient man is hard to come by these days.

206
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,850
That's why he and Woo Ri make such a perfect couple.

207
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:29,619
Raphael isn't right for her. You understand, right?

208
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:35,330
Well, I'm busy. I have to go.

209
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,200
Wait, Actor Choi!

210
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,570
Gosh.

211
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,220
On the other hand, Raphael is very charming.

212
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,519
And he knows exactly what the ladies want.

213
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,930
Use him as a model for Na Beom In.

214
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,229
The things that Raphael and I did together.

215
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:15,269
My gosh, I thought...

216
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay. Detective Lee, I want to get to know you better...

217
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,129
so Woo Ri can open up to me.

218
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,540
I think she's still uncomfortable around me.

219
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,369
She still calls me "Mr. Choi".

220
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,409
She never calls me Dad.

221
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,050
Well, it takes her a while to open up to people.

222
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,820
But once she does, you're in her life forever. So don't worry.

223
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:08,019
I'll help you so you and Woo Ri can get closer soon.

224
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,190
Don't you worry!

225
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,689
Detective Lee, I know that I can totally count on you.

226
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,359
Maybe I should help you too, so you and Woo Ri...

227
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,728
can get back together.

228
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:19,929
I'd love that.

229
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,969
Oh, my. Have you been working out?

230
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,139
- Just a little. - Nice. Look at this.

(Diamond)

232
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,979
I can make you...

233
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,680
the chairwoman of the Diamond Medical Foundation.

234
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:40,320
What do you mean?

235
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,419
My initial plan was to make the hospital mine...

236
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,190
and take the position myself once Kim Duk Bae died,

237
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,659
but my plan has been ruined.

238
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,930
Everyone knows that I'm Chairman Kim now,

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
so I need a puppet.

240
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,970
And I like you.

241
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,738
Me?

242
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,878
You wanted to con them into giving you a building,

243
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,210
but it's all been ruined.

244
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,049
A random woman got pregnant and stole your husband from you.

245
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,379
You must be fuming mad.

246
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,989
You know everything.

247
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,590
But how are we going to take the hospital from them?

00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,659
You're here.

260
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,700
I wanted to see you before I left.

261

Where are you going? Are you off to the gym?

262

I'm friends with the monk in Mount Jiri, you know.

263
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,170
I'll help out at the temple and stay there for the time being.

264
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,450
This is all I need to live.

265
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,619
I don't know why I was trying to clench onto all those things.

266
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:22,258
What is this about? What has gotten into you?

267
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,859
I did not want to surrender to the monster called poverty,

268
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,590
so I fought all my life...

269
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,859
only to realize that I was a monster.

270
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,970
Bok Rae.

271
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,868
I told you to only use your English name, Raphael,

272
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,139
so people in Gangnam wouldn't look down on you.

273
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,479
You see, it's all useless.

274
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,810
Seriously, what's with you?

275
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,349
Did getting kidnapped and almost dying...

276
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,249
teach you how futile life really is?

277
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,790
I know you'll come back soon, so don't overreact.

278
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,930
And I really wanted to be the one telling you this.

279
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,999
Ms. Im. I mean, Hyun Sook.

280
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:14,440
She's your sister.

281
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,210
- What? - Your mother had her...

282
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,450
before she married me.

283
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,518
When she married me,

284
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,320
I abandoned her.

285
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,090
I did such horrible things.

286
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,700
I come from nothing.

287
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,570
To build this huge hospital in Gangnam,

288
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,769
I practically did everything except for murder.

289
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,269
In that process, she became a criminal...

290
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,739
and killed people to get back at me.

291
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,710
I wouldn't care if she were only after me,

292
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,450
but I even put you and your child's mother in danger.

293
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,129
My sins became a knife pointed at me.

294
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:17,439
Do not forgive me, ever.

295
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,359
Oh, Raphael.

296
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,358
Are you done for the day?

297
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,230
Yes. Why didn't you call me?

298
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,439
I didn't want to interrupt you while working, so I just waited here.

299
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,540
I see. Did something happen?

300
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:56,780
No, I just wanted to see you.

301
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,609
When I see you, I get to see Bok Dol too.

302
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:03,820
I wanted to see my family.

303
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,850
I see.

304
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,760
My father left today.

305
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,560
He feels that he's lived his life wrong.

306
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,800
I couldn't even stop him...

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,800
because everything he said was right.

308
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,899
Raphael.

309
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,169
I told myself once again...

310
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:30,679
that I will make sure my family is always happier than anyone else.

311
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:34,250
You and our child, Bok Dol...

312
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,580
Woo Ri!

313
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,219
What? Kang Jae.

314
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:43,959
Sorry, but we're talking right now.

315
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,290
Can we talk too?

316
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,699
Woo Ri, your father came to see me. We had a long conversation.

317
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,969
I know you the best.

318
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,070
- I can help you... - Hold on. Wait.

319
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,139
This is awfully rude.

320
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,909
Woo Ri, come here.

321
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,379
- What? - Hey.

322
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,609
Woo Ri, come here.

323
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,649
No. Come here, Woo Ri.

324
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,019
Let go. You too.

325
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,580
I can't. Hey, you let go of her hand.

326
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,218
You're hurting Woo Ri. Let go at once.

327
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,290
- Hold on. - Hey!

328
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,688
Let go, both of you. What are you doing?

329
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,259
- Are you playing tug-of-war? - You're hurting her. Let go.

330
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,789
She's telling you to let go.

331
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,188
You let go.

332
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:24,198
- Stop pulling. - It hurts!

333
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,069
I'll count to three. You'd better let go.

334
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,600
Or I'll get really angry.

335
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,740
One, two, three!

336
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,570
- No! - Hey, Woo Ri!

337
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,850
- Are you all right? - What are you two doing?

338
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,149
Hey, Woo Ri.

339
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,290
Woo Ri, tell us now.

340
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,820
You'll choose me, right?

341
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,429
It's me, right? Please say so.

342
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,310
Stop it!

343
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,510
Between the both of you...

344
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,379
Between the both of you...

345
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,119
I don't like both of you equally!

346
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,469
I'm home.

347
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,699
Good, you're home.

348
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,409
- What's going on? - Woo Ri.

349
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,909
I'm suffering between your mom and your grandmother.

350
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,619
This is exhausting.

351
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,719
- What? Why? - Well...

352
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,918
Say something! Whatever.

353
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,289
Since she's here in person, why don't you ask her directly?

354
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,989
- Go ahead, ask her. - Gosh.

355
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,389
Actor Choi, why are you being this way? Relax.

356
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,688
What is it?

357
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,958
Your mom is on Kang Jae's side,

358
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,769
and your grandmother is on Raphael's side.

359
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,529
And they want me to choose a side.

360
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,069
But what good would it do for me to choose a side?

361
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,168
It's your opinion that matters the most.

362
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,770
Why are you all heated up?

363
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:16,178
I'm not heated up.

364
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,780
But you keep on telling me what to do.

365
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,379
Woo Ri, since you're here. Tell us your decision.

366
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,480
Woo Ri, who is it?

367
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,649
Is it Raphael or Kang Jae?

368
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,958
- I... - Yes?

369
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,990
Yes?

370
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,429
Between Kang Jae and Raphael...

371
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,159
- Yes? - Yes?

372
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,399
I like them both equally.

373
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,139
- Gosh. - Gosh.

374
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,139
Gosh.

375
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,209
That's why I can't tell you.

376
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,649
What do I do?

377
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,550
This is a difficult matter...

378
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,149
for us.

379
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,320
But it's a difficult matter for Woo Ri as well.

380
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,699
Right. Let's think about this matter slowly.

381
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,629
Right. That's right.

382
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:17,168
This is not something for you to decide hastily.

383
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,369
We are talking about my granddaughter's life.

384
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,679
I'll be on your side whatever decision you make.

385
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,010
Thank you, Grandma.

386
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,719
Let me give you a hug.

387
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,389
But... A decision...

388
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,899
Gosh, this is more difficult than it looks.

389
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,169
Mother did this every day?

390
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:51,968
That's what I'm saying.

391
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,439
This doesn't even make that much profit either.

392
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,368
The moment you wake up, you start the business.

393
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,079
Then after lunch and dinner,

394
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,638
you close up and fall asleep.

395
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,379
You're a slave, a slave to pork cutlets.

396
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,419
Really, this...

397
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,719
This must have been difficult for Mother.

398
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,419
Maybe she's not as tactful.

399
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,090
By the way, I'm thinking about changing the business to karaoke.

400
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,829
Wait, but this is not the right spot for karaoke.

401
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,759
All you need to do is change the mic covers at karaoke.

402
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,000
There is no work involved in it.

403
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,599
That is correct.

404
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,668
But Mother worked on this her whole life...

405
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,698
under the name "Seo Gwi Nyeo".

406
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,510
- And changing it like that... - Welcome.

407
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:27,939
Hello.

408
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,280
Are you pregnant?

409
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,740
My daughter is pregnant as well.

410
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,010
How far are you in your pregnancy?

411
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,179
I'm due next month.

412
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,948
I'd like a Seo Gwi Nyeo pork cutlet, please.

413
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,790
- Yes, please wait. - Excuse me.

414
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,888
Did the owner change?

415
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,260
No, I'm the daughter. Please wait.

416
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,859
I'm back.

417
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,869
Ms. Seo, hello.

418
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,139
Oh, hello.

419
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,069
Ms. Seo,

420
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,809
you may not remember me.

421
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,409
It's been a while since I came here.

422
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,780
Right. Who are you again?

423
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,020
I graduated Bukgajwa Girls' Middle School 15 years ago.

424
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,849
I used to come and eat your pork cutlet...

425
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,619
at least once a week.

426
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,989
Didn't you wear glasses back then?

427
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,330
A round pair.

428
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:21,859
Yes, that's right.

429
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,729
Do you remember me now?

430
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,858
Yes, I do.

431
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,070
You still have that face.

432
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,439
Why?

433
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,280
What's wrong?

434
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,780
It's nothing.

435
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,980
I'm pregnant,

436
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:44,250
and I came because I craved this pork cutlet.

437
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,949
It was like only yesterday, having pork cutlets here.

438
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,290
But now that I am pregnant and have become a mother,

439
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,699
it feels like time passes so fast.

440
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,639
Thank you, Ms. Seo.

441
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,600
What are you grateful for?

442
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,939
For having this place still open.

443
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,909
Thank you so much.

444
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,509
Among all the food I ate during my pregnancy,

445
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,020
this pork cutlet is the best.

446
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,149
It still tastes the same.

447
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,050
It's so delicious.

448
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,189
I should thank you more.

449
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,659
Help yourself.

450
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,500
What is it?

451
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,139
Tell me.

452
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,000
What's keeping you?

453
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,179
I know...

454
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,449
that you like me slightly.

455
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
What are you talking about?

456
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,590
Are you a narcissist or something?

457
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:04,500
I know that you like me as your senior detective.

458
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:07,129
What is it?

459
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:10,399
What's with the mood? What do you want to talk about?

460
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,369
Na Hee,

461
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,209
there's something big,

462
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,209
and you're the only person I can tell it to.

463
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,679
Something big? What is it?

464
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,449
You know...

465
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,149
our captain.

466
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,730
Gosh, the timing.

467
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,800
Let's talk after you answer the phone.

468
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,169
Yes? What is it, Raphael?

469
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:00,149
Did you bring the file?

470
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,858
Yes.

471
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,320
This is a list of all the secret funds.

472
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,689
Let my Mom go before I hand this over.

473
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,159
You'll be in trouble...

474
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:15,230
if you play games with me.

475
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,899
I'm a scary person.

476
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,909
You said you wanted to work with me.

477
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,439
If you don't trust me, how can we work together?

478
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,949
Do you think it's right for my mom to be tied up like that for months?

479
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm...

480
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,619
fine.

481
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,618
I think I'm getting used to this.

482
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:35,148
- I'm able to sleep well... - Can't you trust me?

483
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,819
Then you shouldn't ask me to do things for you.

484
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,459
I did everything that you wanted.

485
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,030
Let go of my mom.

486
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,459
Let go of my mom.

487
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,070
That is so sad.

488
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,169
Here.

489
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,780
- Mom, are you okay? - Get me out of these.

490
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,020
Slowly. It hurts.

491
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,290
You suffered so much.

492
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,648
I'll release you.

493
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,419
Don't pull, Ma Ri.

494
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,459
(New storage device is connected.)

495
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:23,698
Ma Ri, you!

496
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:24,899
Stop! Don't move!

497
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,909
Drop the knife. Drop it!

498
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:30,378
Put your hands over your head.

499
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,540
Drop it.

500
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,310
Drop it.

501
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,780
Get her.

502
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,989
You're under arrest for violating the narcotics control act,

503
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,560
the Medical Service Exception Act,

504
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,158
and for the murder of...

505
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,590
Shin Mi Young, No Man Chul, Lee Jong Gu,

506
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,699
and...

507
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,600
Sergeant Kim Jun Hyuk.

508
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,240
I heard...

509
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,080
that you were my sister.

510
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,209
My sister.

511
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,750
Don't be ridiculous.

512
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,319
I should have stabbed Kim Duk Bae...

513
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,919
and killed everyone with my hands.

514
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,990
Even you and your baby.

515
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:51,060
I know that my dad was wrong.

516
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,560
But I'm sure you had other choices that you could've made.

517
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,369
What do you know about me?

518
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,840
This was the easiest for me.

519
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,240
Being this way.

520
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:43,139
What are you saying? You should really stop.

521
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,510
Lee Ma Ri can only say the same thing.

522
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,520
"I'll do better, please give me another chance".

523
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,889
That's all she can say.

524
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:03,830
I'm tired of being Lee Ma Ri.

525
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,300
I'm not Lee Ma Ri.

526
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,469
My name is...

527
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,240
Lee Mal Ja.

528
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,310
What is this?

529
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:26,090
Is this another plan of yours?

530
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,149
I mean it.

531
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,020
Yes, I approached you for your money.

532
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:35,730
I conned you into marriage saying that I was pregnant,

533
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,570
and I stuck by because I wanted to take something from you.

534
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,570
That's who I am.

535
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,569
- You... - My mom is not in Europe...

536
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,580
but lives here with me.

537
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,709
My mom...

538
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,050
was a convicted fraud.

539
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,149
And because we kept on lying like that...

540
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,619
Somehow...

541
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,659
Chairman Kim had my mom holding her hostage.

542
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,030
What?

543
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:35,719
- Let's go. - Mr. Choi. What's this article?

544
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,359
Are you appearing in a detective movie?

545
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:39,319
The article's out already?

546
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,358
I was going to tell you first.

547
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,458
You know how we're behind with our shooting.

548
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,330
You can't appear in other movies.

549
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,770
It's decided that both schedules will be taken care of.

550
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,168
Mr. Kim!

551
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,240
You can't. You just can't.

552
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,679
- Mr. Kim! - Even if Mr. Kim comes, you can't.

553
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,520
That's embarrassing.

554
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,980
Can't you be in both the drama and the movie?

555
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,689
Of course, you can.

556
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,020
They only need to compromise.

557
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,689
But they are fighting for their pride.

558
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,759
- Darn it. - Gosh, be gentle.

559
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,570
You're going to ruin the meat.

560
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,638
Are you okay? What's wrong?

561
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,269
This isn't good. It should turn together.

562
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,608
- Can't you turn your arm? - No.

563
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,479
My head can but the rest won't.

564
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,550
- I'm home. - You're home.

565
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,718
- Can you call 911? - What?

566
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:40,689
- My arm should turn like this. - It's weird.

567
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,820
But this one won't.

568
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,990
Gosh, your arm must be dislocated.

569
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,030
But I have a shooting tomorrow.

570
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,199
Ms. Oh, can you change the script so that Chun Sa Da dies, right?

571
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,830
If you change this one thing from last time, he dies.

572
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,600
Get rid of him and have Ji Dok Sa and Na Beom In's confrontation.

573
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:01,369
- Well... - What do you mean?

574
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,040
Why are you firing me?

575
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,608
Why should Chun Sa Da die?

576
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,009
You complicated our schedule with overlapping appearances.

577
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,249
And now, you have a dislocated arm.

578
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,718
We can no longer tolerate power trips from actors.

579
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,548
You can just go with the arm injured.

580
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:16,689
And besides, you can't just kill people off like that.

581
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,019
You might murder everyone out of habit.

582
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,489
Mr. Choi. I'm trying to be considerate here.

583
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:25,059
Shall I sue you for disrupting our schedule? Shall I?

584
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,899
Sue me. I'll sue back. For murder.

585
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,698
I'll send you to the central district prosecutor's office...

586
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,469
for murder.

587
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,569
Ms. Oh, bring a new storyline where Chun Sa Da dies.

588
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:37,908
Ms. Oh, let's just go with the injured arm.

589
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,679
- I love you. Okay? - Well...

590
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:42,710
What's all this about?

591
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,250
Then, do you have to throw away everything you've done so far?

592
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,350
Yes.

593
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,119
I need to write it again in two days.

594
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:52,960
I need to work like crazy.

595
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,299
I need to write Chun Sa Da's death, which we haven't thought of before.

596
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,869
There's nothing we can do.

597
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,170
Start on it right away.

598
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,540
I feel bad for you.

599
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,710
(End of Episode 120.)

600
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,360
Let's go. Why are you dawdling?

601
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,560
Mal Ja.

602
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,509
You aren't answering my calls.

603
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,639
Are you running away like this?

604
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,250
I went in for questioning at the police station.

605
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,279
They told me there was no charge for colluding with Chairman Kim.

606
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,819
And for deceiving you,

607
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,588
you need to sue me for that.

608
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:57,989
You can sue me if you want to.

609
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:01,659
I'm not going to.

610
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,900
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,069
I've done so much wrong that I can't even ask you to forgive me.

612
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:14,339
You've done something big.

613
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,610
You saved me...

614
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,040
and my dad.

615
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,880
I think I should thank you for that.

616
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,719
This is so complicated.

617
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,259
It's absurd, and it angers me.

618
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,929
I feel grateful as well.

619
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,130
But something I don't get...

620
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,239
is that you lied about studying abroad.

621
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,940
But why are you so good at your job?

622
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:53,909
Here, take this.

623
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,049
Consider this your alimony.

624
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,389
I approached you for money,

625
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,130
and I'm leaving with it.

626
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,029
I've done everything I need to.

627
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,839
Goodbye.

628
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,900
Bye Lee Ma Ri.

629
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,080
Mal Ja.

630
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:27,650
Goodbye.

631
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,650
Thank you,

632
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,190
Mr. Kim Bok Rae.

633
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:55,869
Everyone.

634
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,838
We've solved Chairman Kim's case.

635
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:00,879
- So, let's go home. - Yes, sir.

636
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,948
- Let's enjoy a life with evenings. - Yes, sir.

637
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,689
Let's go home. Turn it off.

638
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,850
- Bye. - Bye.

639
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,689
- You shouldn't have been caught. - Good job.

640
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,819
You're done for now.

641
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:16,259
What do you mean Captain Park?

642
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Aren't we on the same team?

643
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:22,170
I won't die alone.

644
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:28,940
If I let go of you,

645
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,839
don't you ever come back.

646
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,350
Wait.

647
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,219
Send me the million dollars that you promised right away.

648
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,589
Then, I'll set you free.

649
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,040
Yes. We caught her.

650
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,909
Would that bring Jun Hyuk back?

651
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,819
I found out about Jun Hyuk...

652
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,619
I found out you helped his wife from her.

653
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:18,190
I haven't spent a dime that I got from Chairman Kim.

654
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,190
I spent it all on buying his family an apartment unit.

655
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:23,830
Otherwise,

656
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,130
I'll be ashamed of seeing him later on.

657
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:31,540
Kang Jae,

658
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:34,540
let go of me.

659
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,080
I won't come back ever.

660
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:41,509
This is my last request.

661
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,520
Captain.

662
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,519
The just society that you want will never come true...

663
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,690
working as the police.

664
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,159
The small salary, a bad father...

665
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,960
And nothing we do eradicates crime.

666
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,529
We just get hurt or killed on the job.

667
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:00,929
Our best bet...

668
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,770
is to find a way to coexist with crime.

669
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,468
When you become my age,

670
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:08,409
you'll get what I mean.

671
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:11,409
Kang Jae.

672
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,650
Until the day I retire,

673
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:24,520
I don't want to get it.

674
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,529
Hey.

675
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,190
Woo Ri.

676
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,960
Woo Ri.

677
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,469
Not today.

678
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,770
I don't have the energy to fight.

679
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,968
That's not why I'm here.

680
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,670
I got to see you, and that's enough.

681
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,980
I'll go home, then.

682
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,199
Am I getting old?

683
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,670
I thought dating was the biggest problem in the world.

684
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:51,810
But there are way bigger problems in life.

685
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:56,009
You've been through a lot yourself.

686
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,150
Your life wasn't exactly easy either.

687
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,649
You know how to drink.

688
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,479
Beer isn't exactly liquor.

689
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,980
I can drink this forever.

690
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:34,389
What?

691
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,389
Are you a lightweight?

692
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,469
Are you all right? You look drunk.

693
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,839
Where was I?

694
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,710
Mother and Grandmother both.

695
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,610
They thought of me like a son.

696
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:08,088
I even know where they keep their screwdriver.

697
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,290
I even...

698
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,589
spent a few nights there.

699
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,060
I lived with them.

700
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,460
You haven't, have you?

701
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:19,500
I haven't.

702
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,600
Come on.

703
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,310
You had enough. Stop drinking.

704
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,509
You can't even hold it.

705
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:54,999
- You're so heavy. - I am...

706
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,868
Oh Woo Ri's...

707
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:58,838
Be quiet.

708
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,739
Shut your mouth before I ditch you.

709
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,839
Her first kiss... That was with me.

710
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,580
I was her first kiss.

711
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,949
You crossed the line.

712
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:12,949
Darn it.

713
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,489
He brought it upon himself.

714
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,960
Whatever.

715
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,790
You know,

716
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,560
the best person I met in my life...

717
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:29,429
is Woo Ri.

718
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,839
Even if she won't choose me.

719
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:36,509
the best person in the world has my baby.

720
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,509
I am...

721
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,779
grateful enough for that connection.

722
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,719
Taxi!

723
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,029
Shoot.

724
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,489
This is madness.

725
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:06,540
Oh, gosh.

726
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:09,009
No, Sa Da.

727
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,810
If there were a forever,

728
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:16,650
at...

729
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:19,549
the end,

730
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,250
That's it. Keep it going.

731
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:24,719
let's...

732
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,759
meet...

733
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,630
again.

734
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,468
No, wait.

735
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,298
You can't die!

736
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:39,799
- Cut. Okay! - Bravo!

737
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,239
That's a wrap!

738
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,279
- Awesome! - Well done.

739
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,949
Was that okay? Are you sure?

740
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:48,449
It wasn't just okay.

741
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,179
It was your best shot ever.

742
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,420
That was Choi Sung Il's final scene.

743
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,819
He did a great job up to the very end,

744
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,690
so let's give him some props!

745
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,560
- Thank you! - Good job!

746
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,060
Well done!

747
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,000
Goodness. What are you all doing here?

748
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:13,710
We're here as fans to celebrate your last shoot.

749
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,110
Thank you.

750
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,639
I laughed and cried with you for a few months.

751
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,349
I'm sad your character died,

752
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,219
but I can say for sure he was the best in the drama.

753
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,989
- You were great. - Thanks.

754
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,488
Well done.

755
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:32,488
I'll help you with the detective movie. Trust me.

756
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,830
Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

757
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,900
It could've been an embarrassing exit for me,

758
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,199
but our writer, Ms. Oh, sorted that all out.

759
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,670
You killed off my character,

760
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,110
but you saved me.

761
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:50,439
Thanks, Woo Ri.

762
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,979
You said you'd act whatever I wrote,

763
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,909
and your trust in me helped me create a great scene.

764
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,650
I should thank you, Dad.

765
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:10,330
What did you just say?

766
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,199
Dad.

767
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,299
Father?

768
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,440
Dad?

769
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:24,380
Woo Ri!

770
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,110
I feel like a dad now.

771
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,350
My gosh...

772
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,529
I'm so happy.

773
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,750
(The late Lee and Hahm)

774
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,449
Thanks for coming with me.

775
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,178
You're welcome.

776
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:41,290
It was good to see them again.

777
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,059
It's not a special day.

778
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,389
Why did you want to come here?

779
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,860
It is a special day.

780
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,730
What?

781
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,529
It's the anniversary of the first time...

782
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,869
my dad took me to a baseball game.

783
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,869
It's the day...

784
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,170
I first called him dad.

785
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,150
Woo Ri.

786
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,219
My dad was my stepdad.

787
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,819
My mom had remarried,

788
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,020
and I...

789
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,219
called him "mister" because "dad" felt weird.

790
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,830
But he waited until I opened up.

791
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,230
I was ten or so.

792
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:32,339
He took me to a baseball game for the first time.

793
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:35,940
I think it was a miracle.

794
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:39,380
He caught a foul ball.

795
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:44,020
I got overly excited and yelled...

796
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,319
and called him dad.

797
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,290
Ever since then on this day...

798
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,000
Dad called me, and we had our own dinner date.

799
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:09,770
My biological father's still alive.

800
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,040
What?

801
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:14,049
Your dad's alive?

802
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,710
No.

803
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:18,380
My dad's dead.

804
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,659
The man who reeked of alcohol and beat my mom is alive,

805
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,290
but the cool dad who made me what I am is dead.

806
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,230
This is my one and only dad.

807
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:41,569
That's why I'm confident...

808
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,239
I can raise your baby as my own.

809
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,850
I wondered about it for a long time,

810
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:51,549
but now I'm convinced.

811
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,790
Because to me, family...

812
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,060
Family, to me...

813
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,690
isn't about blood...

814
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:04,830
but the time spent together.

815
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,709
You're back.

816
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,579
- Yes. - I'm about to head off.

817
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,678
- Okay, bye. - Take care.

818
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,150
- Wait. - Yes?

819
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:23,810
Dad.

820
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
What is it?

821
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,420
- Thank you. - Just out of the blue?

822
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,460
For what?

823
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:34,429
For everything.

824
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:37,060
Are you just being silly?

825
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,229
Kang Jae said that being related doesn't...

826
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:44,400
automatically make you family, that you must work at it.

827
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,940
Thank you for putting in the effort to make up for lost time.

828
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,009
You tried hard to befriend me,

829
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,250
you're good to Grandma,

830
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,049
and you help Mom at work.

831
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,279
Thanks for everything.

832
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,960
You shouldn't have to thank family for that.

833
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:06,520
Plus,

834
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,659
I help your mom because I like her.

835
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,630
I know. I hope you two can work it out.

836
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,069
You really do?

837
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,309
I hit on your mom and got rejected.

838
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,040
Did you really?

839
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,079
I didn't know. I'm rooting for you.

840
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,049
Hearing you say that...

841
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,380
makes me feel good.

842
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,289
I'm feeling brave enough to propose to her again.

843
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,489
You'll propose?

844
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:39,218
I'm all for it, totally.

845
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:40,420
Let me help.

846
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,630
Yes, Dad. I got it.

847
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,028
I actually asked Mom in passing.

848
00:52:48,029 --> 00:52:50,029
Yes, go for that kind of proposal.

849
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,899
Sure, I can do that.

850
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,710
Grandma said she'd help.

851
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:55,969
Okay.

852
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,080
I'm rooting for you, Dad.

853
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,350
He's going to propose.

854
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,049
Wait.

855
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,920
I got proposed to twice.

856
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,900
Will you marry me?

857
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:27,170
Will you marry me?

858
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:45,059
You didn't even give me a warning.

859
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,889
We were in the neighbourhood.

860
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,360
Take your time. We're not hungry yet.

861
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,159
- Okay. - Ms. Oh.

862
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,560
My goodness.

863
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:56,829
- Welcome. How are you? - Hello.

864
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,198
Why the sudden visit?

865
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,068
Singing class is no fun without you.

866
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:03,670
We came to see you.

867
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:06,380
Take a seat. Sit over here.

868
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:10,880
- Goodness. Hello. - Hello.

869
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,649
Sorry... Hello. Mom's not in right now.

870
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,548
We're not here to see her.

871
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:18,419
What? Sit down first.

872
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,718
Do you want pork cutlet?

873
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:21,060
No. Just do your thing.

874
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,330
What's going on?

875
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:29,830
What? Those two came in together?

876
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,369
- Hello. - Hi.

877
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,469
You should turn on the TV.

878
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,839
What?

879
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:40,880
- I'm my daughter's father, - Oh? Sung Il's on.

880
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,750
but I'm not my daughter's mom's husband.

881
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,449
But now,

882
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:52,219
I want to be both a good father and a good husband.

883
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,029
So today, to my daughter's mother,

884
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,500
I wish to propose.

885
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,639
- What? - Are you serious?

886
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:08,969
Eun Ran.

887
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,810
We met 30 years ago already.

888
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
We were in middle school then,

889
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:18,880
and now we're middle-aged.

890
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:24,759
But to me, you still look like you're 16.

891
00:55:27,489 --> 00:55:30,489
Because throughout those 30 years.

892
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,460
I went on loving you.

893
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:38,900
Eun Ran.

894
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:42,839
Will you marry me?

895
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,080
Oh, my goodness.

896
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,718
It's him.

897
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,989
- Wow. - My gosh.

898
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,330
As Woo Ri's dad,

899
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,900
and as Eun Ran's husband,

900
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,069
I want to live a good life.

901
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:18,139
Will you let me?

902
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:37,429
Everyone else is dressed up, and I look a mess.

903
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:39,060
This isn't right.

904
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,269
Is it not?

905
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:46,069
Then do you want to get changed?

906
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:47,738
It's already done.

907
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:49,639
Oh, you're right.

908
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:53,080
Shall I do this another day?

909
00:56:57,819 --> 00:57:00,549
- Well done. - Congratulations.

910
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:04,190
Just a moment. I'll keep this ring,

911
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:08,330
but before I say yes to him, I must state a condition.

912
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:12,360
A condition? Okay, what is it? I'll do anything.

913
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,060
- Not you. - Okay.

914
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:19,139
- Woo Ri. - Yes?

915
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:22,239
You must go first. Make up your mind.

916
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,239
Me? Why?

917
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,980
Pick one or the other.

918
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:31,080
Woo Ri. Once you make up your mind,

919
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,520
I'll accept this proposal.

920
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,489
Duk Chil, are you okay with that?

921
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,889
What? Yes, of course, I am.

922
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,000
Actually, I already made up my mind.

923
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:56,569
You did? Who is it?

924
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,880
I've...

925
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,489
decided...

926
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,920
(Woori the Virgin)

927
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,988
Are you ready to marry now?

928
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,849
Whatever happens to me,

929
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,460
he's always there, by my side.

930
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,988
We won't have to meet anymore.

931
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:22,459
I'll see her, as her kid's dad.

932
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,599
- I'll see her, as a church friend. - Gosh.

933
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,799
Woo Ri. I thought I'd regret it if I didn't tell you.

934
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,599
- The groom's not here. - He was arrested.

935
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,769
What are you saying? I'll go and get him.

936
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,368
The bride can't leave.

937
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:37,940
Then what? I should get him. He's my husband.

938
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:40,310
I found my husband.

939
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,750
