(Woori the Virgin)

9
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,340
How could you say that to me? I'm the baby's father!

10
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:48,380
I can raise this baby well even if I have to do it by myself.

11
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,390
Is that you, Woo Ri? You're home late.

12
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,418
- I'm home. - Come inside and rest up.

13
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,059
What are you doing over there?

14
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,300
Mom.

15
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,300
Grandma.

16
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,369
Woo Ri. What's going on?

17
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,440
I felt lost before.

18
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,470
But now, I know I can do everything.

19
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,109
- What? - What? Do what?

20
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,449
You and Grandma helped me become that person.

21
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:55,119
I can handle everything the world throws at me...

22
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,589
just like you guys did.

23
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,819
Woo Ri. What are you talking about?

24
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,360
What?

25
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,900
(Episode 12)

26
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,739
(Writer Oh Woo Ri)

27
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,509
Hey.

28
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:31,019
What? The police did what to my dad?

29
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,919
You admit that it's you in the photo. Right?

30
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,460
Yes. I said that was me in the photo.

31
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,489
I went there to get some fresh air.

32
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,299
This is a free country.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,999
Is going for a drive after my meal a crime?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,969
Exactly. Why did you go there?

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,999
We have evidence!

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
How much longer will you play innocent?

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,970
Play innocent?

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,409
Seriously. I'm trying to be civil with you!

39
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,009
You guys are really crossing the line!

40
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,780
I wasn't going to bring this up because it would make me look petty.

41
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,120
The plant.

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,250
That plant over there you broke.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,660
Your salaries won't be enough to pay for that plant.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,359
But I generously let that go.

45
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,529
How dare you treat me like a murderer after my generosity?

46
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,130
Are you sure you can handle the consequence?

47
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:26,340
Kang Jae.

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,239
What? Hey.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,979
What are you doing there?

50
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,079
Don't touch my precious plants.

51
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,340
Hey, this is...

52
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,989
You didn't find the murder weapon at the scene?

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,729
But the stab wound on the neck matches Chairman Kim's MO.

54
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,770
Father.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,239
Dad.

56
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,668
I heard the police came by late at night.

57
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,010
What are you doing here?

58
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,080
They found the scalpel with the late doctor...

59
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,350
Lee Jong Gu's blood in his plant pot.

60
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,879
Lee Jong Gu?

61
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,220
The doctor at our hospital?

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
He's dead?

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,788
Dad. Did you...

64
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,729
Don't even ask me if I killed him.

65
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,030
I have a headache. Be quiet.

66
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,739
I want to be alone.

67
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,169
Tell Lawyer Jung to come already.

68
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,739
How much longer must I stay in here?

69
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,820
Captain, we found it in the seat of Lee Jong Gu's car.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,280
The evidence he was going to give to us.

71
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,988
What's this?

72
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:21,559
Chairman Kim was indeed giving makeovers to criminals.

73
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,289
The three of them were hired because they gambled at the parlor.

74
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,590
No Man Chul would bring in the criminals.

75
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:29,358
Shin Mi Young would get the drugs and facility from the hospital.

76
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,830
And Lee Jong Gu operated on them.

77
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,069
I bet he made a fortune.

78
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,099
But No Man Chul threatened Chairman Kim...

79
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,139
with the list of criminals who got plastic surgery.

80
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,409
And Chairman Kim used Shin Mi Young who had a lot of gambling debt...

81
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,038
to get rid of No Man Chul.

82
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,239
Then he tried to make it look like Shin Mi Young killed herself.

83
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,009
When Lee Jong Gu who saw everything...

84
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,509
tried to contact the police, Chairman Kim killed him.

85
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,549
And...

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,649
the person who could...

87
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,549
easily coordinate everything at the hospital...

88
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,150
was the chairman.

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,890
Hey, this is amazing! We caught Chairman Kim!

90
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,029
Hey. I'll go and get the warrant.

91
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,899
Let's raid Diamond Medical Foundation now...

92
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,059
and get all the evidence. Okay?

93
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,700
Good work.

94
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:11,808
What's wrong?

95
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:14,640
We finally caught Chairman Kim. Shouldn't you be happy?

96
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,010
The faceless drug king...

97
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,080
is Chairman Kim Duk Bae?

98
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,150
All the evidence is pointing to him.

99
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,559
Ms. Yu.

100
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,029
Well,

101
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,229
it might not be the perfect time to bring this up.

102
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,470
There's no such thing. Just tell me now.

103
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,999
- He proposed. - What?

104
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,210
Oh, no. Did you get piles again?

105
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:51,179
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay.

106
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,549
Go on. What did you say?

107
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,090
Well,

108
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,118
he didn't propose to me...

109
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,559
because he was certain I was the one for him.

110
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:06,030
So I said no.

111
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:09,859
Gosh. You kind of...

112
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,570
You've gotten strong.

113
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,799
So what did Raphael say to that?

114
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,039
Whatever.

115
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,340
We had an argument. And he hasn't called since then.

116
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,349
Hey, don't let your pride stand in the way.

117
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,949
Anyone can just make the call first.

118
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,650
Call him and discuss it calmly again.

119
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,359
The Raphael I know isn't that unreasonable.

120
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,829
(Writer Oh Woo Ri)

121
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,129
Sir.

122
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,438
You're the most popular doctor here.

123
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,668
And you've been with us since the beginning.

124
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,340
What do you mean you're resigning?

125
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,070
Please reconsider.

126
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,080
I'll get going.

127
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,010
Wait. Sir.

128
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,450
- Wait. - What brings you here?

129
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,820
Are you here to see me?

130
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,590
Ma'am. Hello. Please come in.

131
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,660
No. I'll see you next time.

132
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,169
(Police)

133
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,049
I trust that you're innocent.

134
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:35,719
The truth will come out.

135
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,389
Thanks. Only you're looking out for me.

136
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,019
Gosh.

137
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,159
My only son hasn't even come by to see me.

138
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,369
You startled me. Gosh.

139
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,379
You're here.

140
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,680
I want to talk to him in private.

141
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:10,220
You want me to leave too?

142
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,819
But I'm family.

143
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,690
You're not family. Get out.

144
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,129
Dad, the crimes that took place in the hospital.

145
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,399
You really have nothing to do with them?

146
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,739
Are you...

147
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,340
suspecting me?

148
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,809
You think I killed people?

149
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,080
The criminals...

150
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,920
have secretly been getting new faces at our hospital.

151
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,450
In that weird room.

152
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,950
This business generated a lot of profits.

153
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,489
But you had no idea about this?

154
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,658
You really think I did it?

155
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,229
Why did you go...

156
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,758
to the murder scene? You went there twice!

157
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,830
That...

158
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,769
I'll tell you later.

159
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,739
I'll tell you when the time is right.

160
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,379
Some people will know that I'm innocent.

161
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,279
I'm just sad that it's not you.

162
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,359
Dad.

163
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:28,159
If you are connected to these crimes in any way,

164
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,600
I...

165
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,999
I won't ever see you again.

166
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,470
And I'm trying to save the hospital.

167
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,710
So resign from your position.

168
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:54,350
I'll catch you myself and kill you.

169
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,190
Then it'll be all over.

170
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,359
Captain.

171
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,460
The chairman is probably faking his medical condition, right?

172
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,599
I can't let him get away with this cheap trick.

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,999
We can't let that happen.

174
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:09,970
Are you going somewhere?

175
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,609
To the hospital.

176
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,369
I need to get my meds.

177
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,879
I'll be back.

178
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,519
Lawyer Jung!

179
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,749
I pay you to do your job!

180
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,759
Who is he?

181
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,060
Who is this Chairman Kim guy?

182
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,729
Why did he try to frame me for the murder?

183
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,769
Why me?

184
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,670
I've been at this for days, but I still don't know.

185
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,210
My blood pressure is rising. Give me my meds.

186
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,590
Chairman Kim.

187
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,960
If the police can't catch him, I'll catch him.

188
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,399
I'll catch him and destroy him!

189
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,029
This jerk...

190
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,040
Why...

191
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,580
Why am I feeling...

192
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,810
Sir! Are you all right?

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,940
Hey! The chairman isn't here!

194
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,470
He disappeared.

195
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,739
My dad...

196
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,278
He looked into a boat to stow away.

197
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,508
If he flees now, that's a serious offense!

198
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:02,920
We must find him as soon as possible.

199
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,519
Any ideas on where he might be?

200
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,519
It's over.

201
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,850
What?

202
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,560
Why do you think he fled?

203
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,489
It's obvious.

204
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,629
Ms. Im!

205
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:49,859
Over here!

206
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,768
Who did this to me?

207
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:54,999
Untie me right now.

208
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,878
What are you doing?

209
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,440
Come on. Get me out of here.

210
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,249
Did you do this to me?

211
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,659
My necklace is gone.

212
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,859
I must have left it in the writer's studio.

213
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,060
Chairman Kim?

214
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,080
(Do what I say. Or you'll die.)

215
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:57,060
Cinderella lost her parents

216
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,170
At a young age

217
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,509
And she was bullied

218
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,379
By her stepmother and stepsisters

219
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,580
You...

220
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,819
It hurts

221
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,950
It hurts very much

222
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,220
- How long did she cry? - Bye.

223
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,459
It hurts

224
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,399
It hurts very much

225
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,999
In 1980

226
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,440
You...

227
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,249
You...

228
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,050
You...

229
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,550
You...

230
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,330
Hyun Sook!

231
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,070
You're Hyun Sook,

232
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,170
aren't you?

233
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,570
Bingo.

234
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:21,580
Your brain is working pretty fast in a dangerous situation like this.

235
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,849
But you had no idea...

236
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,249
for the past two years I worked for you.

237
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,259
You...

238
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:37,229
Are you doing this because you think I abandoned you?

239
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,969
Think about all the money I sent you.

240
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,739
I provided for you more than other kids ever wished for.

241
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,909
You have this all wrong.

242
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,440
Let's talk it out.

243
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,139
Talk it out?

244
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,379
My poor mother died because of you!

245
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,079
You cheated on her when she was sick!

246
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,349
You transferred the deed...

247
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,819
and took bribes!

248
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,989
What are you talking about?

249
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,559
Your mother received treatments...

250
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,129
at the best hospital even to her last day.

251
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,759
I spent a fortune on her treatments.

252
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,429
You think money can solve everything, right?

253
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,469
You stole her hospital.

254
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,070
It was my mom's hospital.

255
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,810
I'm going to get it back.

256
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,070
That's mine.

257
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,609
I grew it.

258
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,408
Without my help, it would've stayed a small hospital.

259
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:26,609
Fine.

260
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,879
You can think about that in your death!

261
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,050
When your bloated dead body floats up in the reservoir,

262
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,049
people will think Chairman Kim threw himself...

263
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,858
into the water on the run after getting caught.

264
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:37,859
What?

265
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,230
And I will take over the Diamond Medical Foundation!

266
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,869
Then...

267
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,969
everything will go back to its place.

268
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,469
Hey!

269
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,669
Diamond is mine!

270
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,139
No! It's mine!

271
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,609
Hyun Sook!

272
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,040
Hyun Sook!

273
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,179
Hyun Sook!

274
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,749
Kim Duk Bae hid in the laundry cart...

275
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,948
and left the hospital.

276
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,490
Whoever pushed the cart is his accomplice.

277
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,250
You haven't found any leads yet?

278
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,218
We can't let others catch him first.

279
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,590
We did all the work!

280
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,929
Captain.

281
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,330
He's not Chairman Kim.

282
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,599
You startled me. Why isn't he Chairman Kim?

283
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,339
He left his clothes and wallet.

284
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,639
And his passport is still at his house.

285
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,040
He didn't even take any of his money.

286
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,809
Isn't this really odd?

287
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,608
Why is it odd?

288
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,339
Do you think...

289
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,280
a criminal would use his passport to leave the country?

290
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,349
I'm sure he got a fake ID or something.

291
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,219
And he must have a slush fund.

292
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,189
Some things just don't add up.

293
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,060
We must consider the possibility of abduction.

294
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,819
If you want to investigate however you please,

295
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,490
what am I doing here? And what's this meeting for?

296
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,829
Do whatever you want.

297
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,858
Where do you think you can investigate this?

298
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:49,959
Okay.

299
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,369
I'll go back to Diamond and talk to Ms. Im Yoon Ju again.

300
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,668
That's insubordination, right?

301
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,379
(Writer Oh Woo Ri)

302
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,909
- Gosh. - Wait.

303
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,780
He doesn't want to see anyone.

304
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,350
Sir.

305
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,419
Come on in.

306
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,290
Please sit.

307
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,090
What is this about?

308
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,830
Well,

309
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,469
you see...

310
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,800
I don't know where to start.

311
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:32,810
Okay.

312
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,879
I understand why Dr. Song is leaving...

313
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,080
to join another hospital.

314
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,879
It's not about that.

315
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:41,649
Well,

316
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,219
I think the chairman has been wrongfully accused.

317
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,590
I didn't tell anyone.

318
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,929
And the chairman told me to take it to the grave.

319
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,159
The chairman...

320
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,270
loved me.

321
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,108
What do you mean?

322
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:11,009
Aren't you and Mr. Song known to be a devoted couple?

323
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm not embarrassed even if the world doesn't recognize...

324
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,480
me and Mr. Kim.

325
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:20,590
That's for another time.

326
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,530
But it's nonsense that Mr. Kim killed someone and fled.

327
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,529
I heard he became a suspect for being near the murder scene.

328
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,000
But that was because he was on his way to see me.

329
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,240
Wait.

330
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,639
Then, is that why he didn't mention going out to the suburbs?

331
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,909
And were you two together when he went abroad?

332
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,019
Then, why did he run away?

333
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,350
No, that's nonsense.

334
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,489
We need to find him quickly.

335
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,820
I'll tell everything to the police.

336
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,990
Right. Ms. Im.

337
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,299
She knows about us as well.

338
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,529
She planned our dates,

339
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,129
made restaurant reservations, and everything.

340
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Ms. Im?

341
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,340
You should be more careful.

342
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,549
You're pregnant.

343
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,050
It felt like a cold snake was touching me.

344
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,230
Right. Thank you.

345
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,280
- The person is not available... - Why isn't he answering the phone?

346
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,389
Kang Jae, I'm leaving a message since you're not answering.

347
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,060
I think the culprit that broke into our home is Ms. Im.

348
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,188
I followed her.

349
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:10,530
I think she's Chairman Kim.

350
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,169
Why are you doing this?

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,040
Everyone who knows that I'm Chairman Kim is dead.

352
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,480
I'm at the hospital parking lot.

353
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,580
Detective.

354
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,260
- Yes? - My Dad has an alibi.

355
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:40,128
When Shin Mi Young Lee Jong Gu died...

356
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:42,090
he was meeting someone.

357
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,000
She even said she would testify.

358
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,169
I was right. He was abducted.

359
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,600
Excuse me?

360
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,368
You have one new message.

361
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,240
Kang Jae, I'm leaving a message since you're not answering.

362
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,050
I think the culprit that broke into our home is Ms. Im.

363
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,230
Stop!

364
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,159
Stop!

365
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,320
Get out of the car!

366
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,090
Get out!

367
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:50,830
What are you doing with a gun?

368
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,129
What?

369
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,510
- No, you can't. - Step back.

370
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,388
Hang up. I need to call for backup.

371
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:56,029
No, wait. Don't hang up.

372
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,958
I'm chasing her.

373
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,730
Call the entire police department in the country if you have to.

374
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,398
Woo Ri is in trouble. She can't get hurt.

375
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,509
I know. Chase them from afar.

376
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,770
I'm coming right now.

377
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,850
Sir.

378
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,010
Yes?

379
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,349
Can you follow them from afar so that we won't get caught?

380
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,489
Of course. I've done this for 20 years.

381
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,319
What is it? Is she your wife? Is she cheating on you?

382
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,359
Excuse me?

383
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,279
Ms. Im Yoon Ju. She was Chairman Kim.

384
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,240
What nonsense are you saying?

385
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,979
Mr. Kim who fled is the suspect.

386
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,280
Ms. Im took Woo Ri as a hostage.

387
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,979
In front of my eyes.

388
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,388
What? Woo Ri was taken?

389
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:55,419
- Where are you? - I'm on the chase.

390
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:58,319
She left Gangnam and is moving towards the east.

391
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,958
All right. Kang Jae, you only pursue.

392
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,800
I'm on my way so don't do anything else until I get there. Got it?

393
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,168
Ms. Oh. Are you okay?

394
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,340
Why did you bring her here?

395
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,139
It was all my fault. Really.

396
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,148
I really regret it.

397
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:21,709
Don't hurt other people anymore.

398
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,250
I'm the only one that needs to die.

399
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,490
It's all my fault.

400
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,389
Please.

401
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,409
Hyun Sook.

402
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:06,689
Hyun Sook.

403
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,859
The next time I see you, you'll be dead.

404
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,000
Hyun Sook.

405
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,600
Hyun Sook!

406
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,639
No.

407
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,448
I sent you the location.

408
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,148
It's some kind of children's theater.

409
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,888
Right. I'll be there soon.

410
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,830
The police are on their way. Don't move until I get there.

411
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,260
All right.

412
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,800
Hyun Sook.

413
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,199
What was that?

414
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,240
Hey, how did you get here?

415
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,139
Dad?

416
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:57,510
What are you doing in there? Come out, quick.

417
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,679
Do you think I want to be in here?

418
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,850
What?

419
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,350
Gosh.

420
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,550
What is this?

421
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,050
Darn it.

422
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:10,260
There.

423
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,659
Woo Ri. Are you okay?

424
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,330
Wait. Wait a second.

425
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:19,429
What do I do with this?

426
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,549
I'm here. I'm going in.

427
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,350
No. You can't go in there alone.

428
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,379
We'll be there in five minutes. No, three.

429
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:39,790
Wait!

430
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,658
Freeze. This is the police.

431
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,329
Gosh, that's scary.

432
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,299
I know you're the police. Detective Lee Kang Jae.

433
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,859
Put your hands up and turn around.

434
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,270
Congratulations. You finally caught Chairman Kim.

435
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:00,509
But Kim Duk Bae will die if you catch me.

436
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,310
Put your hands up and turn around.

437
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,779
Kim Duk Bae will die and his son will die...

438
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,980
along with his grandchild.

439
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,448
Oh, right!

440
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,320
And you need to save your girlfriend, don't you?

441
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,490
Shut up. Stay where you are.

442
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,020
Where is Oh Woo Ri?

443
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,889
You're running out of time.

444
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,000
Kim Duk Bae will drown, and Oh Woo Ri will get electrocuted.

445
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,770
Will you be able to save any one of them?

446
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,469
Don't move or I'll shoot.

447
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,879
Make your choice.

448
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,879
Are you going to arrest me or save Oh Woo Ri?

449
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,379
Bok Rae. Listen to me.

450
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,050
Leave me.

451
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,790
It's dangerous here.

452
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,889
Take Ms. Oh and get out of here, quickly.

453
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,290
Bok Rae!

454
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:30,629
Look at my face!

455
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,300
Look at me!

456
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,139
I...

457
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,139
I should have been better to you.

458
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:46,409
I've been harsh on you...

459
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:48,810
as I felt bad for your mom dying so soon.

460
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,020
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,590
I've been a fool.

462
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,559
Please.

463
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,830
Please stop saying such meaningless things!

464
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,080
Woo Ri, you must have been startled.

465
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,178
Kang Jae. Help Mr. Kim.

466
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,918
Detective Lee!

467
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,449
Please help with this.

468
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,929
Stop.

469
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,830
You can't break that.

470
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:42,398
What do you mean?

471
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,199
My Dad's going to die.

472
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,169
There's high voltage electricity all around.

473
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,409
What do you do here?

474
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,080
What do I do?

475
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,780
Is this it?

476
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,858
There.

477
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,260
Move! Get out of the way!

478
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:36,719
Dad.

479
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,590
Dad.

480
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,230
- Dad, are you okay? - Woo Ri.

481
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:42,688
Are you all right?

482
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:44,500
It's okay now.

483
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,070
Dad.

484
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,969
Woo Ri.

485
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:54,369
Kang Jae.

486
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,740
Woo Ri.

487
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,629
What is it?

488
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,530
Wait.

489
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,469
Are you crying?

490
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,139
No.

491
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,209
I really thought you were going to die.

492
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:44,659
I'm the one who almost died. So why are you crying?

493
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,959
I called you a murderer.

494
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,429
I've been...

495
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,230
harsh on you.

496
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,369
I needed to tell you I was wrong.

497
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,679
And that I'm sorry.

498
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,909
I really thought I was losing you.

499
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,250
It's okay. It's not your fault.

500
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,549
It's all my fault.

501
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,819
I'm the one who taught you that way.

502
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,179
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,150
I've done wrong.

504
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,250
I didn't know Chairman Kim was a woman.

505
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,190
I thought she was a man since she had this on.

506
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,759
I'll find her.

507
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,698
Chairman Kim never revealed her identity before.

508
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:01,569
Would she hide now that we know her face?

509
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,169
What if we don't catch her forever?

510
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,000
I'd rather it happens that way.

511
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,339
Excuse me?

512
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,040
I mean...

513
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,580
there shouldn't be more people getting hurt.

514
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:14,579
By the way,

515
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,650
I heard Woo Ri was done with her check-up at the hospital.

516
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:20,319
Woo Ri.

517
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,548
Kang Jae.

518
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:23,889
Are you okay?

519
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,758
Did the doctors say you're all right?

520
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,830
Yes. I'm okay.

521
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,698
Why did you chase after the criminal?

522
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,428
You only needed to call it in.

523
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:35,600
What if something happened to you?

524
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,670
Why did you do such a thing?

525
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,400
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,839
Calm down. Don't get angry.

527
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,040
All right.

528
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,980
Thank you, Kang Jae.

529
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,290
I've never seen you this angry.

530
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,360
Well...

531
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:59,089
I'm sorry. Get home well.

532
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:02,060
I need to get back to the station.

533
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,159
So I'll be off.

534
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
Okay. Bye.

535
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,650
Woo Ri.

536
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:22,210
Sir.

537
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,020
I was at the hospital and they said you went home after the check-up.

538
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,619
You must have been startled.

539
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,020
I'm okay.

540
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:34,190
How's Mr. Kim? Is he okay?

541
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,799
You risked your life to save my Dad.

542
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,400
Thanks to you, his name is cleared.

543
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,000
Thank you.

544
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,710
I came to say this.

545
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,779
It's okay.

546
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,210
I hope things will be cleared.

547
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,318
If I force myself to get married, lying to myself about my feelings,

548
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:05,889
will that make the baby happy?

549
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,060
Woo Ri.

550
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,429
I better head in now.

551
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,839
You should.

552
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,239
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

553
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,460
Father!

554
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,258
Are you all right?

555
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,659
- Gosh. - Are you hurt?

556
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,399
How did you get kidnapped?

557
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,028
Isn't this crazy?

558
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:48,929
You're being too loud. My head hurts.

559
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,770
I'm sorry.

560
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,469
I was so surprised.

561
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,009
It was you, Ma Ri.

562
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,880
Yes. Yes?

563
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,619
Whenever something happened to me...

564
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,449
you were beside me.

565
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,928
Of course, it's you.

566
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,130
Good.

567
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,799
Since you're here, everything's good.

568
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,799
You should get back now.

569
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,100
Don't you have a lot to take care of at the hospital?

570
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,909
Yes. I'll be back in the evening.

571
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,380
Thank you for coming.

572
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:48,190
Father.

573
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,799
Ms. Oh Woo Ri.

574
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,929
The baby's mother broke up with Raphael.

575
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,969
What? Why?

576
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,738
They were seeing each other because of the baby.

577
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,469
It must have not worked out.

578
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,909
Father, what if I make Raphael come back to me?

579
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,580
And what if we raise the baby as well?

580
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,819
Then, isn't it a good thing they broke up?

581
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,960
Good morning, Ms. Yu.

582
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,460
Ms. Yu?

583
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,230
Are you okay?

584
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,139
We need to work on the script.

585
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,500
Are you really okay?

586
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,170
Let's work.

587
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,709
Quick. Let's go to the hospital.

588
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,908
Let's go to the hospital.

589
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:42,480
I can't be this way. I need to write the script.

590
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,719
Gosh. Ms. Yu.

591
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,019
Ms. Yu!

592
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,519
Wake up.

593
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,690
Don't shake me.

594
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,259
Don't shake me.

595
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:56,230
It's okay. I'll keep this a secret.

596
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,429
I'll tell the director that you have a herniated disk.

597
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,130
Don't worry.

598
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,770
You're the best.

599
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,569
But what about the script?

600
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,809
Ms. Yu!

601
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,908
Director, we're here.

602
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,548
My gosh! What happened? Ms. Yu!

603
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:17,650
Oh, no. What happened? Are you all right?

604
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:20,650
- Look at me! - You can't do that.

605
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,850
This patient needs absolute rest.

606
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,718
Don't do that. It'll aggravate her hemorrhoids.

607
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,860
She has hemorrhoids?

608
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:34,129
What's wrong with her?

609
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,940
Well, it's pretty serious at the moment.

610
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,739
She'll be hospitalized for two months.

611
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:41,040
Then what about our shoot?

612
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:43,110
Who will write the script?

613
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,119
Is your shoulder bothering you again?

614
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,589
Go see a doctor.

615
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,229
What's the point?

616
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,560
Doctors say the same thing all the time.

617
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,469
My gosh. Mom! What's wrong?

618
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,270
Right here, you see that the cartilage has worn down.

619
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,639
I suggest you stop working.

620
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,080
If you don't, you'll require surgery soon.

621
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,650
You have to take it easy from now on.

622
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,790
My gosh, Director. Mr. Choi.

623
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,060
Woo Ri, do you think you can write the rest?

624
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,899
Pardon? What are you talking about?

625
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,429
Our script, what else? The script for "Mask of Desire".

626
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:43,339
There's about a month left. Can you fill in and write the rest?

627
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,810
- Oh, that's... - Woo Ri.

628
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,669
Other than Ms. Yu,

629
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,408
you're the only person who knows what has happened so far...

630
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,849
and how the story is supposed to unfold.

631
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,678
Well, that is true. But...

632
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,719
Can you do it or not? You can't do it?

633
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:03,088
Well... It's...

634
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,989
I'm confident that you can do it. Let's do it.

635
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:08,130
Let's give it a shot.

636
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,739
Writer Wang! What brings you by?

637
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,679
Everyone is here.

638
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:28,649
Writer Wang, are you sure? For real?

639
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,020
Yes. My former apprentice has to drop out due to health reasons.

640
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,089
Of course, I should help out.

641
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,689
Then I'd be more than grateful.

642
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,389
Hurrah!

643
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,339
Mom, you said Chun Sam wanted to go to Jeju Island with you.

644
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,709
You should go.

645
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,540
Come on. I can't. I have to make cutlets.

646
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,778
Did you not hear what the doctor said?

647
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:01,210
If you keep this up, your shoulder will get worse. Careful.

648
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,719
From now on, I'll make all the cutlets.

649
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:08,219
You should get some rest.

650
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:12,159
Come on. I'm stepping in to relieve you so you can go on dates.

651
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,129
Ask Chun Sam to take you to nice places.

652
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,730
I can't trust you with the restaurant.

653
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,130
Besides, I can't even walk a lot because my legs hurt.

654
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,069
I know, exactly.

655
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,969
You should've traveled more when you were younger.

656
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:27,139
I'm the breadwinner of this family.

657
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,238
A breadwinner must put her family before her own self.

658
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,809
Are breadwinners not allowed to have fun at all?

659
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,449
Are they not allowed to enjoy life?

660
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,449
I couldn't because I felt bad.

661
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:40,049
For whom?

662
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,389
Your dad.

663
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:46,759
He was truly devoted to the two of us, you know.

664
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:51,060
He was only worried about us until the day he breathed his last.

665
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,630
I started this little family with him.

666
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,770
And he did his absolute best to protect our family,

667
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,540
so I wanted to do the same.

668
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,310
Mom.

669
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:09,279
You've been working hard as the breadwinner of the family,

670
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,618
and you've managed to protect this happy life that Dad built,

671
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,319
so it's about time you retired. Just travel and have some fun.

672
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,319
I'll take care of everything.

673
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,460
You'll take care of what?

674
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,689
I'll be the breadwinner of the family...

675
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,159
and run the restaurant too.

676
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,330
What's gotten into you?

677
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,869
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

678
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,270
I'm done chasing my dream of becoming a singer.

679
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,909
So it's time you retired from being our breadwinner.

680
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:42,310
I will be the family's breadwinner until Woo Ri can take over.

681
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:44,679
Eun Ran.

682
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,219
Mother, I heard you went to see a doctor... Oh, your arm!

683
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,218
What happened? Are you okay?

684
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:56,690
I'm fine. Actor Choi, are you busy today?

685
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,599
Stay for dinner. I'll grill some beef.

686
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,669
Beef? Is it some kind of special day?

687
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,239
No, not at all.

688
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,940
I think that life is a party every day.

689
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,009
So we're throwing another party today!

690
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,679
Hey, what are you doing here? How did you get in?

691
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,960
Can't you see what I'm doing? I fixed dinner for you.

692
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,988
Let's have dinner together.

693
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,989
You never did this even when we were married.

694
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,889
What's up with you?

695
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,500
Right?

696
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,440
I realized it too late.

697
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,839
Now that I've had a chance to see you from a distance,

698
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,850
I can see that what you wanted and needed was a normal family.

699
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,889
I made soybean paste stew for you to show you that I truly care.

700
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,290
Ma Ri, I...

701
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,560
I won't pester you anymore.

702
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,069
I will wait quietly until you can see that I am being sincere.

703
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,130
While taking care of Father...

704
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,940
and helping you with the business. I'll wait for you.

705
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,940
Today, let's just have dinner together.

706
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,889
I don't want to.

707
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:41,770
Why not?

708
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,338
I'm only asking you to have dinner with me.

709
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,469
Ma Ri.

710
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,369
Stop trying.

711
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:51,909
This won't work out, ever.

712
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,080
- Why are you being like this? - Fine.

713
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:01,989
Since you can't seem to move on, I'll just tell it like it is.

714
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,589
Why do you think I asked for a divorce...

715
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,830
as soon as I recovered from a near-death situation?

716
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,270
You see, I had an inkling from the get-go, so I asked around.

717
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:19,670
I had so much time on my hands while undergoing treatment.

718
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:26,110
You conned me.

719
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,520
What? What are you talking about?

720
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,818
What do you mean I conned you?

721
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,250
You lied that you were pregnant so I'd marry you.

722
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:36,949
You schemed with the doctor...

723
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,989
and lied to me that you were pregnant.

724
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:42,989
I knew about it all along.

725
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,798
Honey, that's... I was that desperate to...

726
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:53,939
Forget it. Let's end this once and for all.

727
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,009
I didn't tell Dad because of the hospital.

728
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,580
I'm really sorry, but leave now.

729
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:04,250
It's not what you think.

730
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,519
Hear me out, please.

731
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,219
No, I don't want to listen to what you have to say.

732
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,029
Forget it. I'll leave.

733
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:37,149
Kang Jae, I'll come by and see you soon.

734
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,250
I have something to tell you.

735
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,690
Woo Ri and Raphael broke up.

736
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,380
Ma'am, you should go home and sleep.

737
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,549
No, it's fine.

738
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,350
Oh, boy. How far along are you?

739
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,689
I'm almost done,

740
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,359
but I'll need you to go over it once.

741
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,389
Really?

742
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,730
You're fast.

743
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,928
All right, then. I'll go home and get some sleep.

744
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:01,670
Call me when you're done, okay?

745
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,839
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:07,940
Get home safely.

747
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:19,319
("Mask of Desire")

748
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:24,089
Writer Wang, I was worried for nothing.

749
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,460
It's 50,000 times better than Ms. Yu's scripts.

750
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,089
You never let me down, Writer Wang.

751
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,690
All hail Writer Wang! You're the best!

752
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,159
I'm glad you like it.

753
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,528
Did you stay up all night?

754
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,829
How did you get it done so quickly?

755
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,669
So we now have some time to spare, right?

756
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,738
Yes, sure thing.

757
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,969
Then let's visit Ms. Yu together at the hospital.

758
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,440
Okay, sounds great.

759
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,420
Gwi Nyeo.

760
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,420
Are you really going to upload this on the Internet?

761
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,289
These days, video content is more popular...

762
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,060
than photos or written posts.

763
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,829
I need to get with the times.

764
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,230
I know that,

765
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,900
but who'd want to watch someone patching up holes in socks?

766
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,069
I'm sorry to interrupt.

767
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,799
My goodness. Look who's here!

768
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:15,469
Hello.

769
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:17,009
Are you making a video of something?

770
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:19,179
No, I'm just playing around. Anyway...

771
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,980
Hey, what brings you here?

772
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,119
Grandma, the thing is...

773
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:28,850
I heard.

774
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,790
I actually thought of visiting you.

775
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,860
What happened?

776
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,330
It's my fault that we broke up.

777
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,759
I regret it so much.

778
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,630
I want to undo what happened,

779
00:51:43,069 --> 00:51:45,569
but I don't know how. It's killing me inside.

780
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:48,969
I'm here because I wanted to get your advice.

781
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,750
- Writer Wang. - My goodness.

782
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,719
You came all the way here, but I can't even greet you properly.

783
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:07,790
I'm sorry.

784
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:09,529
Gosh, it's okay.

785
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:11,460
You need to take care of yourself.

786
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,469
How hard did you work that you ended up with hemorrhoids?

787
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,670
Don't worry about the drama. Just focus on your recovery.

788
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:20,199
Writer Wang helped us out, so all's been taken care of.

789
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,069
We already have the next script ready.

790
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:23,739
It worked out for the best.

791
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,810
Well...

792
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:28,850
Writer Wang.

793
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:31,250
Thank you so much...

794
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:33,819
for stepping in to help us out,

795
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,889
but I think...

796
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,259
we can have Woo Ri take care of the rest.

797
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,199
Ms. Yu, what are you doing?

798
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:52,540
You see, I worked with Woo Ri for years.

799
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,869
She's emotionally delicate and sensitive.

800
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,638
I can see that there's a lot inside,

801
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,540
but she doesn't really know how to share it with others.

802
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,279
And she prefers to stay in the shadows.

803
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:07,279
Right, she used to be like that.

804
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,049
But she's grown a lot.

805
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,460
And she's becoming a mother.

806
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,259
Ye Ri, Director Park. Listen carefully.

807
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:19,729
There are quiet ones who you don't notice.

808
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,630
But if you take a closer look, they are actually very talented.

809
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,138
As seniors in the industry,

810
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:27,170
we must guide them so they can flaunt their talents.

811
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,009
I say this because...

812
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:31,339
I am...

813
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:34,750
I mean, I was one of them too.

814
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,350
Woo Ri.

815
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,150
You're talented. You've got all the nuts and bolts.

816
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:46,360
I'm here to make sure you wouldn't let this opportunity pass.

817
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,960
Writer Wang.

818
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,459
I came here to get Ye Ri's permission,

819
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,299
but she was thinking the exact same thing.

820
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,400
Director Park.

821
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,500
I didn't write a single word in the script you read.

822
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,909
It was all Woo Ri.

823
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,139
Seriously?

824
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:08,980
Woo Ri, you wrote it?

825
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,279
You're good, Woo Ri.

826
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,779
Be polite.

827
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,948
From now on,

828
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,389
call her Writer Oh.

829
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,630
- Congratulations, Woo Ri. - Congratulations, Woo Ri.

830
00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:25,960
Thank you.

831
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:29,730
Our dear Woo Ri is finally making her debut as a drama writer.

832
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,838
A drama starring me.

833
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,569
My gosh, I'm over the moon right now.

834
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,669
I'm only filling in.

835
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,210
I'll do my best though.

836
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,408
My dear daughter, all your dreams will come true.

837
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,779
I'm always rooting for you.

838
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:42,549
Thanks, Mom.

839
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,880
Hold on. He should be here any minute now.

840
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:46,949
Someone else is coming?

841
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,749
Yes.

842
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:50,859
Who?

843
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,319
I invited someone too.

844
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,230
He should be here any second now.

845
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:55,830
What? Who?

846
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,279
Hi, Lee Ma Ri.

847
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,009
No, you are Lee Mal Ja.

848
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,009
You...

849
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,880
What the heck are you doing here?

850
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,679
I came to retrieve what belongs to me.

851
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,449
Here you go.

852
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,819
It's an important list. You should take it.

853
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,199
Fine.

854
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,230
It's all over now.

855
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:38,869
The Diamond Medical Foundation...

856
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:40,940
and Raphael too.

857
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,569
It really is over now.

858
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,440
I want them all out of my sight.

859
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,509
What is this now?

860
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,850
Don't you dare put on an act in front of me.

861
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,319
I know that you've been sticking by the chairman's side...

862
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:57,619
to get a building out of it.

863
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:00,020
Right, that's how it all began.

864
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,060
I was a crazy fool for thinking that things could work out with Raphael.

865
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:06,799
Really?

866
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,469
It's not going well, right?

867
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,969
Ma'am.

868
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,009
Since you've retrieved the list, please leave...

869
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:17,880
I mean, we'll just disappear quietly.

870
00:56:19,279 --> 00:56:22,449
You know that we can't even call the police.

871
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,560
Lee Mal Ja.

872
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,119
Do you...

873
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:35,889
want to be the boss?

874
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:38,400
What?

875
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,659
I can make you...

876
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:42,929
the chairwoman of the Diamond Medical Foundation.

877
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,860
All right.

878
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,659
They're both here to congratulate Woo Ri,

879
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,638
so let's celebrate together by making a toast.

880
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:19,439
Here's to Woo Ri. Cheers!

881
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,469
Stop.

882
00:57:23,509 --> 00:57:24,610
I'll just eat my food quietly.

883
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:33,980
Are you leaving?

884
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:36,089
Sit down. Where are you going?

885
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:41,659
Woo Ri.

886
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:44,060
Spare me a moment.

887
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,199
Woo Ri.

888
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,339
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

889
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:53,170
I thought long and hard.

890
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,139
When we broke up,

891
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:58,679
I was wrong about so many things.

892
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,850
Spending some time apart taught me...

893
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:05,980
that you're all I need.

894
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:08,520
I just need you,

895
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:11,159
and I don't care about anything else.

896
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,459
No, wait!

897
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,929
Stop! Wait!

898
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,460
Sorry. I startled you, didn't I?

899
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:20,460
Darn you.

900
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:25,069
Woo Ri.

901
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,239
I was wrong.

902
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:30,339
- What... - I'll be mindful of your pace.

903
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,278
I don't need anything else.

904
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:33,580
I'll only think about the two of us.

905
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,679
I hope you know that I mean it.

906
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,319
- Please... - Let's start over!

907
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,759
- Date me! - Date me, please!

908
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,069
(Woori the Virgin)

909
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,298
Woo Ri, which one?

910
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,040
Raphael or Detective Lee?

911
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,170
I want to start over with you.

912
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:37,009
Will you give me another chance?

913
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,009
Who should I choose?

914
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,150
I am the first man she kissed.

915
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,250
I know you the best.

916
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:45,879
If I can't have it,

917
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,649
I must get rid of it.

918
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,020
I'll get it out of your sight.

919
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:52,189
If it's for Woo Ri and Bok Dol, I can do anything.

920
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,759
Woo Ri, raise the baby with me.

921
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,029
To tell you the truth,

922
00:59:55,889 --> 00:59:57,330
I've already made up my mind.

923
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:05,569
